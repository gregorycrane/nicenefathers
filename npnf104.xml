<head>NPNF1-04. Augustine: The Writings Against the
Manichaeans and Against the Donatists</head>

<pb n="ii"/>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series. The first series focuses on two classical Christian
theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. St.
Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most
popular two works--the Confessions and the City of
God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important
works of St. Augustine, such as On the Holy Trinity,
Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom was an
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St.
John took a more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much
of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly
what is now called social justice. He advocated for
the poor, and challenged abuses of authority. This particular
volume contains Augustine's writings against the Donatists
and Manichaeism--a form of Gnosticism. The Nicene and
Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope, and provide
keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from
some of the greatest theologians of the Christian church.
These spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for
over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful
even today!

<p>The Supreme Good is that Which is Possessed of Supreme Existence. 115</p>

<p>Title Page. 158</p>
<p>By What Course of Reasoning the Error of the Manichæans Concerning Two
Souls, One of Which is Not from God, is Refuted. Every Soul, Inasmuch as It
is a Certain Life, Can Have Its Existence Only from God the Source of Life.159</p>
<p>If the Light that is Perceived by Sense Has God for Its Author, as the Manichæans
Acknowledge, Much More The Soul Which is Perceived by Intellect Alone.161</p>
<p>How It is Proved that Every Body Also is from God. That the Soul Which is
Called Evil by the Manichæans is Better Than Light.163</p>
<p>Even the Soul of a Fly is More Excellent Than the Light. 165</p>
<p>How Vicious Souls, However Worthy of Condemnation They May Be, Excel
the Light Which is Praiseworthy in Its Kind.166</p>
<p>Whether Even Vices Themselves as Objects of Intellectual Apprehension are
to Be Preferred to Light as an Object of Sense Perception, and are to Be Attributed
to God as Their Author. Vice of the Mind and Certain Defects are Not Rightly
to Be Counted Among Intelligible Things. Defects Themselves Even If They
Should Be Counted Among Intelligible Things Should Never Be Put Before
Sensible Things. If Light is Visible by God, Much More is the Soul, Even If
Vicious, Which in So Far as It Lives is an Intelligible Thing. Passages of Scripture
are Adduced by the Manichæans to the Contrary.167</p>
<p>How Evil Men are of God, and Not of God. 170</p>
<p>The Manichæans Inquire Whence is Evil and by This Question Think They
Have Triumphed. Let Them First Know, Which is Most Easy to Do, that Nothing
Can Live Without God. Consummate Evil Cannot Be Known Except by the
Knowledge of Consummate Good, Which is God.172</p>
<p>Augustin Deceived by Familiarity with the Manichæans, and by the Succession
of Victories Over Ignorant Christians Reported by Them. The Manichæans
are Likewise Easily Refuted from the Knowledge of Sin and the Will.174</p>
<p>Sin is Only from the Will. His Own Life and Will Best Known to Each
Individual. What Will is.175</p>
<p>What Sin is. 179</p>

<pb n="vii"/>
<p>From the Definitions Given of Sin and Will, He Overthrows the Entire Heresy
of the Manichæans. Likewise from the Just Condemnation of Evil Souls It
Follows that They are Evil Not by Nature But by Will. That Souls are Good By
Nature, to Which the Pardon of Sins is Granted.180</p>
<p>From Deliberation on the Evil and on the Good Part It Results that Two Classes
of Souls are Not to Be Held to. A Class of Souls Enticing to Shameful Deeds
Having Been Conceded, It Does Not Follow that These are Evil by Nature, that
the Others are Supreme Good.183</p>
<p>Again It is Shown from the Utility of Repenting that Souls are Not by Nature
Evil. So Sure a Demonstration is Not Contradicted Except from the Habit of
Erring.186</p>

<p>The Manichæans are Reduced to the Choice of a Tortuous, or Curved, or Straight
Line of Junction. The Third Kind of Line Would Give Symmetry and Beauty
Suitable to Both Regions.241</p>
<p>The Beauty of the Straight Line Might Be Taken from the Region of Darkness
Without Taking Anything from Its Substance. So Evil Neither Takes from Nor
Adds to the Substance of the Soul. The Straightness of Its Side Would Be So

<p>Conclusion. 263</p>
<p>Reply to Faustus the Manichæan. 264</p>
<p>Title Page. 264</p>
<p>Preface. 265</p>
<p>Who Faustus was. Faustus’s object in writing the polemical treatise that forms
the basis of Augustin’s reply. Augustin’s remarks thereon.266</p>
<p>Faustus claims to believe the Gospel, yet refuses to accept the genealogical tables
on various grounds which Augustin seeks to set aside.268</p>
<p>Faustus objects to the incarnation of God on the ground that the evangelists are
at variance with each other, and that incarnation is unsuitable to deity. Augustin
attempts to remove the critical and theological difficulties.273</p>
<p>Faustus’s reasons for rejecting the Old Testament, and Augustin’s animadversions
thereon.277</p>
<p>Faustus claims that the Manichæans and not the Catholics are consistent believers
in the Gospel, and seeks to establish this claim by comparing Manichæan and
Catholic obedience to the precepts of the Gospel. Augustin exposes the hypocrisy
of the Manichæans and praises the asceticism of Catholics. 279</p>
<p>Faustus avows his disbelief in the Old Testament and his disregard of its precepts,
and accuses Catholics of inconsistency in neglecting its ordinances, while
claiming to accept it as authoritative. Augustin explains the Catholic view of
the relation of the Old Testament to the New 287.</p>
<p>The genealogical question is again taken up and argued on both sides. 298</p>

<pb n="x"/>
<p>Faustus maintains that to hold to the Old Testament after the giving of the New
is putting new cloth on an old garment. Augustin further explains the relation
of the Old Testament to the New, and reproaches the Manichæans with carnality.300</p>
<p>Faustus argues that if the apostles born under the old covenant could lawfully
depart from it, much more can he having been born a Gentile. Augustin explains
the relation of Jews and Gentiles alike to the Gospel.302</p>
<p>Faustus insists that the Old Testament promises are radically different from
those of the New. Augustin admits a difference, but maintains that the moral
precepts are the same in both.304</p>
<p>Faustus quotes passages to show that the Apostle Paul abandoned belief in the
incarnation, to which he earlier held. Augustin shows that the apostle was
consistent with himself in the utterances quoted.306</p>
<p>Faustus denies that the prophets predicted Christ. Augustin proves such
prediction from the New Testament, and expounds at length the principal types
of Christ in the Old Testament.315</p>
<p>Faustus asserts that even if the Old Testament could be shown to contain
predictions, it would be of interest only to the Jews, pagan literature subserving
the same purpose for Gentiles. Augustin shows the value of prophesy for Gentiles
and Jews alike.343</p>
<p>Faustus abhors Moses for the awful curse he has pronounced upon Christ.
Augustin expounds the Christian doctrine of the suffering Saviour by comparing
Old and New Testament passages.357</p>
<p>Faustus rejects the Old Testament because it leaves no room for Christ. Christ
the one Bridegroom suffices for His Bride the Church. Augustin answers as
well as he can, and reproves the Manichæans with presumption in claiming to
be the Bride of Christ.365</p>
<p>Faustus willing to believe not only that the Jewish but that all Gentile prophets
wrote of Christ, if it should be proved; but he would none the less insist upon
rejecting their superstitions. Augustin maintains that all Moses wrote is of
Christ, and that his writings must be either accepted or rejected as a whole.378</p>
<p>Faustus rejects Christ’s declaration that He came not to destroy the law and the
prophets but to fulfill them, on the ground that it is found only in Matthew,
who was not present when the words purport to have been spoken. Augustin
rebukes the folly of refusing to believe Matthew and yet believing Manichæus,
and shows what the passage of scripture really means.403</p>
<p>The relation of Christ to prophecy, continued. 408</p>
<p>Faustus is willing to admit that Christ may have said that He came not to destroy
the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them; but if He did, it was to pacify the</p>

<pb n="xi"/>
<p>Jews and in a modified sense. Augustin replies, and still further elaborates the
Catholic view of prophecy and its fulfillment.412</p>
<p>Faustus repels the charge of sun-worship, and maintains that while the
Manichæans believe that God’s power dwells in the sun and his wisdom in the
moon, they yet worship one deity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are not
a schism of the Gentiles, nor a sect. Augustin emphasizes the charge of
polytheism, and goes into an elaborate comparison of Manichæan and pagan
mythology.435</p>
<p>Faustus denies that Manichæans believe in two gods. Hyle no god. Augustin
discusses at large the doctrine of God and Hyle, and fixes the charge of dualism
upon the Manichæans.454</p>
<p>Faustus states his objections to the morality of the law and the prophets, and
Augustin seeks by the application of the type and the allegory to explain away
the moral difficulties of the Old Testament.468</p>
<p>Faustus recurs to the genealogical difficulty and insists that even according to
Matthew Jesus was not Son of God until His baptism. Augustin sets forth the
Catholic view of the relation of the divine and the human in the person of Christ.536</p>
<p>Faustus explains the Manichæan denial that man was made by God as applying
to the fleshly man not to the spiritual. Augustin elucidates the Apostle Paul’s
contrasts between flesh and spirit so as to exclude the Manichæan view.543</p>
<p>Faustus seeks to bring into ridicule the orthodox claim to believe in the infinity
of God by caricaturing the anthropomorphic representations of the Old
Testament. Augustin expresses his despair of being able to induce the
Manichæans to adopt right views of the infinitude of God so long as they
continue to regard the soul and God as extended in space.548</p>
<p>Faustus insists that Jesus might have died though not born, by the exercise of
divine power, yet he rejects birth and death alike. Augustin maintains that there
are some things that even God cannot do, one of which is to die. He refutes the
docetism of the Manichæans.550</p>
<p>Faustus warns against pressing too far the argument, that if Jesus was not born
He cannot have suffered. Augustin accepts the birth and death alike on the
testimony of the Gospel narrative, which is higher authority than the falsehood
of Manichæus.556</p>
<p>Faustus recurs to the genealogy and insists upon examining it as regards its
consistency with itself. Augustin takes his stand on Scripture authority and
maintains that Matthew’s statements as to the birth of Christ must be accepted
as final.557</p>

<pb n="xii"/>
<p>Faustus seeks to justify the docetism of the Manichæans. Augustin insists that
there is nothing disgraceful in being born.560</p>
<p>Faustus repels the insinuation that the prophecy of Paul with reference to those
that should forbid to marry, abstain from meats, etc., applies to the Manichæans
more than to the Catholic ascetics, who are held in the highest esteem in the
Church. Augustin justifies this application of the prophecy, and shows the
difference between Manichæan and Christian asceticism.563</p>
<p>The scripture passage: ‘To the pure all things are pure, but to the impure and
defiled is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled,’ is
discussed from both the Manichæan and the Catholic points of view, Faustus
objecting to its application to his party and Augustin insisting on its application.568</p>
<p>Faustus fails to understand why he should be required either to accept or reject
the New Testament as a whole, while the Catholics accept or reject the various
parts of the Old Testament at pleasure. Augustin denies that the Catholics treat
the Old Testament arbitrarily, and explains their attitude towards it.571</p>
<p>Faustus does not think it would be a great honor to sit down with Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, whose moral characters as set forth in the Old Testament he
detests. He justifies his subjective criticism of Scripture. Augustin sums up the
argument, claims the victory, and exhorts the Manichæans to abandon their
opposition to the Old Testament notwithstanding the difficulties that it presents,
and to recognize the authority of the Catholic Church.585</p>

<p>In which Augustin proves that it is to no purpose that the Donatists bring
forward the authority of Cyprian, bishop and martyr, since it is really more
opposed to them than to the Catholics. For that he held that the view of his
predecessor Agrippinus, on the subject of baptizing heretics in the Catholic
Church when they join its communion, should only be received on condition
that peace should be maintained with those who entertained the opposite view,
and that the unity of the Church should never be broken by any kind of schism.732</p>

<p>In this book Augustin refutes the second letter which Petilianus wrote to him
after having seen the first of Augustin’s earlier books. This letter had been full
of violent language; and Augustin rather shows that the arguments of Petilianus
had been deficient and irrelevant, than brings forward arguments in support of
his own statements.1185</p>

<head>Editor’s Preface</head>
<p>This fourth volume of St. Augustin’s Works contains his polemical writings in vindication
of the Catholic Church against the heresy of the Manichæans, and the schism of the
Donatists. The former are contained in Tom. II. and VIII., the latter in Tom. IX., of the
Benedictine edition.</p>
<p>Like the preceding volumes, this also is more than a reprint of older translations, and
contains important additions not previously published.</p>
<p>I.—Seven Writings Against the Manichæan Heresy. Four of these were translated by
the Rev. Richard Stothert, of Bombay, for Dr. Dods’ edition, published by T.U+0026T. Clark,
Edinburgh, 1872, and revised by Dr. Albert H. Newman, of Toronto, for the American
edition. The other three treatises are translated, I believe for the first time, by Dr. Newman
for this edition. (See Contents.)</p>
<p>The Edinburgh translation, especially of the first two treatises, is sufficiently faithful
and idiomatic, and needed very little alteration by the American editor, who compared it
sentence by sentence with the Latin original, and made changes only where they seemed
necessary.</p>
<p>This part of the volume is also enriched by an introductory essay of Dr. Newman, which
embodies the literature and the results of the most recent as well as the earlier researches
concerning that anti-Christian heresy.</p>
<p>II.—The Writings Against the Donatists. These were well translated by the Rev. J. R.
King, of Oxford, and are slightly revised by Dr. Hartranft, of Hartford, after a careful comparison
with the Latin.</p>
<p>The literary introduction of Dr. Hartranft, in connection with the translator’s historical
preface, will place the reader in the situation of the controversy between the Catholic Church
and the Donatists at the time of St. Augustin.</p>
<p>In both sections the treatises are arranged in chronological order.</p>
<p>The fifth volume will contain the writings of St. Augustin against the Pelagians and
Semi-Pelagians. It is in the hands of the printer and will be published in October.</p>

<p>I. Sources.</p>
<p>The following bibliography of Manichæism is taken from Schaff’s History of the Christian
Church, vol. II. pp. 498–500 (new edition). Additions are indicated by brackets.</p>
<p>1. Oriental Sources: The most important, though of comparatively late date.</p>
<p>(a) Mohammedan (Arabic): Kitâb al Fihrist. A history of Arabic literature to 987, by
an Arab of Bagdad, usually called Ibn Abi Jakub An-Nadîm; brought to light by Flügel, and
published after his death by Rödiger and Müller, in 2 vols. Leipz. 1871-’72. Book IX. section
first, treats of Manichæism. Flügel’s translation, see below. Kessler calls the Fihrist a
"Fündstätte allerersten Ranges." Next to it comes the relation of the Mohammedan philosopher,
Al-Shahrastani (d. 1153), in his History of Religious Parties and Philosophical Sects,
Ed. Cureton, Lond. 1842, 2 vols. (I. 188–192); German translation by Haarbrücker, Halle,
1851. On other Mohammedan sources, see Kessler in Herzog, IX., 225 sq.</p>
<p>(b) Persian Sources: relating to the life of Mani, the Shâhnâmeh (the King’s Book) of
Firdausi; ed. by Jul. Mohl, Paris, 1866 (V. 472–475). See Kessler, ibid. 225.</p>
<p><del>Albiruni’s Chronology of Ancient Nations, tr. by E. Sachau, and published by the Oriental
Translation Fund, Lond. 1879. Albîrunî lived 973–1048, and is said to have possessed
vast literary resources no longer available to us. His work seems to be based on early
Manichæan sources, and strikingly confirms the narrative preserved by the Fihrist. See also
articles by West and Thomas in Journal of the Asiatic Society, 1868, 1870, 1871.</del></p>
<p>(c) Christian Sources: In Arabic, the Alexandrian Patriarch Eutychius (d. 916). Annales,
ed. Pococke, Oxon. 1628; Barhebræus (d. 1286), in his Historia Dynastiarum, ed. Pococke.
In Syriac: Ephraem Syrus (d. 393), in various writings. Esnig or Esnik, an Armenian bishop
of the 5th Century, who wrote against Marcion and Mani (German translation from the
Armenian by C. Fr. Neumann, in Illgen’s Zeitschrift für die Hist. Theologie, 1834, pp.77–78).</p>
<p>2. Greek Sources: <del>Alexander of Lycopolis: The Tenets of the Manichæans (first published
by Combefis, with a Latin version, in the Auctararium Novissimum, Bibl. S. S. Patrum;
again by Gallandi, in his Bibl. Patrum, vol. IV. p. 73 sq. An English translation by Rev. James
B.H. Hawkins, M .A ., appeared in Clark’s Ante-Nicene Library, Vol. XIV. p. 236 sq.; Am.
ed. vol. VI. p. 237 sq. Alexander represents himself as a convert from Paganism to
Manichæism, and from Manichæism to Orthodoxy. He claims to have learned Manichæism
from those who were intimately associated with Mani himself, and is, therefore, one of the
earliest witnesses.1</del> Eusebius (H. E. VII. 31, a brief account). Epiphanius (Haer. 66). Cyril
of Jerusalem (Catech. VI. 20 sq.). Titus of Bostra (πρὸσ Μανιχαίουσ, ed P. de Lagarde,
1859). Photius: Adv. Manichæos (Cod. 179, Biblioth.). John of Damascus: De Haeres. and
Dial. <del>Petrus Siculus, Hist. Manichæorum.</del></p>
<note type="footnote">1 Baur discredits this claim on internal grounds (Das Manich. Religionssystem, p. 7).</note>

<pb n="9"/>
<p>3. Latin Sources: Archelaus (Bishop of Cascar in Mesopotamia, d. about 278): Acta
Disputationis cum Manete Hæresiarcha; first written in Syriac, and so far belonging to the
Oriental Christian Sources (Comp. Jerome, de Vir. Ill. 72), but extant only in a Latin translation,
which seems to have been made from the Greek, edited by Zacagni (Rome, 1698),
and Routh (in Reliquiæ Sacræ, vol. V. 3–206); Eng. transl. in Clark’s Ante-Nicene Library
(vol. XX. 272–419). <del>Am. ed. vol. VI. p. 173 sq.</del>. These Acts purport to contain the report
of a disputation between Archelaus and Mani before a large assembly, which was in full
sympathy with the orthodox bishop, but (as Beausobre first proved), they are in form a fiction
from the first quarter of the fourth century (about 320), by a Syrian ecclesiastic (probably
of Edessa), yet based upon Manichæan documents, and containing much information about
Manichæan doctrines. They consist of various pieces, and were the chief source of information
to the West. Mani is represented (ch. 12), as appearing in a many-colored cloak and
trousers, with a sturdy staff of ebony, a Babylonian book under his left arm, and with a mien
of an old Persian master. In his defense he quotes freely from the N.T. At the end, he makes
his escape to Persia (ch. 55). Comp. H. V. Zittwitz: Die Acta Archelai et Manetis untersucht,
in Kahnis’ Zeitschrift für d. Hist. Theol. 1873, No. IV. Oblasinski: Acta Disput. Arch., etc.
Lips. 1874 (inaugural dissert.). Ad. Harnack: Die Acta Archelai und das Diatessaron Tatians,
in Texte und Untersuchungen zur Gesch. der altchristl. Lit. vol. I. Heft 3 (1883), p. 137–153.
Harnack tries to prove that the Gospel variations of Archelaus are taken from Tatian’s
Diatessaron.</p>
<p>St. Augustin (d. 430, the chief Latin authority next to the translation of Archelaus).
<del>Besides the treatises published in Clark’s series, Contra Fortunatum quendam
Manichæorum Presbyterum Disput. I. et II., Contra Adimantum Manichæi discipulum,
Contra Secundinum Manichæum, De Natura Boni, De duabus Animabus, De Utilitate Credendi,
De Haeres. XLVI. Of these, De duabus Animabus, Contra Fortunatum, and De Natura
Boni are added in the present edition, and De Utilitate Credendi has been included among
Augustin’s shorter theological treatises in vol. III. of the present series. In the Confessions
and the Letters, moreover, the Manichæans figure prominently. The treatises included in
the present series may be said to fairly represent Augustin’s manner of dealing with
Manichæism. The Anti-Manichæan writings are found chiefly in vol. VIII. of the Benedictine
edition, and in volumes I. and XI. of the Migne reprint. Augustin’s personal connection
with the sect extending over a period of nine years, and his consummate ability in dealing
with this form of error, together with the fact that he quotes largely from Manichæan literature,
render his works the highest authority for Manichæism as it existed in the West at
the close of the fifth century.</del> Comp. also the Acts of Councils against the Manichæans
from the fourth century onwards, in Mansi and Hefele <del>and Hardouin</del>.</p>

<p>II. Modern Works.</p>
<p>Isaac de Beausobre (b. 1659 in France, pastor of the French church in Berlin, d. 1738):
Histoire Crit. de Manichée et du Manichéisme, Amst. 1634 and ’39, 2 vols. 4to. Part of the
first volume is historical, the second doctrinal. Very full and scholarly. He intended to
write a third volume on the later Manichæans. F. Chr. Baur: Das Manichäische Religions-
system nach den Quellen neu untersucht und entwickelt, Tüb. 1831 (500 pages). A compre
hensive, philosophical and critical view. He calls the Manich. system a "glühend prächtiges
Natur-und Weltgedicht." <del>An able critique of Baur’s work by Schneckenburger appeared
in the "Theol. Studien u. Kritiken," 1833, p. 875 sq. Schneckenburger strives to make it appear
that Baur unduly minifies the Christian element in Manichæism. Later researches have
tended to confirm Baur’s main position. The Oriental sources employed by Flügel and
Kessler have thrown much light upon the character of primitive Manichæism, and have
enabled us to determine more precisely than Beausobre and Baur were able to do the constituent
elements of Mani’s system. A.V. Wegnern: Manichæorum Indulgentiæ, Lips. 1827.
Wegnern points out the resemblance between the Manichæan system, in accordance with
which the "hearers" participate in the merits of the "elect" without subjecting themselves to
the rigorous asceticism practiced by the latter, and the later doctrine and practice of indulgences
in the Roman Catholic church.</del> Trechsel: Ueber Kanon, Kritik und Exegese der
Manichäer, Bern, 1832. D. Chwolson: Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus, Petersb. 1856, 2 vols.
G. Flugel: Mani, seine Lehre und seine Scriften. Aus dem Fihrist des Abî Jakub an-Nadîm
(987), Leipz. 1862. Text, translation and commentary, 440 pages. <del>Of the highest value, the
principal document on which the work is based being, probably, the most authentic exposition
of primitive Manichæan doctrine.</del> K. Kessler: Untersuchungen zur Genesis des Manich.
Rel. Systems, Leipz. 1876. By the same: Mânî oder Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Religionsmischung
im Semitismus, Leipz. 1887. See also his thorough article, Mânî und die Manichær,
in "Herzog," new ed. vol. IX. 223–259 (abridged in Schaff’s "Encyclop." II. 1396–1398).
<del>Kessler has done more than any other writer to establish the relation between the
Manichæans and the earlier Oriental sects, and between these and the old Babylonian religion.
The author of this introduction wishes to express his deep obligation to Kessler. The
article on the "Mandäer" in "Herzog," by the same author, is valuable in this connection,
though his attempt to exclude all historical connection between this Babylonian Gnostic
sect and Palestine can hardly be pronounced a success. J. B. Mozley: Ruling Ideas in Early
Ages; lecture on "The Manichæans and the Jewish Fathers," with special reference to Augustin’s
method of dealing with the cavils of the Manichæans.</del> G. T. Stokes: Manes and
Manichæans, in "Smith and Wace," III. 792–801. A. Harnack: Manichæism in 9th ed. of
the "Encycl. Britannica," vol. XV. (1883), 481–487. <del>Also in German, as a Beigabe to his
Lehrbuch d. Dogmengeschichte, vol. I. p. 681 sq. Harnack follows Kessler in all essential
particulars. Of Kessler’s article in "Herzog" he says: "This article contains the best that we</del>

<pb n="11"/>
<del>possess on Manichæism." In this we concur. W. Cunningham: S. Austin and his Place in
the History of Christian Thought, Hulsean Lectures, 1885, p. 45–72, and passim, Lond. 1886.
This treatise is of considerable value, especially as it regards the philosophical attitude of
Augustin towards Manichæism.</del> The accounts of Mosheim, Lardner, Schröckh, Walch,

<head>Chapter II.—Philosophical Basis, and Antecedents of Manichæism.</head>
<p>"About 500 years before the commencement of the Christian era," writes Professor
Monier Williams,2 "a great stir seems to have taken place in Indo-Aryan, as in Grecian
minds, and indeed in thinking minds everywhere throughout the then civilized world. Thus
when Buddha arose in India, Greece had her thinkers in Pythagoras, Persia in Zoroaster,
and China in Confucius. Men began to ask themselves earnestly such questions as—What
am I? Whence have I come? Whither am I going? How can I explain my consciousness of
personal existence? What is the relationship between my material and immaterial nature?
What is the world in which I find myself? did a wise, good and all-powerful Being create it
out of nothing? or did it evolve out of an eternal germ? or did it come together by the combination
of eternal atoms? If created by a Being of infinite wisdom, how can I account for
the inequality of condition in it—good and evil, happiness and misery. Has the Creator
form or is he formless? Has he any qualities or none?"</p>
<p>It is true that such questions pressed themselves with special importunity upon the
thinkers of the age mentioned, but we should be far astray if we should think for a moment
that now for the first time they suggested themselves and demanded solution. The fact is
that the earliest literary records of the human race bear evidence of high thinking on the
fundamental problems of God, man, and the world, and the relations of these to each other.
Recent scholars have brought to light facts of the utmost interest with reference to the pre-
Babylonian (Accadian) religion. A rude nature-worship, with a pantheistic basis, but assuming
a polytheistic form, seems to have prevailed in Mesopotamia from a very early period.
"Spirit everywhere dispersed produced all the phenomena of nature, and directed and animated
all created beings. They caused evil and good, guided the movements of the celestial
bodies, brought back the seasons in their order, made the wind to blow and the rain to fall,
and produced by their influence atmospheric phenomena both beneficial and destructive;
they also rendered the earth fertile, and caused plants to germinate and to bear fruit, presided
over the births and preserved the lives of living beings, and yet at the same time sent death
and disease. There were spirits of this kind everywhere, in the starry heavens, in the earth,
and in the intermediate region of the atmosphere; each element was full of them, earth, air,
fire and water; and nothing could exist without them…As evil is everywhere present in
nature side by side with good, plagues with favorable influences, death with life, destruction
with fruitfulness; an idea of dualism as decided as in the religion of Zoroaster pervaded the
conceptions of the supernatural world formed by the Accadian magicians, the evil beings
of which they feared more than they valued the powers of good. There were essentially good
spirits, and others equally bad. These opposing troops constituted a vast dualism, which
<note type="footnote">2 Indian Wisdom, 3rd ed. (1876), p. 49.</note>

<pb n="13"/>
embraced the whole universe and kept up a perpetual struggle in all parts of the creation."3
This primitive Turanian quasi-dualism (it was not dualism in the strictest sense of the term)
was not entirely obliterated by the Cushite and Semitic civilizations and cults that successively
overlaid it. So firmly rooted had this early mode of viewing the world become that it materially
influenced the religions of the invaders rather than suffered extermination. In the
Babylonian religion of the Semitic period the dualistic element was manifest chiefly in the
magical rites of the Chaldean priests who long continued to use Accadian as their sacred
language. "Upon this dualistic conception rested the whole edifice of sacred magic, of magic
regarded as a holy and legitimate intercourse established by rites of divine origin, between
man and the supernatural beings surrounding him on all sides. Placed unhappily in the
midst of this perpetual struggle between the good and bad spirits, man felt himself attacked
by them at every moment; his fate depended upon them.…He needed then some aid against
the attacks of the bad spirits, against the plagues and diseases which they sent upon him.
This help he hoped to find in incantations, in mysterious and powerful words, the secret of
which was known only to the priests of magic, in their prescribed rites and their talismans…
The Chaldeans had such a great idea of the power and efficacy of their formulæ,
rites and amulets, that they came to regard them as required to fortify the good spirits
themselves in their combat with the demons, and as able to give them help by providing
them with invincible weapons which should ensure success."4 A large number of magical
texts have been preserved and deciphered, and among them "the ‘favorable Alad,’ the ‘favorable
Lamma,’ and the ‘favorable Utuq,’ are very frequently opposed…to the ‘evil Alad,’ the
‘evil Lamma,’ the ‘evil Utuq.’"5 It would be interesting to give in detail the results of the
researches of George Smith, Lenormant, A.H. Sayce, E. Schrader, Friedrich Delitzsch and
others, with reference to the elaborate mythological and cosmological systems of the Babylonians.
Some of the features thereof will be brought out further on by way of comparison
with the Manichæan mythology and cosmology. Suffice it to say that the dualistic element
is everywhere manifest, though not in so consistent and definite a form as in Zoroastrianism,
to say nothing of Manichæism.</p>
<p>The Medo-Persian invasion brought into Babylonia the Zoroastrian system, already
modified, no doubt, by the Elamitic (Cushite) cult. Yet the old Babylonian religion was too
firmly rooted to be supplanted, even by the religion of such conquerors as Darius and Cyrus.
Modifications, however, it undoubtedly underwent. The dualism inherent in the system
became more definite. The influence of the Jews in Mesopotamia upon the ancient population
cannot have been inconsiderable, especially as many of the former, including probably

most of the captives of the Northern tribes, were absorbed by the latter. As a result of this
blending of old Babylonian, Persian, and Hebrew blood, traditions, and religious ideas, there
was developed in Mesopotamia a type of religious thought that furnished a philosophical
basis and a mythological and cosmological garnishing for the Manichæan system. Dualism,
therefore, arising from efforts of the unaided human mind to account for the natural phenomena
that appear beneficent and malignant, partly of old Babylonian origin and partly
of Persian, but essentially modified by Hebrew influence more or less pure, furnished to
Mani the foundation of his system. We shall attempt at a later stage of the discussion to
determine more accurately the relations of Manichæism to the various systems with which
correctly or incorrectly it has been associated. Suffice it to say, at present, that no new
problem presented itself to Mani, and that he furnished no essentially new solution of the
problems that had occupied the attention of his countrymen for more than 2500 years.
Before proceeding to institute a comparison between Manichæism and the various systems
of religious thought to which it stands related, it will be advantageous to have before us an
exposition of the Manichæan system itself, based upon the most authentic sources.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Manichæan System.</head>
<p>Earlier writers on Manichæism have, for the most part, made the Acta Disp. Archelai
et Manetis and the anti-Manichæan writings of Augustin the basis of their representations.
For later Manichæism in the West, Augustin is beyond question the highest authority, and
the various polemical treatises which he put forth exhibit the system under almost every
imaginable aspect. The "Acts of the Disputation of Archelaus and Manes," while it certainly
rests upon a somewhat extensive and accurative knowledge of early Manichæism, is partially
discredited by its generally admitted spuriousness—spuriousness in the sense that it is not
a genuine record of a real debate. It is highly probable that debates of this kind occurred
between Mani and various Christian leaders in the East, and so Mani may at one time or
other have given utterance to most of the statements that are attributed to him in this writing;
or these statements may have been derived, for substance, from his numerous treatises, and
have been artfully adapted to the purposes of the writer of the "Acts." It is certain that most
of the representations are correct. But we can no longer rely upon it as an authentic firsthand
authority. Since Flügel published the treatise from the Fihrist entitled "The Doctrines
of the Manichæans, by Muhammad ben Ishâk," with a German translation and learned annotations,
it has been admitted that this treatise must be made the basis for all future representations
of Manichæism. Kessler, while he has had access to many other Oriental documents
bearing upon the subject, agrees with Flügel in giving the first place to this writing. On this
exposition of the doctrines of the Manichæans, therefore, as expounded by Flügel and
Kessler, we must chiefly rely. The highly poetical mythological form which Mani gave to
his speculations renders it exceedingly difficult to arrive at assured results with reference to
fundamental principles. If we attempt to state in a plain matter-of-fact way just what Mani
taught we are in constant danger of misrepresenting him. In fact one of the favorite methods
employed against Mani’s doctrines by the writer of the "Acts of the Disputation," etc., as
well as by Augustin and others, was to reduce Mani’s poetical fancies to plain language and
thus to show their absurdity. The considerations which have led experts like Flügel and
Kessler to put so high an estimate upon this document, and the discussions as to the original
language in which the sources of the document were written, are beyond the scope of this
essay. Suffice it to say, that so far as we are able to form a judgment on the matter, the
reasons for ascribing antiquity and authenticity to the representation of Manichæism contained
in the document are decisive.</p>
<p>1. Mani’s Life. According to the Fihrist, Mani’s father, a Persian by race, resided at
Coche on the Tigris, about forty miles north of Babylon. Afterwards he removed into
Babylonia and settled at Modein, where he frequented an idol-temple like the rest of the
people. He next became associated with a party named Mugtasila (Baptizers), probably
identical with or closely related to the Mandæans and Sabeans, both of which parties made

<pb n="16"/>
much of ceremonial bathings. Mani, who was born after the removal to Babylonia, is related
to have been the recipient of angelic visitations at the age of twelve. Even at this time he
was forewarned that he must leave the religion of his father at the age of twenty-four. At
the appointed time the angel At-Taum appeared again and announced to him his mission.
"Hail, Mani, from me and the Lord, who has sent me to thee and chosen thee for his mission.
But he commands thee to invite men to thy doctrine and to proclaim the glad tidings of
truth that comes from him, and to bestow thereon all thy zeal." Mani entered upon his
work, according to Flügel’s careful computation, April 1, 238, or, according to calculations
based on another statement, in 252. Mani maintained that he was the Paraclete promised
by Jesus. He is said, in this document, to have derived his teaching from the Magi and the
Christians, and the characters in which he wrote his books, from the Syriac and the Persian.
After travelling in many lands for forty years and disseminating his doctrines in India, China,
and Turkestan, he succeeded in impressing his views upon Fîrûz, brother of King Sapor,
who had intended to put him to death. Sapor became warmly attached to Mani and granted
toleration to his followers. Afterwards, according to some accounts, Mani was imprisoned
by Sapor and liberated by his successor Hormizd. He is said to have been crucified by order
of King Bahraîm I. (276-’7), and his skin stuffed with straw is said to have been suspended
at the city gate. Eusebius (H. E. VII. 31) describes Mani as "a barbarian in life, both in speech
and conduct, who attempted to form himself into a Christ, and then also proclaimed himself
to be the very Paraclete and the Holy Spirit. Then, as if he had been Christ, he selected
twelve disciples, the partners of his new religion, and after patching together false and ungodly
doctrines collected from a thousand heresies long since extinct, he swept them off like a
deadly poison from Persia, upon this part of the world." The account given in the Acta
Archel (written probably about 330-’40), is far more detailed than that of the Fihrist and
differs widely therefrom. It contains much that is highly improbable. Mani is represented
as having for his predecessors one Scythianus, an Egyptian heretic of Apostolic times, and
Terebinthus, who went with him to Palestine and after the death of Scythianus removed to
Babylonia. The writings of Terebinthus or Scythianus came into the possession of a certain
widow, who purchased Mani when seven years of age (then named Cubricus) and made
him heir of her property and books. He changed his name to Mani (Manes), and, having
become imbued with the teachings of the books, began at about sixty years of age to promulgate
their teachings, choosing three disciples, Thomas, Addas and Hermas, to whom he
entrusted the writings mentioned above, along with some of his own. Up to this time he
knew little of Christianity, but having been imprisoned by the king for failure in a promised
cure of the king’s son, he studied the Christian Scriptures and derived therefrom the idea
of the Paraclete, which he henceforth applied to himself. After his escape the famous dialogue
with Archelaus and that with Diodorus occurred. Returning to Arabion he was arrested,
carried to Persia, flayed alive, and his skin stuffed and suspended as above. Some additional

<pb n="17"/>
facts from an Oriental source used by Beausobre have more or less verisimilitude. According
to this, Mani was born of Magian parents about 240 A.D. He became skilled in music,
mathematics, geography, astronomy, painting, medicine, and in the Scriptures. The account
of his ascendancy over Sapor and his subsequent martyrdom is substantially the same as
that of the Fihrist. Albîrunî’s work (see bibliography preceding) confirms the account given
by the Fihrist. The conversion of Sapor to Manichæism (in A.D. 261) is said to be confirmed
by Sassanian inscriptions (see Journal of Asiat. Soc. 1868 p. 310-’41, and ibid. p. 376, and
1871 p. 416).</p>
<p>The Fihrist’s account contains a long list of the works of Mani, which is supplemented
by other Oriental and Western notices. The list is interesting as showing the wide range of
Mani’s literary activity, or at least of the literature that was afterwards connected with his
name.</p>
<p>2. Mani’s System. As the life of Mani has been the subject of diversified and contradictory
representations, so also have his doctrines. Here, too, we must make the account given
by the Fihrist fundamental. It will be convenient to treat the subject under the following
heads: Theology, Cosmogony, Anthropology, Soteriology, Cultus, Eschatology, and Ethics.</p>
<p>(1.) Theology. Mani taught dualism in the most unqualified sense. Zoroastrianism is
commonly characterized as dualistic, yet it is so in no such sense as is Manichæism. According
to the Fihrist, "Mani teaches: Two subsistences form the beginning of the world, the
one light the other darkness; the two are separated from each other. The light is the first
most glorious being, limited by no number, God himself, the King of the Paradise of Light.
He has five members: meekness, knowledge, understanding, mystery, insight; and five
other spiritual members: love, faith, truth, nobleness, and wisdom. He maintained furthermore
that the God of light, with these his attributes, is without beginning, but with him two
equally eternal things likewise exist, the one the atmosphere, the other the earth. Mani
adds: and the members of the atmosphere are five [the first series of divine attributes
mentioned above are enumerated]; and the members of the earth are five [the second series].
The other being is the darkness, and his members are five: cloud, burning, hot wind, poison,
and darkness. Mani teaches: that the light subsistence borders immediately on the dark
subsistence, without a dividing wall between them; the light touches with its (lowest) side
the darkness, while upwards to the right and left it is unbounded. Even so the darkness is
endless downwards and to the right and left."</p>
<p>This represents Mani’s view of the eternally existent status quo, before the conflict began,
and the endless state after the conflict ceases. What does Mani mean, when he enumerates
two series of five attributes each as members of God, and straightway postulates the coeternity
of atmosphere and earth and divides these self-same attributes between the latter?
Doubtless Mani’s theology was fundamentally pantheistic, i.e., pantheistic within the limits
of each member of the dualism. The God of Light himself is apparently conceived of as

<pb n="18"/>
transcending thought. Atmosphere and Earth (not the atmosphere and earth that we know,
but ideal atmosphere and earth) are the æons derived immediately from the Ineffable One
and coëternal with him. The ten attributes are æons which all belong primarily to the Supreme
Being and secondarily to the two great æons, half to each. The question may arise,
and has been often discussed, whether Mani meant to identify God (the Prince of Light)
with the Kingdom of Light? His language, in this treatise, is wavering. He seems to struggle
against such a representation, yet without complete success.</p>
<p>What do the other sources teach with reference to the absoluteness of the dualism and
with reference to the identification of the Prince of Light with the Kingdom of Light? According
to the Acts of the Disputation of Archelaus and Manes,6Manes "worships two deities,
unoriginated, self-existent, eternal, opposed the one to the other. Of them he represents
the one as good, and the other as evil, and assigned the name of Light to the former, and
that of Darkness to the latter." Again, Manes is represented as saying: "I hold that there are
two natures, one good and another evil; and that the one which is good dwells in a certain
part proper to it, but that the evil one is this world as well as all things in it, which are placed
there like objects imprisoned in the portion of the wicked one" (1 John 5, 19). According
to Alexander of Lycopolis,7 "Mani laid down two principles, God and matter (Hyle). God
he called good, and matter he affirmed to be evil. But God excelled more in good than
matter in evil." Alexander goes on to show how Mani used the word Hyle, comparing the
Manichæan with the Platonic teaching. Statements of substantially the same purport might
be multiplied. As regards the identification of God (the King of Light) with the Kingdom
of Light, and of Satan (the King of Darkness) with the Kingdom of Darkness, the sensuous
poetical way in which Mani expressed his doctrines may leave us in doubt. The probability
is, however, that he did pantheistically identify each element of the dualism with his Kingdom.
He personifies the Kingdom of Light and the Kingdom of Darkness, and peoples these
Kingdoms with fanciful beings, which are to be regarded as personified attributes of the
principles of darkness and light.</p>
<p>A word on the Manichæan conception of matter or Hyle may not be out of place in this
connection. It would seem that the Manichæans practically identified Hyle or matter with
the Kingdom of Darkness. At any rate Hyle is unoriginated and belongs wholly to this
Kingdom.</p>
<p>(2.) Cosmogony. So much for the Manichæan idea of the Kingdom of Light and the
Kingdom of Darkness before the great conflict that resulted in the present order of things.
Why did not they remain separate? Let us learn from the Fihrist’s narrative: "Mani teaches
further: Out of this dark earth [the Kingdom of Darkness] arose Satan, not that he was in
<note type="footnote">6 Ante-Nicene Library, Am. ed. vol. vi. pp. 182 and 188.</note>
<note type="footnote">7 Ibid. p. 241.</note>

<pb n="19"/>
himself eternal from the beginning, yet were his substances in his elements unoriginated.
These substances now united themselves out of his elements and went forth as Satan, his
head as the head of a lion, his body as the body of a dragon, his wings as the wings of a bird,
his tail as the tail of a great fish, and his four feet as the feet of creeping animals. When this
Satan under the name Iblis, the (temporally considered) eternal (primeval), had arisen out
of the darkness, he devoured and consumed everything, spread destruction right and left,
and plunged into the deep, in all these movements bringing down from above desolation
and annihilation. Then he strove for the height, and descried the beams of light; but they
were opposed to him. When he saw later how exalted these were, he was terrified, shrivelled
up, and merged himself in his elements. Hereupon he strove anew with such violence after
the height, that the land of light descried the doings of Satan and how he was bent upon
murder and destruction. After they had been apprised thereof, the world of Insight learned
of it, then the world of Knowledge, then the world of Mystery, then the world of Understanding,
then the world of Meekness. When at last, he further teaches, the King of the Paradise
of Light had also learned of it, he thought how he might suppress Satan, and, Mani adds,
those hosts of his would have been mighty enough to overpower Satan. Yet he desired to
do this by means of his own might. Accordingly, he produced by means of the spirit of his
right hand <del>i.e., the Gentle Breeze</del>, his five worlds, and his twelve elements, a creature, and
this is the (temporally considered) Eternal Man <del>Primordial Man</del>, and summoned him to
do battle with the Darkness. But Primordial Man, Mani adds, armed himself with the five
races <del>natures</del>, and these are the five gods, the Gentle Breeze, the Wind, the Light, the
Water and the Fire. Of them he made his armor, and the first that he put on was the Gentle
Breeze. He then covered the Gentle Breeze with the burning Light as with a mantle. He
drew over the Light Water filled with atoms, and covered himself with the blowing Wind.
Hereupon he took the Fire as a shield and as a lance in his hand, and precipitated himself
suddenly out of Paradise until he reached the border of the region that is contiguous to the
battle-field. The Primordial Devil also took his five races <del>natures</del>: Smoke, Burning,
Darkness, Hot Wind and Cloud; armed himself with them; made of them a shield for himself;
and went to meet Primordial Man. After they had fought for a long time the Primordial
Devil vanquished the Primordial Man, devoured some of his light, and surrounded him at
the same time with his races and elements. Then the King of the Paradise of Light sent
other gods, freed him, and vanquished the Darkness. But he who was sent by the King of
Light to rescue Primordial Man is called the Friend of the Light. This one made a precipitate
descent, and Primordial Man was freed from the hellish substances, along with that which
he had snatched from the spirit of Darkness and which had adhered to him. When, therefore,
Mani proceeds, Joyfulness and the Spirit of Life drew near to the border, they looked down
into the abyss of this deep hell and saw Primordial Man and the angels <del>i.e., the races or
natures with which he was armed</del>, how Iblis, the Proud Oppressors, and the Dark Life

<pb n="20"/>
surrounded them. And the Spirit of Life, says Mani, called Primordial Man with a loud
voice as quick as lightning and Primordial Man became another god. When the Primordial
Devil had ensnared Primordial Man in the battle, Mani further teaches, the five parts of the
Light were mingled with the five parts of the Darkness."</p>
<p>Let us see if we can get at the meaning of this great cosmological poem as far as we have
gone. The thing to be accounted for is the mixture of good and evil. The complete separation
of the eternally existent Kingdoms of Light and Darkness has been posited. How now are
we to account for the mixture of light and darkness, of good and evil, in the present order
of things? Mani would account for it by supposing that a conflict had occurred between an
insufficiently equipped representative of the King of Light and the fully equipped ruler of
the Kingdom of Darkness. His view of the vastly superior power of the King of Light would
not allow him to suppose that the King of Light fully equipped had personally contended
with the King of Darkness, and suffered the loss and contamination of his elements. Yet he
only clumsily obviates this difficulty; for Primordial Man is produced and equipped by the
King of Light for the very purpose of combating the King of Darkness, and Mani saves the
King of Light from personal contamination only by impugning his judgment.</p>
<p>We have now reached the point where, as a result of the conflict, good and evil are
blended. We must beware of supposing that Mani meant to ascribe any kind of materiality
to the members of the Kingdom of Light. The Kingdom of Light, on the contrary, he regarded
as purely spiritual; the Kingdom of Darkness as material. We have now the conditions for
the creation of the present order of things, including man. How does Mani picture the
process and the results of this mixing of the elements?</p>
<p>"The smoke (or vapor) was mingled with the gentle breeze (zephyr), and the present
atmosphere resulted. So that whatever of agreeableness and power to quicken the soul and
animal life is found in it <del>resultant air</del>, is from the zephyr, and whatever of destructiveness
and noisomeness is found in it, proceeds from the smoke. The burning was mingled with
the fire; therefore whatever of conflagration, destruction and ruin is found, is from the
burning, but whatever of brightness and illumination is in it <del>the resultant fire</del>, springs
from the fire. The light mingled itself with the darkness; therefore in dense bodies as gold,
silver and the like, whatever of brightness, beauty, purity and other useful qualities occurs,
is from the light, and whatever of tarnish, impurity, density and hardness occurs, springs
from the darkness. The hot wind was mingled with the wind; whatever now is useful and
agreeable in this <del>resultant wind</del> springs from the wind, and whatever of uneasiness, hurtfulness
and deleterious property is found in it <del>resultant wind</del> is from the hot wind. Finally,
the mist was mingled with the water, so that what is found in this <del>resultant water</del> of
clearness, sweetness, and soul-satisfying property, is from the water; whatever, on the contrary,
of overwhelming, suffocating, and destroying power, of heaviness, and corruption, is
found in it, springs from the mist."</p>

<pb n="21"/>
<p>But we must from this point abbreviate the somewhat prolix account. Primordial Man,
after the blending of the elements, ascended on high accompanied by "one of the angels of
this intermingling;" in other words, snatching away a part of the imprisoned elements of
the Kingdom of Light.</p>
<p>The next step is the creation of the present world, which Mani ascribes to the King of
the World of Light, the object being to provide for the escape of the imprisoned elements
of Light. Through an angel he constructed ten heavens and eight earths, an angel being
appointed to hold heavens and earths in their places. A description of the stairways, doors,
and halls of the heavens is given in the Fihrist’s narrative. The stairways lead to the "height
of heaven." The air was used as a medium for connecting heaven and earth. A pit was
formed to be the receptacle of darkness from which the light should be liberated. The sun
and the moon were created to be the receptacles of the light that should be liberated from
the darkness, the sun for light that has been mingled with "hot devils," the moon for that
which had been mingled with "cold devils." The moon is represented as collecting light
during the first half-month, and during the second pouring it into the sun. When the sun
and moon have liberated all the light they are able, there will be a fire kindled on the earth
which will burn for 1468 years, when there will be no light left. The King of Darkness and
his hosts will thereupon withdraw into the pit prepared for them.</p>
<p>(3.) Anthropology. So much for the liberation of the imprisoned light, which, according
to Mani, was the sole object of creation. As yet we have heard nothing of the creation of
living creatures. What place do man, the lower animals, and plants sustain in the Manichæan
economy? We are to keep constantly in mind that Primordial Man was not Adam, but a
divine æon, and that he ascended into the heights immediately after the blending of parts
of his armor with darkness. The creation of earthly man was an altogether different affair.
We must give the account of man’s creation in Mani’s own words, as preserved by the
Fihrist: "Hereupon one of those Arch-fiends and <del>one</del> of the Stars, and Overmastering
Violence, Avarice, Lust, and Sin, copulated, and from their copulation sprang the first man,
who is Adam, two Arch-fiends, a male and a female, directing the process. A second copulation
followed and from this sprang the beautiful woman who is Eve."</p>
<p>Man, therefore, unlike the world, is the creature of demons, the aim of the demons being
to imprison in man, through the propagation of the race, as much as possible of the light,
and so to hinder the separating process by the sun and the moon. Avarice is represented
as having secretly seized some of the divine light and imprisoned it in man. The part played
by the Star in the production of man is somewhat obscure in the narrative, yet the Star could
hardly have been regarded as wholly evil. Probably the Star was thought of as a detached
portion of the light that had not entered into the sun or the moon. "When, therefore, the
five Angels saw what had taken place, they besought the Messenger of Joyful Knowledge,
the Mother of Life, Primordial Man and the Spirit of Life, to send some one to liberate and

<pb n="22"/>
save man, to reveal to him knowledge and righteousness, and to free him from the power
of the devils. They sent, accordingly, Jesus, whom a god accompanied. These seized the
two Arch-fiends, imprisoned them and freed the two creatures (Adam and Eve.)"</p>
<p>Jesus warned Adam of Eve’s violent importunity, and Adam obeyed his injunction not
to go near her. One of the Arch-fiends, however, begat with her a son named Cain, who in
turn begat Abel of his mother, and afterwards two maidens Worldly wise and Daughter-of-
Avarice. Cain took the first to wife and gave the other to Abel. An angel having begotten
of Worldly-wise two beautiful daughters (Raufarjâd and Barfarjâd), Abel accused Cain of
the act. Cain enraged by the false accusation slew Abel and took Worldly-wise to wife. So
far Adam had kept himself pure, but Eve was instructed by a demon in the art of enchanting,
and she was enabled to excite his lust and to entrap him. By Adam she bore a beautiful son,
whom the demon urged Eve to destroy. Adam stole the child away and brought it up on
cow’s milk and fruit. This son was named Seth (Schatil). Adam once more yielded to Eve’s
fascinations, but through Seth’s exhortations was induced to flee "eastward to the light and
the wisdom of God." Adam, Seth, Raufarjâd, Barfarjâd, and Worldly-wise died and went
to Paradise; while Eve, Cain, and Daughter-of-Avarice went into Hell. This fantastic perversion
of the Biblical narrative of the creation and fall of man has many parallels in Rabbinic
literature, and doubtless Mani first became acquainted with the narrative in a corrupted
form. The teaching, however, of this mythologizing evidently is that the indulgence of the
flesh and the begetting of children furnish the chief obstacle to the separation of light from
darkness. Adam is represented as striving to escape from the allurements of Eve, but Eve
is aided by demonic craft in overcoming him. Yet Adam does not become enslaved to lust,
and so at last is saved. Eve, lustful from the beginning, is lost along with those of like disposition.</p>
<p>(4.) Soteriology. Such was, apparently, Mani’s conception of the creation of man, and
of the attempts to liberate the light that was in him. What were his practical teachings to
men of his time as to the means of escape from the Kingdom of Darkness into the Kingdom
of Light? What view did Mani take of the historical Jesus? The Jesus who warned Adam
against the seductions of Eve was evidently not the Jesus of the New Testament. According
to the narrative of the Fihrist, Mani "maintained that Jesus is a devil." Such a statement occurs
nowhere else, so far as we are aware, in the literature of Manichæism. The sources, however,
are unanimous in ascribing to Mani a completely docetical view of the person of Christ. In
using this blasphemous language, he probably referred to the representations of Jesus as
God manifest in the flesh, which he regarded as Jewish and abominable. The New Testament
narratives Mani <del>or at least his followers</del> regarded as interpolated in the interest of Judaism.
Later Manichæans, under the influence of Marcionism (and orthodoxy) gave to Jesus a far
more prominent place in the economy of man’s salvation than did Mani himself.</p>


<pb n="23"/>
<p>How then is man to be saved according to Mani? It is by rigorous asceticism, and by
the practice of certain ceremonial observances. Mani does not rise above the plane of ordinary
heathenism in his plan of salvation. "It is incumbent upon him who will enter into the
religion that he prove himself, and that if he sees that he is able to subdue lust and avarice,
to leave off the eating of all kinds of flesh, the drinking of wine, and connubial intercourse,
and to withhold himself from what is injurious in water, fire, magic and hypocrisy, he may
enter into the religion; but if not let him abstain from entering. But if he loves religion, yet
is not able to repress sensuality and avarice, yet he may make himself serviceable for the
maintenance of religion and of the Truthful <del>i.e. the ‘Elect’</del>, and may meet (offset) his corrupt
deeds through the use of opportunities where he wholly gives himself up to activity, right-
eousness, zealous watchfulness, prayer and pious humiliation; for this suffices him in this
transitory world and in the future eternal world, and his form in the last day will be the
second form, of which, God willing, we shall treat further below."</p>
<p>The doctrine of indulgences of which the germs appeared in the Catholic church even
before the time of Mani, is here seen fully developed. What the Greek and Latin sources
call the Elect or Perfect and the Hearers, are undoubtedly indicated here by those who are
able to devote themselves to rigidly ascetical living, and those who, without such qualifications,
are willing to exert themselves fully on behalf of the cause. These latter evidently become
partakers of the merits of those who carry out the ascetical regulations. That this is
primitive Manichæan doctrine is abundantly proved by the general agreement of ancient
writers of all classes. It is noteworthy that nothing Christian appears among the conditions
of Manichæan discipleship. It is not faith in Christ, but the ability to follow a particular
kind of outward life that confers standing in the Manichæan society.</p>
<p>(5.) Cultus. Let us next look at the precepts of Mani to the initiated: "Mani imposed
upon his disciples commandments, namely, ten commandments, and to these are attached
three seals, and fasts of seven days in each month. The commandments are: Faith in the
four most glorious essences: God, his Light, his Power, and his Wisdom. But God, whose
name is glorious, is the King of the Paradise of Light; his Light is the sun and the moon, his
Power the five angels: Gentle Breeze, Wind, Light, Water and Fire; and his Wisdom the
Sacred Religion. This embraces five ideas: that of teachers, the sons of Meekness; that of
those enlightened by the Sun, sons of Knowledge; that of the presbyters, sons of Reason;
that of the Truthful, sons of Mystery; that of Hearers, sons of Insight. The ten commandments
are: Abandoning of prayer to idols, of lies, avarice, murder, adultery, theft, of the
teaching of jugglery and magic, of duplicity of mind, which betrays doubt on religion, of
drowsiness and inertness in business; and the commandment of four or seven prayers. In
prayer one is to stand upright, rub himself with flowing water or with something else, and
turn while standing to the great light (the Sun), then prostrate himself and in this position
pray: Blessed be our Leader, the Paraclete, the Ambassador of the Light, blessed be his angels,

<pb n="24"/>
the Guardians, and highly praised be his resplendent hosts.… In the second prostration let
him say: Thou highly praised, O thou enlightening one, Mani, our Leader, thou root of
enlightenment, stem of honorableness, thou great tree who art altogether the means of salvation.
In the third prostration let him say: I fall down and praise with pure heart and upright
tongue the great God, the Father of Light, and their element, highly praised, Blessed
One, thou and thy whole glory and thy blessed world, which thou hast called into being.
For he praises thee who praises thy Host, thy Righteous Ones, thy Word, thy Glory, and thy
Good Pleasure, because thou art the God who is wholly truth, life and righteousness. In the
fourth prostration let him say: I praise and fall down before all the gods, all the enlightening
angels, before all Light and all Hosts, who are from the great God. In the fifth prostration
let him say: I fall down and praise the great Host and the enlightening Gods, who with their
wisdom assail the Darkness, drive it out and triumph over it. In the sixth prostration let
him say: I fall down and praise the Father of Glory, the Exalted One, the Enlightening One,
who has come forth from the two sciences (see note in Flügel p. 310), and so on to the twelfth
prostration. * * The first prayer is accomplished at mid-day, the second between this hour
and sunset; then follows the prayer at eventide, after sunset, and hereupon the prayer in the
first quarter of the night, three hours after sunset.</p>
<p>"As regards fasting, when the sun is in Sagittarius, and the moon has its full light, fasting
is to take place for two days without interruption, also when the new moon begins to appear;
likewise when the moon first becomes visible again after the sun has entered into the sign
of Capricorn; then when the new moon begins to appear, the sun stands in Aquarius and
from the moon eight days have flowed, a fast of thirty days occurs, broken, however, daily
at sunset. The common Manichæans celebrate Sunday, the consecrated ones (the ‘Elect’)
Monday."</p>
<p>Here we have a somewhat detailed account of the cultus of the early Manichæans. The
forms of invocation do not differ materially from those of the Zoroastrians, of the early Indians,
of the Babylonians, and of the Egyptians. There is not the slightest evidence of
Christian influence. The times of worship and of fasting are determined by the sun and the
moon, and practically these are the principal objects of worship. It is certain that Mani
himself was regarded by his followers as the most perfect revealer of God that had ever appeared
among men, and, according to this account, he taught his followers to worship him.
We cannot fail to see in this Manichæan cult the old Oriental pantheism modified by a dualism,
of which the most fully developed form was the Persian, but which, as we have seen,
was by no means confined to Zoroastrianism.</p>
<p>(6.) Eschatology. We must conclude our exposition of the doctrines of the Manichæans
by quoting from the Fihrist Mani’s teachings on eschatology.</p>
<p>"When death approaches a Truthful One (‘Elect’), teaches Mani, Primordial Man sends
a Light-God in the form of a guiding Wise One, and with him three gods, and along with

<pb n="25"/>
these the water-vessel, clothing, head-gear, crown, and garland of light. With them comes
the maiden, like the soul of this Truthful One. There appears to him also the devil of avarice
and lust, along with other devils. As soon as the Truthful Man sees these he calls the goddess
who has assumed the form of the Wise One and the three other gods to his help, and they
draw near him. As soon as the devils are aware of their presence they turn and flee. The
former, however, take this Truthful One, clothe him with the crown, the garland and the
robe, put the water-vessel in his hand and mount with him upon the pillars of promise to
the sphere of the moon, to Primordial Man, and to Nahnaha, the Mother of the Living, to
the position in which he was at first in the Paradise of Light. But his body remains lying as
before in order that the sun, the moon, and the gods of Light may withdraw from it the
powers, i.e., the water, the fire and the gentle breeze, and he rises to the sun and becomes a
god. But the rest of his body, which is wholly darkness, is cast into hell."</p>
<p>In the case of Manichæans of the lower order, described above, the same divine personages
appear at his summons. "They free him also from devils, but he ceases not to be like a
man in the world, who in his dreams sees frightful forms and sinks into filth and mire. In
this condition he remains, until his light and his spirit are liberated and he has attained to
the place of union with the Truthful, and after a long period of wandering to and fro puts
on their garments."</p>
<p>To the sinful man, on the other hand, the divine personages appear, not to free him
from the devils that are tormenting him, but rather to "overwhelm him with reproaches, to
remind him of his deeds, and strikingly to convince him that he has renounced help for
himself, from the side of the Truthful. Then wanders he round about in the world, unceasingly
chased by torments, until this order of things ceases, and along with the world he is
cast into hell."</p>
<p>There is nothing original about the eschatology of Mani, and scarcely anything Christian.
We see in it a fully developed doctrine of purgatory, somewhat like the Platonic, and still
more like that of the later Catholic church. Salvation consists simply in the liberation of
the light from the darkness. In the case of the Elect this takes place immediately after death;
in the case of adherents who have not practiced the prescribed forms of asceticism, it takes
place only after considerable torment. In the case of the ordinary sensual man, there is no
deliverance. Doubtless Mani would have held that in his case, too, whatever particles of
light may have been involved in his animal structure are liberated from the dead body.</p>
<p>(7.) Ethics. As regards ceremonies we find little that enlightens us in the Fihrist’s account.
Water (that is, water apart from the deleterious elements that have become blended
with it) was regarded by Mani as one of the divine elements. The ablutions in running water
mentioned above in connection with the prayers may have sustained some relation to baptism,
but can hardly be ascribed to Christian influence. The connection of the Manichæans
with the Mandæans, who made much of ceremonial bathing, will be considered below. It

<pb n="26"/>
is certain that Mani’s father was connected with a baptizing party, viz., the Mugtasilah.
According to the Fihrist Mani was the author of an Epistle on Baptism. The question
whether Mani and his followers practised water-baptism or not is by no means an easy one
to solve. The passage cited by Giesseler from Augustin to prove that the "Elect" were initiated
by baptism is inconclusive. Augustin acknowledges that God and the Manichæans themselves
alone know what takes place in the secret meetings of the "Elect." Whatever ceremonies
they performed, whether baptism or the Lord’s supper, or some other, were matters of
profound secrecy, and so we need not wonder at the lack of definite information. From a
passage quoted by Augustin in his report of a discussion with Felix the Manichæan, we
should certainly infer that both ordinances were practised in some form by the Manichæans
of the West. But Augustin himself says that Manichæans deny the saving efficacy of baptism,
maintain that it is superfluous, do not require it of those whom they win to their views, etc.
It is certain, therefore, that if they practised baptism and the Lord’s supper at all, they attached
to it a meaning radically different from that of Augustin. It is possible that a ceremonial
anointing with oil took the place of baptism. (Baur, p. 277 sq.). Augustin mentions a disgusting
ceremony in which human semen was partaken of by the Elect in order to deliver
the imprisoned light contained therein (De Haeres. 46), and he calls this ceremony a sort
of Eucharist. But his confessed ignorance of the doings of the "Elect" discredits in some
measure this accusation.</p>
<p>The Fihrist gives us no definite information about the three signacula. The seals (not
signs) of the mouth, the hand (or hands), and of the bosom. In these are contained symbolically
the Manichæan moral system. In the book Sadder (Hyde, p. 492) we read: "It is taught
<del>by the Manichæans</del> to abstain from every sin, to eliminate every sin from hand, and tongue
and thought." Augustin explains the signacula more fully and represents the Manichæans
as attaching great importance to them: "When I name the mouth, I mean all the senses that
are in the head; when I name the hand I mean every operation; when I name the bosom I
mean every seminal lust."</p>
<p>It is confidently believed that the foregoing account of the Manichæan system, based
upon the Arabic narratives preserved by the Fihrist, supplemented by the principal Eastern
and Western sources, contains the essential facts with reference to this strange system of
religious thought. Our next task will to be to ascertain, as precisely as possible, the relations
that Manichæism sustained to the various religious systems with which it has commonly
been associated.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Relation of Manichæism to Zoroastrianism.</head>
<p>The very close connection of these two systems has commonly been presupposed, and
is undeniable. In fact Manichæism has frequently been represented as Zoroastrian dualism,
slightly modified by contact with Christianity and other systems. No one could possibly
gain even a superficial view of the two systems without being strongly impressed with their
points of resemblance. A closer examination, however, will reveal points of antagonism
just as striking, and will enable us to account for the fact that Mani was put to death by a
zealous Zoroastrian ruler on account of his recognized hostility to the state religion. The
leading features of the Manichæan system are already before us. Instead of quoting at length
from the Zend-Avesta, which is now happily accessible in an excellent English translation,
we may for the sake of brevity quote Tiele’s description of Zoroastrian dualism as a basis of
comparison:8</p>
<p>"Parsism is decidedly dualistic, not in the sense of accepting two hostile deities, for it
recognizes no worship of evil beings, and teaches the adoration only of Ahura Mazda and
the spirits subject to him; but in the sense of placing in hostility to each other two sharply
divided kingdoms, that of light, of truth, and of purity, and that of darkness, of falsehood,
and of impurity. This division is carried through the whole creation, organic and inorganic,
material and spiritual. Above, in the highest sphere, is the domain of the undisputed sovereignty
of the All-wise God; beneath, in the lowest abyss, the kingdom of his mighty adversary;
midway between the two lies this world, the theatre of the contest.… This dualism further
dominates the cosmogony, the cultus, and the entire view of the moral order of the world
held by the Mazda worshippers. Not only does Anro-Maînyus (Ahriman) spoil by his
counter-creations all the good creations of Ahura-Mazda (Ormuzd), but by slaying the
protoplasts of man and beast, he brings death into the world, seduces the first pair to sin,
and also brings forth noxious animals and plants. Man finds himself, in consequence, surrounded
on all sides by the works of the spirits of darkness and by his hosts. It is the object
of worship to secure the pious against their influence."</p>
<p>Let us bring in review some of the points of resemblance between the two systems. Both
are in a sense dualistic. In both the kingdoms of Light and Darkness are set over against
each other in the sharpest antagonism. In both we have similar emanations from these
kingdoms (or kings). Yet, while in the Manichæan system the dualism is absolute and
eternal, in the later Zoroastrian system (as in the Jewish and Christian doctrine of Satan),
<note type="footnote">8 Outlines of the Hist. of Religion (1877), p. 173. Cf. J. Darmsteter, Introduction to the Zend-Avesta, p. xliii.,
xliv., lvi., lxxii., lxxiv. sq.; and his article in the Contemporary Review (Oct. 1879), on "The Supreme God in the
Indo-European Mythology."</note>

<pb n="28"/>
Ahriman (Satan) if not merely a fallen creature9 of Ormuzd (the good and supreme God)
was at least an immeasurably inferior being. The supreme control of the universe, to which
it owes its perfect order, was ascribed by Zoroastrianism to Ormuzd. The struggle between
good and evil, beneficent and malevolent, was due to the opposition of the mighty, but not
almighty, Ahriman. Whatever form of Mazdeism (Zoroastrianism) we take for purposes
of comparison, we are safe in saying that the Manichæan dualism was by far the more absolute.</p>
<p>In both systems each side of the dualism is represented by a series (or rather several
series) of personified principles. These agree in the two systems in some particulars. Yet
the variations are quite as noticeable as the agreements. There is much in common between
the Manichæan and the Zoroastrian delineations of the fearful conflict between the Kingdom
of Light and the Kingdom of Darkness, yet the beginning of the conflict is quite differently
conceived of in the two systems. In Manichæism the creation is accounted for by the conflict
in which Primordial Man was beaten by the powers of Darkness and suffered the mixing of
his elements with the elements of darkness. The actual world was made by the good God,
or rather by his subordinates, as a means of liberating the imprisoned light. The creation of
man is ascribed, on the other hand, to the King of Darkness (or his subordinates), with a
view to hindering the escape of the mingled light by diffusion thereof through propagation.
Mazdeism derives the creation solely from Ormuzd, from whose hand it issued "as pure and
perfect as himself" (Lenormant, Anc. Hist. II. p. 30). It was the work of Ahriman to "spoil
it by his evil influence." The appellation "Maker of the material world" is constantly applied
to Ormuzd in the Vendîdâd and other sacred books. The most instructive Mazdean account
of the creation that has come down to us is that contained in the Vendîdâd, Fargard I. Ahura
Mazda (Ormuzd) is represented here as naming one by one the sixteen good lands that he
had created. Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) is represented as coming to each, one by one, and
creating in it noxious things. Examples of these counter-creations are, the serpents, winter,
venomous flies, sinful lusts, mosquitoes, pride, unnatural sin, burying the dead, witchcraft,
the sin of unbelief, the burning of corpses, abnormal issues in women, oppression of foreign
<note type="footnote">9 This is confidently asserted by Kessler (Art. Mani in Herzog’s RE, 2d ed. vol. IX. p. 258), and after him by
Harnack, Encyclopædia Britannica, art. Manichæism. On the other hand, Lenormant (Anc. Hist. II. p. 30), says:
"Ahriman had been eternal in the past, he had no beginning, and proceeded from no former being * * * . This
being who had no beginning would come to an end. * * * . Evil then should be finally conquered and destroyed,
the creation should become as pure as on its first day, and Ahriman should disappear forever." Such, doubtless,
was the original doctrine, but the form probably in vogue in the time of Mani was more pantheistic or monotheistic,
both Ormuzd and Ahriman proceeding from boundless time (Zrvan akarana). See on this matter,

Hist. as above.</note>

<pb n="29"/>
rulers, excessive heat, etc. This jumble of physical evils and sins is characteristic of Mazdeism.</p>
<p>According to Mani matter is inherently evil, and it only ceases to be absolutely evil by
the mixture with it of the elements of the Kingdom of Light. Creation is a process forced
upon the King of Light by the ravages of the King of Darkness, and is at best only partially
good. Zoroastrianism looked upon earth, fire, water, as sacred elements, to defile which
was sin of the most heinous kind. Manichæism regarded actual fire and water as made up
of a mixture of elements of light and darkness, and so, as by no means wholly pure.
Manichæans regarded earth, so far as it consisted of dead matter, with the utmost contempt.
The life-giving light in it was alone thought of with respect. Zoroastrianism somewhat arbitrarily
divided animals and plants between the kingdoms of Ormuzd and Ahriman; but
the idea that all material things, so far as they are material, are evil, seems never to have occurred
to the early Mazdeists. Manichæans agreed with Mazdeists in their veneration for
the sun, but the principles underlying this veneration seem to have been widely different in
the two cases. The most radical opposition of the two systems is seen in their views of human
propagation. Mani regarded the procreation of children as ministering directly to the designs
of the King of Darkness to imprison the light, and so absolutely condemned it. The Zend-
Avesta says: (Vendîdâd, Fargard IV.): "Verily I say unto thee, O Spitama Zarathustra; the
man who has a wife is far above him who begets no sons; he who keeps a house is far above
him who has none; he who has children is far above a childless man." Mani made great
merit of voluntary poverty. The Zend-Avesta (ibid.) says: "He who has riches is far above
him who has none." Mani forbade the use of animal food as preventing the escape of the
light contained in the bodies of animals. The Zend-Avesta (ibid.): "And of two men, he
who fills himself with meat is filled with the good spirit much more than he who does not
do so; the latter is all but dead; the former is above him by the worth of an Asperena, by the
worth of a sheep, by the worth of an ox, by the worth of a man."10</p>
<p>The eschatology of the two systems might be shown to present just as striking contrasts,
and just as marked resemblances. In both systems the consummation of the age is effected
by means of a conflagration, the aim of the conflagration in Mazdeism being the punishment
and the purging of wicked men, the destruction of wicked spirits, the renovation of the
earth, and the inauguration of the sole sovereignty of Ormuzd, while in Manichæism the
aim of the conflagration is to liberate the portions of light which the processes of animal
and vegetable growth, with the aid of sun and the moon have proved unable to liberate.</p>
<p>But enough has been said to make it evident that Manichæism was by no means a slightly
altered edition of Zoroastrianism. The points of similarity between the two are certainly
more apparent than real, though the historical relationship can by no means be denied.</p>
<note type="footnote">10 That meat is used in the sense of flesh may be inferred from Darmsteter’s comment on this passage, which
he suggests may be a bit of religious polemics against Manichæism. See his Introd. to the Zend-Avesta, p. xl. sq.</note>

<head>Chapter V.—The Relation of Manichæism to the Old Babylonian
Religion as Seen in Mandæism and Sabeanism.</head>
<p>It would have been strange indeed if the old Babylonian religion, after dominating the
minds of the inhabitants of Mesopotamia for so many centuries, had given place completely
to the religion of the Medo-Persian conquerors of the country. Magism itself was a mixture
of old Babylonian, Medic and Persian elements. But there is much reason for believing that
the primitive Babylonian faith, in a more or less pure form, persisted until long after the
time of Mani, nay, that it has maintained its ground even till the present day. The researches
of Chwolson, Nöldeke, Kessler and others, in the literature and history of the Mandæans
and the Sabeans, combined in the last case at least with accurate knowledge of old Babylonian
literature and religion, have rendered it highly probable that representatives of the old
Babylonian faith were numerous in Mesopotomia and the adjoining regions at the time of
Mani, and that Mani himself was more or less closely connected with it. The Mandæans
were a Gnostic sect of the Ophitic type, without Christian elements. It is the opinion of
Kessler, who has devoted much attention to this sect and to the relations of occult religious
matters in general in Mesopotomia, that "the source of all Gnosis, and especially the immediate
source of Ophitic Gnosis, is not the doctrine of the Persian Zoroaster, not Phoenicean
heathenism, not the theory and practise of Greek mysteries, but the old Babylonian-
Chaldaic national religion, which maintained itself in Mesopotomia and Babylonia, the
abode of the Ophites, Perates, Mandæans, until the post-Christian centuries, and was now
opposed by the Gentiles in a mystical-ascetical form to Christianity." The close connection
of the Mandæans with the Ophites, and of both with the old Babylonian religion, would
seem to be established beyond question. The relation of Manichæism to Mandæism has
been by no means so clearly shown. Let us look at some of the supposed points of contact.
Mani’s connection with the Mugtasilah sect (or Baptizers) has already been mentioned.
Kessler seeks to identify this party with the Mandæans, or at least to establish a community
of origin and of fundamental principles in the two parties. He would connect with the old
Babylonian sect, of which ceremonial baptism seems to have been a common characteristic,
the Palestinian Hemero-baptists, Elkesaites, Nazareans, Ebionites, etc. There is nothing
improbable about this supposition. Certainly we find elements in Palestinian heresy during
the early Christian centuries, which we can hardly suppose to have been indigenous. And
there is no more likely source of occult religious influence than Babylonia, unless it be Egypt,
and there is much reason for supposing that even in Alexandria Babylonian influences were
active before and after the beginning of the Christian era. Besides, a large number of Gnostic
elements different from these can be traced to Egypt. How far the Mandæans of modern
times, and as they are described in extant literature, correspond with representatives of the
old Babylonian religion in the third century, cannot be determined with complete certainty.

<pb n="31"/>
Yet there is much about this party that has a primitive appearance, and the tenacity with
which it has held aloof from Judaism, Manichæism, Mohammedanism, and Oriental
Christianity, during centuries of conflict and oppression, says much for its conservatism.
It would extend this chapter unduly to describe the elaborate cosmogony, mythology, hierarchy,
ceremonial, etc., of this interesting party. For the illustration of Christian Gnosticism
the facts that have been brought out are of the utmost value. As compared with Manichæism,
there is a remarkable parallelism between the two kingdoms and their subordinates or æons;
the conflict between Primordial Man and the King of Darkness has its counterpart in
Mandæism. The close connection of the Mandæan and the Manichæan cosmogony, together
with similar views about water in the two parties, would make it highly probable that the
Manichæans, like the Mandæans, practised some kind of ceremonial ablutions.</p>
<p>What, now, are the grounds on which the connection of these systems with the old
Babylonian religion is based? The dualistic element in the old Babylonian system was
pointed out above. Kessler seeks to establish an almost complete parallelism between the
Mandæan and Manichæan cosmological and mythological systems on the one hand, and
the old Babylonian on the other. That there are points of striking resemblance it is certain.
There is ground to suspect, however, that he has been led by partiality for a theory of his
own to minimize unduly the Zoroastrian and Buddhist influence and to magnify unduly
the old Babylonian. Be that as it may, there remains an important residuum of solid fact
which must be taken account of by all future students of Manichæism. There is reason to
hope that future work along the lines of Kessler’s researches will bring to light much additional
material.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.— The Relation of Manichæism to Buddhism.</head>
<p>The extent of Mani’s dependence on Buddhism is a matter that has been much disputed.
The attention of scholars was first directed to this possible source of Manichæism by the
discovery of important features that are radically opposed to Zoroastrianism, Judaism and
Christianity, and by the traditional historical connection of Mani with India and Turkestan.
The antagonism of spirit and matter, of light and darkness, the mixture of spirit and light
with matter and darkness in the formation of the world, the final catastrophe in which
complete simplicity shall be re-established, only inert matter and darkness remaining to
represent the Kingdom of Darkness, abstinence from bloody sacrifices, from marriage, from
killing or eating animals—points in which Manichæism differs widely from the other systems
with which it stands historically related—find their counterpart in Buddhism. It is certain,
moreover, that they were fully developed in Buddhism centuries before the time of Mani.
Baur,11 though not the first to suggest a connection of the two systems, was the first to show
by a somewhat detailed comparison the close parallelism that exists between Manichæism
and Buddhism. Baur’s reasonings were still further elaborated and confirmed by Neander.12
External grounds in favor of Mani’s dependence on Buddhism are the traditions of Mani’s
journey to India and China, and of his prolonged stay in Turkestan, where Buddhism
flourished at that time. But it is on internal grounds that we chiefly rely.</p>
<p>If space permitted we could illustrate the close parallelism that undoubtedly exists
between Manichæism and Buddhism, from Buddhist documents which have been made
accessible through Professor Max Müller and his collaborators in The Sacred Book of the
East, far more completely than was possible to Baur and Neander. It is certain that parallels
can be found in Buddhism for almost every feature of Manichæism that is sharply antagonistic
to Zoroastrianism. The Buddhist view of matter as antagonistic to spirit is fundamental.
It is the world of matter that deludes. It is the body and its passions that prevent the longedfor
Nirvana. Buddhist asceticism is the direct outgrowth of the doctrine of the evil and delusive
nature of matter. The Buddhist doctrine of metempsychosis has its precise counterpart
in Manichæism, but it should be said that this doctrine was widely diffused in the West,
through Pythagoreanism, before the time of Mani. The Buddhist tenderness for animal and
plant life is paralleled by the Manichæan. But there is considerable difference between the
views on which this tenderness is based. The Buddhist feeling was based, in part at least,
upon the doctrine of metempsychosis, animals and plants being regarded as the abodes of
human spirits awaiting their release into Nirvana. The Manichæan looked upon the elements
of light (life) contained in animals and plants as particles of God, and any injury done to
them as a hindrance to the escape of these elements, to be conveyed away into the Kingdom
<note type="footnote">11 Das Manichäische Religionssystem, p. 433 sq.</note>
<note type="footnote">12 Church Hist. vol. I.</note>

<pb n="33"/>
of Light. Both looked upon sexual intercourse as among the greatest of evils, though the
theory in the two cases was slightly different. So of the drinking of wine, the eating of animal
food, etc. The final state was conceived of in substantially the same way in the two systems.
Nirvana, the blowing out of man’s life as an individual entity, is quite paralleled by the
Manichæan view of the gradual escape of the imprisoned particles of light into the Kingdom
of Light. In both cases the divine pleroma is to be restored in such a way as to destroy individual
consciousness.</p>
<p>The Buddhist Bhikkhus (or ascetical monks) correspond very closely with the Manichæan
Truthful Ones (Elect), and the relations of these to ordinary adherents of the parties was
much the same in the two cases. Both systems (like Christianity) had the proselyting spirit
fully developed. The position of Mani as a preacher or prophet corresponds with the
Buddhist idea of the manifestations of Buddha. The statement is attributed to Mani that
"as Buddha came in the land of India, Zoroaster in the land of Persia, and Jesus in the land
of the West, so at last in the epoch of the present this preaching came through me <del>Mani</del>
in the land of Babylonia." In the interest of his theory, which makes the old Babylonian religion
the chief source of Manichæism, Kessler has attempted to detract from the significance
of the Buddhist influence. Yet he grants that the morality of the Manichæans (including
many of the features mentioned above) was Buddhist. The close connection of the two
systems cannot, it would seem, be successfully gainsaid.13</p>
<note type="footnote">13 Cunningham, St. Austin and his Place in the History of Christian Thought (1886), has these remarks on
the relation of Mani to Buddhism: "Mani was indeed a religious reformer: deeply impregnated with the belief
and practice which Buddhist monks were spreading in the East, he tried with some success to reform the religion
of Zoroaster in Persia [i.e. the Persian Empire], his native land. While his fundamental doctrine, the root of his
system, was of Persian origin, and he figured the universe to himself as if it were given over to the unending
conflict between the Powers of Light and Darkness, in regard to discipline his system very closely resembles that
founded by Buddha; the elect of the Manichæans correspond to the Buddhist monks: the precepts about abstinence
from meat and things of sense are, if not borrowed from the rules Gotama gave for the conduct of his followers,
the outcome of the same principles about the nature of man." Harnack, art. Manichæism in Ency. Britannica,
follows Kessler in attaching slight importance to the Buddhist influence on Manichæism, preferring, with him,
to derive nearly all of the features ascribed by Baur, Neander and others to Buddhist influence, to the old Babylonian
religion, the precise character of which, in the time of Mani, is imperfectly understood. Harnack’s (and
Kessler’s) statements must therefore be taken with some allowance. There is no objection, however, to supposing
that Mani derived from the old Babylonian party or parties with which he came in contact religious principles
which were wrought out in detail under the influence of Buddhism. This is in fact what probably occurred.</note>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Relation of Manichæism to Judaism.</head>
<p>So far as a relation existed it was one of the intensest hostility. Like the Gnostics in
general, Manichæism looked upon the God of the Old Testament as an evil, or at least imperfect
being. On this matter we do not learn so much from the Oriental as from the
Western sources, but even from the former the radical antagonism is manifest.</p>
<p>The statement in the Fihrist’s narrative, that "Mani treated all the prophets disparagingly
in his books, degraded them, accused them of lying, and maintained that devils had possessed
them and that these spoke out of their mouths; nay, he goes so far as expressly to assert in
some passages of his books that the prophets were themselves devils," is precisely in the line
of the later Manichæan polemics against the Judaistic element in Christianity.</p>
<p>The Manichæan account of the creation shows some acquaintance with the Jewish
Scriptures or with Jewish tradition, yet the complete perversion of the Biblical account is
one of the clearest indications of hostility. It may be said in general that it is impossible to
conceive of two systems of religion that have less in common, or more that is sharply antagonistic.
One of the principal points of controversy between Manichæans and Christians
was the defense of the Jewish Scriptures and religion by the latter. The Manichæan demanded
the elimination from the current Christianity, and from the New Testament itself, of every
vestige of Judaism. Their objections to the Old Testament Scriptures and religion were in
general substantially the same as those made by other Gnostics, especially by the Marcionites.
The Old Testament anthropomorphic representations seem to have been offensive to them,
notwithstanding their own crude conceptions of the conflict between light and darkness,
of the creation, etc. The relation of God to the conquest of Canaan is a point that those inclined
to cavil have never failed to make the most of. The Old Testament encouragement
of race propagation, the narratives of polygamy as practised by those that enjoyed the favor
of the God of the Old Testament, the seeming approval of prevarication in several wellknown
cases, the institution of animal sacrifices, the allowing of the use of animal food,
were among the standard objections that they raised against Judaism and against Christians
who accepted the Old Testament. Judaism had, since the captivity, had many representatives
in Mesopotamia, and Mani was doubtless brought up to abominate the Jews. Some of his
extreme positions may have been primarily due to his radical anti-Judaistic tendencies. We
shall see hereafter how Augustin met the Manichæan objections to the Old Testament.</p>

<pb n="35"/>
<head>Chapter VIII.—The Relation of Manichæism to Christianity.</head>
<p>Far more superficial are the relations of Manichæism to Christianity than to any of the
heathen systems to which we have adverted. In fact no Christian idea has been introduced
into the system without being completely perverted. If Christian language is used, it is utterly
emptied of its meaning. If Christian practices are introduced, a completely different motive
lies at the basis. Indeed the wildest of the Christian Gnostic systems kept immeasurably
nearer to historical Christianity than did the Manichæans. While he blasphemed against
the historical Jesus, Mani claimed to believe in Christ, a purely spiritual and divine manifestation,
whose teachings had been sadly perverted by the Jews. It is scarcely possible to determine
with any certainty what view Mani actually took of New Testament history. That
he claimed to be a follower of Christ, and the Paraclete whom Christ had promised to send,
or at least the organ of the Paraclete, Eastern and Western authorities agree. Mani is said,
by Augustin, to have begun his Fundamental Epistle as follows: "Manichæus, an Apostle of
Jesus Christ, by the providence of God the Father. These are wholesome words from the
perennial and living fountain." So also in the Act. Archel., Mani is represented as introducing
a letter: "Manichæus, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, and all the saints who are with me, and
the virgins, to Marcellus, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God
the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ." There can be no doubt but that Mani and his
followers, whether from designed imposture or from less sinister motives, attempted to
palm themselves off as Christians, nay, as the only true Christians. It is certain, moreover,
that in this guise they gained many proselytes from the Christian ranks. As previously remarked,
Mani and his followers professed to accept the New Testament Scriptures, yet they
treated them in a purely subjective manner, eliminating as Judaistic interpolation whatever
they could not reconcile with their own tenets. Their adherence to the New Testament, as
well as their adherence to Christ, was, therefore, virtually a mere pretence. In common with
Christianity, Manichæism laid much stress on redemption, yet there was nothing in common
between the Christian idea of redemption through the atoning suffering of Jesus Christ and
the Manichæan notion of redemption through the escape of imprisoned light. Manichæans
and Christians were at one in advocating self-denial and the due subordination of the flesh.
It need not be pointed out how radically different the Christian view was from the Manichæan
view, already expounded. Yet pagan ascetical ideas had already invaded the Church long
before the time of Mani, and many Christians were in a position to be attracted strongly by
the Manichæan theory and practice. The later asceticism as it appeared in the hermit life
of the fourth and following centuries was essentially pagan and had much in common with
the Manichæan. Still more manifest is the anatagonism between Manichæism and Christianity
on the great fundamental principles of religion. The Manichæan and Christian ideas
of God are mutually contradictory. Christianity holds fast at the same time to the unity,

<pb n="36"/>
the omnipotence, the omniscience, the perfect wisdom, the holiness and the goodness of
God. If He permits sin to exist in the world it is not because He looks upon it with complacency,
nor because He lacked wisdom to provide against its rise or power to annihilate it at
once when it appeared, nor because He did not foresee its rise and its ravages, but because
the permission of sin forms part of His all-wise plan for the education of moral and spiritual
beings. If the forces of nature are under certain circumstances hurtful or destructive to
man, Christianity does not regard them as the operations of a malevolent power thwarting
God’s purposes, but it sees underneath the destructive violence purposes of goodness and
of grace; or if it fails to see them in any given instance it yet believes that God doeth all things
well. Christianity admits the existence of evil in men and in demons, yet of evil that ministers
to the purposes of the Most High. Christianity is the only religion that has been able to arrive
at a perfectly satisfactory theology, cosmology, anthropology, and eschatology, and this is
because Christianity alone has a true and satisfying soteriology. It is God manifest in the
flesh that meets all the conditions for the solution of the problem of human existence.
Manichæism openly antagonized Christianity in its adherence to Old Testament revelation,
including the Jewish and Christian monotheism. The good God could not, they maintained,
be the creator of this world and of the universe of being. That God should be looked upon
as in any sense the creator of the devil and his angels, and of the material world, was in their
view an absurdity—a monstrosity. The unchristian character of the Manichæan view of
matter, leading to unchristian asceticism, has already been sufficiently indicated. The
reader will only need to compare the principles and practices of Manichæism, as delineated
above, with those of Christianity as they are delineated in the New Testament and in the
evangelical churches of to-day, to be impressed with the completely anti-Christian character
of the former.</p>
<p>How then, it may well be asked, could Manichæism succeed as it did in fascinating so
many intelligent members of the Catholic Church during the third, fourth and fifth centuries?
In attempting to answer this question it should be premised that the later Western
Manichæism took far more account of historical Christianity than did Mani and his immediate
followers. In the West, at least, Manichæism set itself up as the only genuine exponent
of Christianity. The Jewish-Alexandrian philosophy, and Gnosticism its product, had done
much towards discrediting the Old Testament Scriptures, and the moral and religious
teachings therein contained. Devout Jewish and Christian thinkers who had adopted this
mode of thought, had attempted by means of the allegorical method of interpretation to
reconcile the seeming antagonism between Judaism and philosophy. But the process was
so forced that its results could not be expected to satisfy those that felt no special interest in
the removal of the difficulties. Marcionism represents a stern refusal to apply the allegory,
and a determination to exhibit the antagonism between Judaism and current thought, and
especially the seeming antagonism between Judaism and Christianity, in the harshest manner.

<pb n="37"/>
Marcionism was still vigorous in the East when Manichæism arose, and through this party
unfavorable views of the Old Testament were widely disseminated. Many Christians
doubtless felt that the Old Testament and its religion were burdensome and trammelling
to Christianity. The very fact that Mani set aside so summarily every element of Judaism
that he encountered in the current Christianity, doubtless commended his views to a large
and influential element in the East and the West alike. Mani claimed to set forth a spiritual
religion as opposed to a carnal. The asceticism of Manichæism was in the line of a widespread
popular ascetical movement that was already in progress, and so commended it to
many. The question as to the origin of evil, and as to the relation of the good, wise and
powerful God to the evil that appears in the world, in man and in demons was never asked
with more interest than during the early Christian centuries, and any party that should advance
a moderately plausible theory was sure to receive its share of public attention. Mani
professed to have a solution and the only possible solution of questions of this class, and
however fantastic may have been the forms in which his speculations were set forth, they
were doubtless all the more acceptable on this account in that semi-pagan age to many intelligent
people. The fact that these forms satisfied so able a thinker as Mani undoubtedly
was, would guarantee their acceptance by a large number both East and West. There was
in the West at this time, and had been for centuries, a hankering after Oriental theosophy,
the more extravagant the better. The wide-spread worship of Mithra was an excellent preparation
for the more complete system of Mani. Manichæism and Neo-Platonism antagonized
the Christianity of the fourth and fifth centuries from opposite sides, and those minds
for whom Platonism had no charms were almost sure to be attracted by the theosophy of
Mani. "How are we to explain," asks Harnack,14 "the rapid spread of Manichæism, and the
fact that it really became one of the great religions? Our answer is, that Manichæism was
the most complete Gnosis, the richest, most consequent and most artistic system formed
on the basis of the ancient Babylonian religion.… What gave strength to Manichæism was…
that it united its ancient mythology and a thorough-going materialistic dualism with an
exceedingly simple spiritual worship and a strict morality. On comparing it with the
Semitic religions of nature, we perceive that it retained their mythologies, after transforming
them into doctrines, but abolished all their sensuous cultus, substituting instead a spiritual
worship as well as a strict morality. Manichæism was thus able to satisfy the new wants of
an old world. It offered revelation, redemption, moral virtue, and immortality [this last is
very doubtful, if conscious immortality be meant], spiritual benefits on the basis of the religion
of nature. A further source of strength lay in the simple, yet firm social organization
which was given by Mani himself to his new institution. The wise man and the ignorant,
<note type="footnote">14 Encyclopædia Britannica, art. Manichæism.</note>

<pb n="38"/>
the enthusiast and the man of the world, could all find acceptance here, and there was laid
on no one more than he was able and willing to bear."</p>
<p>The question as to the secret of the fascination that Manichæism was able to exercise
even over the most intelligent Western minds, may receive a more concrete answer from
the autobiographical account of Augustin’s own relations to the party. What was it that
attracted and enthralled, for nine years, him who was to become the greatest theologian of
the age? In his Confessions (Book III. ch. 6) he gives this impassioned account of his first
connection with Manichæism: "Therefore I fell among men proudly railing, very carnal
and voluble, in whose mouth were the snares of the devil—the bird lime being composed
of a mixture of the syllables of Thy Name, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Paraclete,
the Holy Ghost, the Comforter. These names departed not out of their mouths, but so far
forth as the sound and clatter of the tongue; for the heart was empty of truth. Still they cried
‘Truth, Truth,’ and spoke much about it to me, yet it was not in them, but they spake falsely
not of Thee only—who, verily art the Truth—but also of the elements of this world, Thy
creatures… O Truth, Truth! how inwardly even then did the marrow of my soul pant after
Thee, when they frequently and in a multiplicity of ways, and in numerous and huge books,
sounded out Thy Name to me, though it was but a voice. And these were the dishes in which
to me, hungering for Thee, they, instead of Thee, served up the sun and the moon, Thy
beauteous works—but yet Thy works, not Thyself, nay, nor Thy first works…Woe, woe, by
what steps was I dragged down to the depths of hell!—toiling and turmoiling through want
of Truth, when I sought after Thee, my God,—to Thee I confess it, who hadst mercy on me
when I had not yet confessed, sought after Thee not according to the understanding of the
mind in which Thou desiredst that I should excel the beasts, but according to the sense of
the flesh."</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="39"/>
<head>Chapter IX.—Augustin and the Manichæans.</head>
<p>In the preceding Chapter we have given in Augustin’s own words some account of the
process by which he became ensnared in Manichæan error. In reading Augustin’s account
of his experience among the Manichæans, we can not escape the conviction that he was
never wholly a Manichæan, that he never surrendered himself absolutely to the system. He
held it rather as a matter of opinion than as a matter of heart-attachment. Doubtless the
fact that he continued to occupy himself with rhetorical and philosophical studies prevented
his complete enthrallment. His mind was not naturally of an Oriental cast, and the study
of the hard, common-sense philosophy of Aristotle, and of the Eclecticism of Cicero, could
hardly have failed to make him more or less conscious of the absurdity of Manichæism.
The influence of scientific studies on his mind is very manifest from Confessions, Book V.
ch. 3, where he compares the accurate astronomical knowledge with which he had become
acquainted, with the absurd cosmological fancies of Faustus, the great Manichæan teacher
who appeared at Carthage in Augustin’s twenty-ninth year. "Many truths, however, concerning
the creation did I retain from these men [the philosophers], and the cause appeared
to confirm calculations, the succession of seasons, and the visible manifestations of the stars;
and I compared them with the sayings of Manichæus, who in his frenzy has written most
extensively on these subjects, but discovered not any account either of the solstices, or the
equinoxes, the eclipses of the luminaries, or anything of the kind I had learned in the books
of secular philosophy. But therein I was ordered to believe, and yet it corresponded not
with those rules acknowledged by calculation and by our light, but was far different."</p>
<p>From this time Augustin’s faith was shaken, and he was soon able to throw off completely
the yoke that had become too grievous to be borne. But to reject Manichæism was not necessarily
to become an orthodox Christian. Augustin finds himself still greatly perplexed
about the nature of God and the origin of evil, problems the somewhat plausible Manichæan
solutions of which had ensnared him. It was through Platonism, or rather Neo-Platonism,
that he was led to more just and satisfying views, and through Platonism, along with other
influences, he was enabled at last to find peace in the bosom of the Catholic church. "And
Thou, willing to show me how Thou ‘resistest the proud, but givest grace unto the humble,’
and by how great an act of mercy Thou hadst pointed out to men the path of humility, in
that ‘Thy Word was made flesh and dwelt among men,’—Thou procuredst for me, by the
instrumentality of one inflated with monstrous pride, certain books of the Platonists,
translated from Greek into Latin. And therein I read not indeed in the same words but to
the self-same effect, enforced by many and divers reasons, that ‘In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning

<pb n="40"/>
with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was
made.’"15 In other words, Augustin thought that he discerned complete harmony between
the prologue of John’s gospel and the teachings of the Platonists, and in this teaching, thus
corroborated, he found the solution of the problem that had caused him such anguish of
soul. In this connection Augustin points out in some detail the features that Platonism and
Christianity have in common. Thus Neo-Platonism, not blindly followed, but adapted to
his Christian purpose, became not only a means of deliverance to Augustin himself, but a
mighty weapon for the combating of Manichæan error.</p>
<p>Neo-Platonism enters so largely and influentially into Augustin’s polemics against
Manichæism that it will be apposite here to inquire into the extent and the nature of Augustin’s
dependence on this system of thought. Much has been written on this subject, especially
by German and French scholars. A brief statement of some of the more important
points of contact is all that is allowable in an essay like this. Premising, therefore, that Platonism
essentially influenced the entire circle of Augustin’s theological and philosophical
thinking, let us first examine the Neo-Platonic and Augustinian conceptions of God. With
Augustin God is absolutely simple and immutable, incomprehensible by men in their present
state of existence, exalted above all human powers of thought or expression. All things may
be said of God, and yet nothing worthily; God is honored more by reverential silence than
by any human voice. He is better known by not being known; it is easier to say what He is
not, than what He is. God is wanting in qualities; has no variety and multitude of properties
and attributes; is absolutely simple. By no means is God to be called substance, for the word
substance pertains to a certain accident; nor is it allowable to think of Him as composed of
substance and of accidents. Divine qualities are therefore purely subjective. There is no
discrimination in God of substance and accidents, of potency and act, of matter and form,
of universal and singular, of superior and inferior. To know, to will, to do, to be, are in God
equivalent and identical. Eternity itself is the substance of God, which has nothing mutable,
nothing past, nothing future. God makes new things, without being Himself new, unchangeable
He makes changeable things, He always works and always rests. The changes that take
place in the world do not fall in the will of God, but solely in the things moved by God. God
changes them out of His unchangeable counsel. For nearly every one of these statements
an almost exact parallel can be pointed out in the writings of Plotinus, the Neo-Platonic
writer with whom Augustin was most conversant.16 It would be easy to point out that Augustin
here goes to a dangerous extreme, and narrowly escapes fatalism on the one hand,
<note type="footnote">15 Confessions, Book. VII. ch. 9, vol. 1. p. 108, of the present series.</note>
<note type="footnote">16 See G. Loesche: De Augustino Plotinizante in Doctrina de Deo Disserenda, Jenæ, 1880. Also, Dorner:
Augustinus, Zeller, Ueberweg, Ritter, and Erdmann: Histories of Philosophy, sections on Augustin and Neo-
Platonism.</note>

<pb n="41"/>
and denial of the true personality of God on the other. But the effectiveness of this type of
teaching against Manichæism is what chiefly interests us in this connection. Readers of the
following treatises will have no difficulty in seeing for themselves how confidently and with
what telling effect Augustin employs this view of God against the crudities of Manichæism,
which thought of God as mutable, as capable of being successfully assailed by evil, as rent
asunder, as suffering miserable contamination and imprisonment by mixture with matter,
as painfully struggling for freedom, as suffering with the suffering of plants and animals, as
liberated by their decay and by the digestive operations of the faithful, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Again, while still a Manichæan Augustin had thought and written much about beauty.
On this point also, the throwing off of Manichæism and the adoption of a Platonizing
Christianity brought about a revolution in his conceptions. The exactness with which he
has followed Plotinus in his ideas of the beauty of God and of his creatures is remarkable.
This we could fully illustrate by the citation of parallel passages. But we must content our
selves with remarking that Augustin himself acknowledged his indebtedness, and that his
idea of beauty was an important factor in his polemics against Manichæism. According to
Augustin (and Plotinus) God is the most beautiful and splendid of all beings. He is the
beauty of all beauties; all the beautiful things that are the objects of our vision and love He
Himself made. If these are beautiful what is He? All beauty is from the highest beauty,
which is God. Augustin follows Plato and Plotinus even in neglecting the distinction between
the good and the beautiful. The idea of Divine beauty Augustin applies to Christ also. He
speaks of Him as beautiful God, beautiful Word with God, beautiful on earth, beautiful in
the womb, beautiful in the hands of his parents, beautiful in miracles, beautiful in being
scourged, beautiful when inciting to life, beautiful when not caring for death, beautiful when
laying down his life, beautiful when taking it up again, beautiful in the sepulchre, beautiful
in Heaven. The beauty of the creation, which is simply a reflection of the beauty of God, is
not even disturbed by evil or sin. Beauty is with Augustin (and the Platonists) a comprehensive
term, and is almost equivalent to perfect harmony or symmetry of parts, perfect
adaptation of beings to the ends for which they exist.</p>
<p>It is patent that this view of the beauty of God and His creation is diametrically opposed
to the crude conceptions of Mani, with reference to the disorder of the universe, a disorder
not confined even to the Kingdom of Darkness, but invading the Realm of light itself. So
also Augustin’s Platonizing views of the creation must be taken into consideration in judging
of his attitude towards Manichæism. It goes without saying that from Augustin’s theological
point of view, to account for creation is a matter of grave difficulty. How can there be a relation
between the infinite and the finite? Any substantial connection is unthinkable. The
only thing left is a relation of causality. The finite, according to Plotinus, is an accident, an
image and shadow of God. It is constituted, established, sustained, and nourished by the
Divine potency, and is therefore absolutely dependent upon God. The power that flows

<pb n="42"/>
from God permeates each and every finite thing. God as one, whole, and indivisible, is
perpetually present with his eternal process, to everything, everywhere. When Augustin
teaches that God of his own free will, subject to no necessity, by His own Word created the
world out of nothing, this statement might be taken in connection with his view of the absolute
simplicity of God and the consequent denial of distinction between being, willing,
doing, etc. The easiest way to get over the difficulty involved in creation was to maintain
the simultaneous creation of all things. The six days of creation in Genesis are an accommodation
to human modes of thinking. In some expressions Augustin approaches the
Platonic doctrine of the ideal or archetypal world. Finite things, so far as they exist, are essence,
i.e., God; so far as they are not essence they do not exist at all. Thus the distinction
between God and the world is almost obliterated. Again, whatever is finite and derivative
is subject to negation or nothingness. Thus he goes along with Plato and Plotinus to the
verge of denying the reality of derived existence, and so narrowly escapes pantheism.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how effectively this conception of creation might be employed against
the Manichæan notion of the creation as something forced upon God by the powers of evil,
and as a mere expedient for the gradual liberation of his imprisoned elements. The
Manichæan limitation of God and his domain by the bordering Kingdom of Darkness, was
in sheer opposition to Augustin’s view of the indivisibility of God and his presence as a
whole everywhere and always. Augustin’s theory that nature or essence, as far as it has existence
is God, is quite the antithesis of Mani’s dualism, especially of his supposition that
the Kingdom of Darkness is essentially and wholly evil. Augustin argued that even the inhabitants
of the Kingdom of Darkness, and the King of Darkness himself, according to
Mani’s own representations, are good so far as they have essence or nature, and evil only so
far as they are non-existent.</p>
<p>With Augustin’s Platonizing view of creation is closely connected his theory of evil and
his doctrine of divine providence. Evil with him, as with the Platonists, has no substantial
existence. It is only privation of good. It is wanting in essence, substance, truth,—is in short
mere negation, and so cannot have God for its efficient cause or author, or be referred to
God. God would not have permitted evil unless by His own supreme power he had been
able to make good use of it. He attempts, with some success, to show the advantages of the
permission of evil in the world. God made all things good from the angels of heaven to the
lowest beasts and herbs of the earth. Augustin delighted, with the Platonists, in dwelling
upon the goodness of nature as shown in the animal and vegetable worlds, as well as in the
great cosmical phenomena. Each creature of God has its place, some a higher, some a lower,
but all so far as they conform to the idea of their creation, or to their nature, are good. So
far as they fall short of this idea they are evil.</p>
<p>This principle Augustin applied with great force to the confutation of the Manichæan
view of the substantiality and permanence of evil. This may be regarded as the central point

<pb n="43"/>
in Augustin’s controversies with the Manichæans. He evidently felt that the Manichæan
view of evil was the citadel of their system, and he never wearied of assailing it. It would be
beyond the scope of the present essay to inquire whether and how far Augustin himself became
involved in error, in his efforts to dislodge the Manichæans. Far less satisfactory than
his confutation of the fundamental principles of the Manichæan system were his answers
to the Manichæan cavils against the Old Testament. If we may judge from the prominence
given in the extant literature to the Old Testament question, this must have been the favorite
point of attack with the Manichæans. The importance of the questions raised and the necessity
of answering them was fully recognized by Augustin. His principal reliance is the
allegorical or typological method of interpretation. It would be hard to find examples of
more perverse allegorizing than Augustin’s Anti-Manichæan treatises furnish. It will not
be needful to adduce instances here, as readers of the treatises will discover them in
abundance. Nothing more wearisome and disgusting in Biblical interpretation can well be
conceived of than certain sections of The Reply to Faustus, the Manichæan. Yet Augustin
did not fail entirely to recognize the distinction between Old Testament times and New,
and he even suggests the theory "that God could in a former age and to a people of a lower
moral standard, give commands to do actions, which we should think it wrong to do now.…
There was a certain inward want, an unenlightenment, a rudeness of moral conception, in
those to whom such commands were given; otherwise they would not have been given.
God would not have given a command to slaughter a whole nation to an enlightened
people."17</p>
<p>Yet with all the defects of Augustin’s polemics against the Manichæans, they seem to
have been adapted to the needs of the time. Well does Canon Mozley declare Augustin to
have been "the most marvellous controversial phenomenon which the whole history of the
Church from first to last presents.… Armed with superabundant facility of expression,—so
that he himself observes that one who had written so much must have a good deal to answer
for,—he was able to hammer any point of view which he wanted, and which was desirable
as a counteracting one to a pervading heresy, with endless repetition upon the ear of the
Church; at the same time varying the forms of speech sufficiently to please and enliven."
Certainly he was one of the greatest debaters of any age. He doubtless deserves the credit
of completely checking the progress of Manichæism in the West, and of causing its gradual
but almost complete overthrow. His arguments were probably more effective in guarding

Christians against perversion by Manichæan proselytizers, than in converting those that
were already ensnared by Manichæan error. Other controversies of a completely different
character, especially the Pelagian, caused Augustin to look to other aspects of truth and so
led to certain modifications in his own statements, nay led him on some occasions to the
verge of Manichæan error itself. But we are chiefly interested at present in knowing that
his earnest efforts against the Manichæans from A.D. 388, the year of his baptism, to A.D.
405, were not in vain.18</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Outline of Manichæan History.19</head>
<p>In the East Mani’s followers were involved in the persecution that resulted in his death,
and many of them fled to Transoxiania. Their headquarters and the residence of the chief
of the sect continued to be Babylon. They returned to Persia in 661, but were driven back,
908–32. They seem to have become very numerous in the Transoxiania. Albîrûnî, 973–1048,
speaks of the Manichæans as still existing in large numbers throughout all Mohammedan
lands, and especially in the region of Samarkand, where they were known as Sabeans. He
also relates that they were prevalent among the Eastern Turks, in China, Thibet and India.
In Armenia and Cappadocia they gained many followers, and thence made their way into
Europe. The Paulicians are commonly represented as a Manichæan party, but the descriptions
that have come down to us would seem to indicate Marcionitic rather than Manichæan
elements. Yet contemporary Catholic writers such as Peter Siculus and Photius constantly
assail them as Manichæans.</p>
<p>In the West we have traces of their existence from 287 onwards. Diocletian, according
to a somewhat doubtful tradition, condemned its leaders to the stake, and its adherents to
decapitation with confiscation of goods. The edict is supposed to have been directed to the
pro-consul of Africa where Manichæans were making great progress. According to an early
account, Mani sent a special envoy to Africa. Valentinian (372) and Theodosius (381) issued
bloody edicts against them, yet we find them still aggressive in the time of Augustin. From
Africa Manichæism spread into Spain, Gaul and Aquitaine. Leo the Great and Valentinian
III. took measures against them in Italy (440 sq.). They appear, however, to have continued
their work, for Gregory the Great mentions them (590 sq.). From this time onwards their
influence is to be traced in such parties as the Euchites, Enthusiasts, Bogomiles, Catharists,
Beghards, etc. But it is not safe to attach too much importance to the mere fact that these
parties were stigmatized as Manichæans by their enemies. Even in the Reformation time
and since, individuals and small parties have appeared which in some features strongly resembled
the ancient Manichæans. Manichæism was a product of the East, and in the East
it met with most acceptance. To the spirit of the West it was altogether foreign, and only
in a greatly modified form could it ever have flourished there. It might persist for centuries
as a secret society, but it could not endure the light.</p>

<head>Preface to the Anti-Manichæan Writings.</head>
<p>No reader of the accompanying volume can be expected to take a very lively interest in
its contents, unless he has before his mind some facts regarding the extraordinary genius
to whom the heresy of Manichæism owes its origin and its name. His history is involved
in considerable obscurity, owing to the suspicious nature of the documents from which it
is derived, and the difficulty of constructing a consistent and probable account out of the
contradictory statements of the Asiatics and the Greeks. The ascertained facts, therefore,
are few, and may be briefly stated.20</p>
<p>According to the Chronicle of Edessa, Mani was born A.D. 240.21 From his original
name, Corbicius or Carcubius, Beausobre conjectures that he was born in Carcub, a town
of Chaldæa. He belonged to a Magian family, and while still a youth won a distinguished
place among the sages of Persia. He was master of all the lore peculiar to his class, and was,
besides, so proficient a mathematician and geographer, that he was able to construct a globe.
He was a skilled musician, and had some knowledge of the Greek language,—an accomplishment
rare among his countrymen. But his fame, and even his ultimate success as a teacher,
was due in great measure to his skill in painting, which was so considerable as to earn for
him among the Persians the distinctive title, Mani the painter. His disposition was ardent
and lively but patient and self-restrained. His appearance was striking, as he wore the usual
dress of a Persian sage: the high-soled shoes, the one red, the other green; the mantle of
azure blue, that changed color as he moved; the ebony staff in his right hand, and the
Babylonish book under his left arm.</p>
<p>The meaning of his name, Mani, Manes, or Manichæus, has been the subject of endless
conjectures. Epiphanius supposes that he was providentially so named, that men might be
warned against the mania of his heresy.22 Hyde, whose opinion on any Oriental subject
<note type="footnote">20 Beausobre (Histoire Critique de Manichée et du Manichéisme, Amst. 1734, 2 vols.) has collected everything
that is known of Mani. The original sources are here sifted with unusual acuteness, and with great and solid
learning, though the author’s strong "bias in favor of a heretic" frequently leads him to make unwarranted
statements. Burton’s estimate of this entertaining and indispensable work (Heresies of Apostol. Age, p. xxi.), is
much fairer than Pusey’s (Aug. Conf. p. 314). A brief account of Mani and his doctrines is given by Milman
with his usual accuracy, impartiality and lucidity (Hist. of Christianity, ii. 259, ed. 1867). For any one who wishes
to investigate the subject further, ample references are there given. A specimen of the confusion that involves
the history of Mani will be found in the account given by Socrates (Hist. i. 22).</note>

must have weight, tells us that in Persian mani means painter, and that he was so called
from his profession. Archbishop Usher conjectured that it was a form of Manaem or Menahem,
which means Paraclete or Comforter; founding this conjecture on the fact that
Sulpicius Severus calls the Israelitish king Menahem,23 Mane. Gataker supplements this
idea by the conjecture that Mani took this name at his own instance, and in pursuance of
his claim to be the Paraclete. It is more probable that, if his name was really given on account
of this meaning, he received it from the widow who seems to have adopted him when a boy,
and may have called him her Consolation. But it is also possible that Mani was not an uncommon
Persian name, and that he adopted it for some reason too trifling to discover.24</p>
<p>While still a young man he was ordained as a Christian priest, and distinguished himself
in that capacity by his knowledge of Scripture, and the zeal with which he discharged his
sacred functions.25 His heretical tendencies, however, were very soon manifested, stimulated,
we may suppose, by his anxiety to make the Christian religion more acceptable to those
who adhered to the Eastern systems. Excommunicated from the Christian Church, Mani
found asylum with Sapor, and won his confidence by presenting only the Magian side of
his system. But no sooner did he permit the Christian element to appear, and call himself
the apostle of the Lord, and show a desire to reform Magianism, than his sovereign determined
to put him to death as a revolutionist. Forced to flee, he took refuge in Turkestan, and
gained influence there, partly by decorating the temples with paintings. To lend his doctrines
the appearance of divine authority, he adopted the same device as Zoroaster and Mohammed.
Having discovered a cave through which there ran a rill of water, he laid up in it a store of
provisions, and retired there for a year, giving out that he was on a visit to heaven. In this
retirement he produced his Gospel,26—a work illustrated with symbolical drawings the ingenuity
of which has been greatly praised. This book Mani presented to Hormizdas, the
son and successor of Sapor, who professed himself favorable to his doctrine, and even built
him a castle as a place of shelter and retirement. Unfortunately for Mani, Hormizdas died
in the second year of his reign; and though his successor, Varanes, was at first willing to
shield him from persecution, yet, finding that the Magians were alarmed for their religion,
he appointed a disputation to be held between the opposing parties. Such trials of dialectic
in Eastern courts have not unfrequently resulted in very serious consequences to the parties
engaged in them. In this instance the result was fatal to Mani. Worsted in argument, he
was condemned to die, and thus perished in some sense as a martyr. The mode of his death

is uncertain,27 but it seems that his skin was stuffed with chaff, and hung up in public in
terrorem. This occurred in the year 277, and the anniversary was commemorated as the
great religious festival of the Manichæans.</p>
<p>This is not the place to attempt any account or criticism of the strange eclecticism of
Mani.28 An adequate idea of the system may be gathered from the accompanying treatises.
It may, however, be desirable to give some account of the original sources of information
regarding it.</p>
<p>We study the systems of heresiarchs at a disadvantage when our only means of ascertaining
their opinions is from the fragmentary quotations and hostile criticism which occur
in the writings of their adversaries. Such, however, is our only source of information regarding
the teaching of Mani. Originally, indeed, this heresy was specially active in a literary
direction, assailing the Christian Scriptures with an ingenuity of unbelief worthy of a later
age, and apparently ambitious of promulgating a rival canon. Certainly the writings of its
early supporters were numerous;29 and from the care and elegance with which they were
transcribed, the sumptuous character of the manuscripts, and the mysterious emblems with
which they were adorned, we should fancy it was intended to inspire the people with respect
for an authoritative though as yet undefined code. It is, indeed, nowhere said or implied
that the sacred books of the Manichæans were reserved for the eye only of the initiated or
elect; and their reception of the New Testament Scriptures (subject to their own revision
and emendation) would make it difficult for them to establish any secret code apart from
these writings. They were certainly, however, doctrines of an esoteric kind, which were not
divulged to the catechumens or hearers; and many of their books, being written in Persian,
Syriac, or Greek, were practically unavailable for the instruction of the Latin speaking population.
It was not always easy, therefore, to obtain an accurate knowledge of their opinions.
Commentaries on the whole of the Old and New Testaments were written by Hierax;30 a
Theosophy by Aristocritus; a book of memoirs, or rather Memorabilia, of Mani, and other
works, by Heraclides, Aphthonius, Adas, and Agapius. Unfortunately all of these books
have perished, whether in the flames to which the Christian authorities commanded that

verfolgt, nach mannig fachem Wechsel unter Bahram lebendig geschunden wurde" (p. 386).</note>
<note type="footnote">28 Böhringer characterizes it briefly in the words: "Es ist der alte heidnische Dualismus mit seiner Naturtheologie,
der in Mani’s Systeme seine letzten Kräfte sammelt und unter der gleissenden Hülle christlicher Worte und
Formen an den reinen Monotheismus des Christenthums und dessen reine Ethik sich heranwagt "</note>

<note type="footnote">30 Lardner, however, seems to prove that Hierax was not a Manichæan, though some of his opinions approximated
to this heresy. The whole subject of the Manichæan literature is treated by Lardner (Works, iii. p. 374),
with the learning of Beausobre and more than Beausobre’s impartiality.</note>

<pb n="49"/>
all Manichæan books should be consigned, or by the slower if not more critical and impartial
processes of time.</p>
<p>Mani himself was the author of several works: a Gospel, the Treasury of Life (and
probably an abridgment of the same), the Mysteries, the Foundation Fpistle, a book of Articles
or heads of doctrine, one or two works on astronomy or astrology, and a collection of letters
so dangerous, that Manichæans who sought restoration to the Church were required to
anathematize them.</p>
<p>Probably the most important of these writings was the Foundation Epistle, so called
because it contained the leading articles of doctrine on which the new system was built.
This letter was written in Greek or Syriac; but a Latin version of it was current in Africa,
and came into the hands of Augustin, who undertook its refutation. To accomplish this
with the greater precision and effect, he quotes the entire text of each passage of the Epistle
before proceeding to criticise it. Had Augustin accomplished the whole of his task, we
should accordingly have been in possession of the whole of this important document. Unfortunately,
for reasons unknown, Augustin stops short at an early point in the Epistle; and
though he tells us he had notes on the remainder, and would some day expand and publish
them, this promise lay unredeemed for thirty years till the day of his death. Extracts from
the same Epistle and from the Treasury are also given by Augustin in the treatise De Natura
Boni.31</p>
<p>Next, we have in the Opus Imperfectum of Augustin some extracts from a letter of Mani
to Menoch, which Julian had unearthed and republished to convict Augustin of being still
tainted with Manichæan sentiments. These extracts give us some insight into the heresiarch’s
opinions regarding the corruption of nature and the evils of sexual love.</p>
<p>Again, we have Mani’s letter to Marcel, preserved by Epiphanius, and given in full by
Beausobre;32 which, however, merely reiterates two of the doctrines most certainly identified
with Mani,—the assertion of two principles, and the tenet that the Son of God was man only
in appearance.</p>
<p>Finally, Fabricius has inserted in the fifth volume of his Bibliotheca Græca the fragments,
such as they are, collected by Grabe.</p>
<p>Such is the fragmentary character of the literary remains of Mani: for fuller information
regarding his opinions we must depend on Theodoret, Epiphanius, Alexander of Lycopolis,
<note type="footnote">31 The De Natura Boni, written in the year 405, is necessarily very much a reproduction of what is elsewhere
affirmed, that all natures are good, and created by God, who alone is immutable and incorruptible. It presents
concisely the leading positions of Augustin in this controversy, and concludes with an eloquent prayer that his
efforts may be blessed to the conversion of the heretics,—not the only passage which demonstrates that he wrote
not for the glory of victory so much as for the deliverance of men from fatal error.</note>

Titus of Bostra, and Augustin. Beausobre is of opinion that the Fathers derived all that they
knew of Manichæus from the Acts of Archelaus.33 This professes to be a report of a disputation
held between Manes and Archelaus, bishop of Caschar in Mesopotamia. Grave doubts
have been cast on the authenticity of this document, and Burton and Milman seem inclined
to consider it an imaginary dialogue, and use it on the understanding that while some of its
statements are manifestly untrustworthy, a discriminating reader may gather from it some
reliable material.34</p>
<p>In the works of Augustin there are some other pieces which may well be reckoned among
the original sources. In the reply to Faustus, which is translated in this volume, the book
of Faustus is not indeed reproduced; but there is no reason for doubting that his arguments
are fairly represented, and we think there is evidence that even the original expression of
them is preserved.35 Augustin had been acquainted with Faustus for many years. He first
met him at Carthage in 383, and found him nothing more than a clever and agreeable talker,
making no pretension to science or philosophy, and with only slender reading.36 His cleverness
is sufficiently apparent in his debate with Augustin; the objections he leads are
plausible, and put with acuteness, but at the same time with a flippancy which betrays a
want of earnestness and real interest in the questions. In his reply to Faustus, Augustin is
very much on the defensive, and his statements are apologetic rather than systematic.37</p>
<p>But in an age when the ability to read was by no means commensurate with the interest
taken in theological questions, written discussions were necessarily supplemented by public
disputations. These theological contests seem to have been a popular entertainment in
<note type="footnote">33 Published by Zaccagni in his Collectanea Monumentorum Veterum, Romæ, 1698; and by Routh his Reliquiæ
Sacræ, vol. v., in which all the material for forming an opinion regarding it is collected.</note>
<note type="footnote">34 Any one who consults Beausobre on this point will find that historical criticism is not of so recent an
origin as some persons seem to think. It is worth transcribing his own account of the spirit in which he means
to do his work: "Je traiterai mon sujet en Critique, suivant la Regle de S. Paul, Examinez toutes choses, et ne
retenez que ce qui est bon. L’Histoire en general, et l’Histoire Ecclesiastique en particulier, n’est bien souvent qu’un
mélange confus de faux et de vrai, entasse par des Ecrivains mal instruits, credules ou passionez. Cela convient
surtout a l’Histoire des Heretiques et des Heresies. C’est au Lecteur attentif et judicieux d’en faire le discernement,
a l’aide d’une critique, qui ne soit trop timide, ni temeraire. Sans le secours de cet art, on erre dans l’Histoire
comme un Pilote sur les mers, lorsqu’il n’a ni boussole, ni carte marine" (i. 7).</note>
<note type="footnote">35 Beausobre and Cave suppose that we have the whole of Faustus’ book embodied in Augustin’s review of
it. Lardner is of opinion that the commencement, and perhaps the greater part, of the work is given, but not
the whole.</note>

North Africa; the people attending in immense crowds, while reporters took down what
was said on either side for the sake of appeal as well as for the information of the absent.
In two such disputations Augustin engaged in connection with Manichæism.38 The first
was held on the 28th and 29th of August, 392, with a Manichæan priest, Fortunatus. To
this encounter Augustin was invited by a deputation of Donatists and Catholics,39 who were
alike alarmed at the progress which this heresy was making in the district of Hippo. Fortunatus
at first showed some reluctance to meet so formidable an antagonist, but was prevailed
upon by his own sectaries, and shows no nervousness during the debate. His incompetence,
however, was manifest to the Manichæans themselves; and so hopeless was it to think of
any further proselytizing in Hippo, that he left that city, and was too much ashamed of
himself ever to return. The character of his reasoning is shifty; he evades Augustin’s questions
and starts fresh ones. Augustin pushes his usual and fundamental objection to the
Manichæan system. If God is impassable and incorruptible, how could He be injured by
the assaults of the kingdom of darkness? In opposition to the statement of Fortunatus, that
the Almighty produces no evil, he explains that God made no nature evil, but made man
free, and that voluntary sin is the grand original evil. The most remarkable circumstance
in the discussion is the desire of Fortunatus to direct the conversation to the conduct of the
Manichæans, and the refusal of Augustin to make good the charges which had been made
against them, or to discuss anything but the doctrine.40</p>
<p>Twelve years after this, a similar disputation was held between Augustin and one of the
elect among the Manichæans, who had come to Hippo to propagate his religion. This man,
Felix, is described by Augustin41 as being ill-educated, but more adroit and subtle than
Fortunatus. After a keen discussion, which occupied two days, the proceedings terminated
by Felix signing a recantation of his errors in the form of an anathema on Mani, his doctrines,
<note type="footnote">38 His willingness to do so, and the success with which he encountered the most renowned champions of
this heresy, should have prevented Beausobre from charging him with misunderstanding or misrepresenting
the Manichæan doctrine. The retractation of Felix tells strongly against this view of Augustin’s incompetence
to deal with Manichæism.</note>
<note type="footnote">39 Possidius. Vita Aug. vi.</note>
<note type="footnote">40 This cannot but make us cautious in receiving the statements of the tract, On the Morals of the Manichæans.
There can be little doubt that many of the Manichæans practiced the ascetic virtues, and were recognizable by
the gauntness and pallor of their looks, so that Manichæan became a by-word for any one who did not appreciate
the felicity of good living. Thus Jerome says of a certain class of women, "quam viderint pallentem atque tristem,
Miseram, Monacham, et Manichæan vocant" (De Custod. Virg. Ep. 18). Lardner throws light on the practices
of the Manichæans, and effectually disposes of some of the calumnies uttered regarding them. Pusey’s appendix
to his translation of the Confessions may also be referred to with advantage.</note>

and the seducing spirit that possessed him. These two disputations are valuable, as exhibiting
the points of the Manichæan system to which its own adherents were accustomed to direct
attention, and the arguments on which they specially relied for their support.</p>
<p>The works given in the accompanying volume comprehend by no means the whole of
Augustin’s writings against this heresy. Before his ordination he wrote five anti-Manichæan
books, entitled, De Libero Arbitrio, De Genesi contra Manichæos, De Moribus Ecclesiæ
Catholicæ, De Moribus Manichæorum, and De Vera Religione. These Paulinus called his
anti-Manichæan Pentateuch. After his ordination he was equally diligent, publishing a little
treatise in the year 391, under the title De Utilitate Credendi,42 which was immediately followed
by a small work, De Duabus Animabus. In the following year the report of the Disputatio
contra Fortunatum was published; and after this, at short intervals, there appeared the
books Contra Adimantum, Contra Epistolam Manichæi quam vocant Fundamenti, Contra
Faustum, Disputatio contra Felicem, De Naturo Boni, and Contra Secundinum.</p>
<p>Besides these writings, which are exclusively occupied with Manichæism, there are
others in which the Manichæan doctrines are handled with more or less directness. These
are the Confessions, the 79th and 236th Letters, the Lecture on Psalm 140, Sermons 1, 2, 12,
50, 153, 182, 237, the Liber de Agone Christiano, and the De Continentia.</p>
<p>Of these writings, Augustin himself professed a preference for the reply to the letter of
Secundinus.43 It is a pleasing feature of the times, that a heretic whom he did not know
even by sight should write to Augustin entreating him to abstain from writing against the
Manichæans, and reconsider his position, and ally himself with those whom he had till now
fancied to be in error. His language is respectful, and illustrates the esteem in which Augustin
was held by his contemporaries; though he does not scruple to insinuate that his conversion
from Manichæism was due to motives not of the highest kind. We have not given this letter
and its reply, because the preference of Augustin has not been ratified by the judgment of
his readers.</p>
<p>The present volume gives a fair sample of Augustin’s controversial powers. His nine
years’ personal experience of the vanity of Manichæism made him thoroughly earnest and
sympathetic in his efforts to disentangle other men from its snares, and also equipped him
with the knowledge requisite for this task. No doubt the Pelagian controversy was more
congenial to his mind. His logical acuteness and knowledge of Scripture availed him more
in combating men who fought with the same weapons, than in dealing with a system which
threw around its positions the mist of Gnostic speculation, or veiled its doctrine under a
grotesque mythology, or based itself on a cosmogony too fantastic for a Western mind to

tolerate.44 But however Augustin may have misconceived the strange forms in which this
system was presented, there is no doubt that he comprehended and demolished its fundamental
principles;45 that he did so as a necessary part of his own personal search for the
truth; and that in doing so he gained possession, vitally and permanently of ideas and
principles which subsequently entered into all he thought and wrote. In finding his way
through the mazes of the obscure region into which Mani had led him, he once for all ascertained
the true relation subsisting between God and His creatures, formed his opinion regarding
the respective provinces of reason and faith, and the connection of the Old and
New Testaments, and found the root of all evil in the created will.</p>

<head>Of the Morals of the Catholic Church.46</head>
<p><del>De Moribus Ecclesiæ Catholicæ</del>. a.d. 388.</p>
<p>It is laid down at the outset that the customs of the holy life of the Church should be referred
to the chief good of man, that is, God. We must seek after God with supreme affection;
and this doctrine is supported in the Catholic Church by the authority of both Testaments.
The four virtues get their names from different forms of this love. Then follow the duties
of love to our neighbor. In the Catholic Church we find examples of continence and of
true Christian conduct.</p>
<note type="footnote">46 Written in the year 388. In his Retractations (i. 7) Augustin says: "When I was at Rome after my baptism,
and could not bear in silence the vaunting of the Manichæans about their pretended and misleading continence
or abstinence, in which, to deceive the inexperienced, they claim superiority over true Christians, to whom they
are not to be compared, I wrote two books, one on the morals of the Catholic Church, the other on the morals
of the Manichæans."</note>

<pb n="56"/>
<head>Chapter 1.—How the Pretensions of the Manichæans are to Be Refuted. Two
Manichæan Falsehoods.</head>
<p>1. Enough, probably, has been done in our other books47 in the way of answering the
ignorant and profane attacks which the Manichæans make on the law, which is called the
Old Testament, in a spirit of vainglorious boasting, and with the approval of the uninstructed.
Here, too, I may shortly touch upon the subject. For every one with average intelligence
can easily see that the explanation of the Scriptures should be sought for from those who
are the professed teachers of the Scriptures; and that it may happen, and indeed always
happens, that many things seem absurd to the ignorant, which, when they are explained by
the learned, appear all the more excellent, and are received in the explanation with the
greater pleasure on account of the obstructions which made it difficult to reach the meaning.
This commonly happens as regards the holy books of the Old Testament, if only the man
who meets with difficulties applies to a pious teacher, and not to a profane critic, and if he
begins his inquiries from a desire to find truth, and not in rash opposition. And should the
inquirer meet with some, whether bishops or presbyters, or any officials or ministers of the
Catholic Church, who either avoid in all cases opening up mysteries, or, content with simple
faith, have no desire for more recondite knowledge, he must not despair of finding the
knowledge of the truth in a case where neither are all able to teach to whom the inquiry is
addressed, nor are all inquirers worthy of learning the truth. Diligence and piety are both
necessary: on the one hand, we must have knowledge to find truth, and, on the other hand,
we must deserve to get the knowledge.</p>
<p>2. But as the Manichæans have two tricks for catching the unwary, so as to make them
take them as teachers,—one, that of finding fault with the Scriptures, which they either
misunderstand or wish to be misunderstood, the other, that of making a show of chastity
and of notable abstinence,—this book shall contain our doctrine of life and morals according
to Catholic teaching, and will perhaps make it appear how easy it is to pretend to virtue,
and how difficult to possess virtue. I will refrain, if I can, from attacking their weak points,
which I know well, with the violence with which they attack what they know nothing of; for
I wish them, if possible, to be cured rather than conquered. And I will quote such testimonies
from the Scriptures as they are bound to believe, for they shall be from the New Testament;
and even from this I will take none of the passages which the Manichæans when hard pressed
are accustomed to call spurious, but passages which they are obliged to acknowledge and
approve. And for every testimony from apostolic teaching I will bring a similar statement
from the Old Testament, that if they ever become willing to wake up from their persistent
dreams, and to rise towards the light of Christian faith, they may discover both how far from

<head>Chapter 2.—He Begins with Arguments, in Compliance with the Mistaken Method
of the Manichæans.</head>
<p>3. Where, then, shall I begin? With authority, or with reasoning? In the order of nature,
when we learn anything, authority precedes reasoning. For a reason may seem weak, when,
after it is given, it requires authority to confirm it. But because the minds of men are obscured
by familiarity with darkness, which covers them in the night of sins and evil habits, and
cannot perceive in a way suitable to the clearness and purity of reason, there is most
wholesome provision for bringing the dazzled eye into the light of truth under the congenial
shade of authority. But since we have to do with people who are perverse in all their thoughts
and words and actions, and who insist on nothing more than on beginning with argument,
I will, as a concession to them, take what I think a wrong method in discussion. For I like
to imitate, as far as I can, the gentleness of my Lord Jesus Christ, who took on Himself the
evil of death itself, wishing to free us from it.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—Happiness is in the Enjoyment of Man’s Chief Good. Two Conditions
of the Chief Good: 1st, Nothing is Better Than It; 2d, It Cannot Be Lost Against
the Will.</head>
<p>4. How then, according to reason, ought man to live? We all certainly desire to live
happily; and there is no human being but assents to this statement almost before it is made.
But the title happy cannot, in my opinion, belong either to him who has not what he loves,
whatever it may be, or to him who has what he loves if it is hurtful or to him who does not
love what he has, although it is good in perfection. For one who seeks what he cannot obtain
suffers torture, and one who has got what is not desirable is cheated, and one who does not
seek for what is worth seeking for is diseased. Now in all these cases the mind cannot but
be unhappy, and happiness and unhappiness cannot reside at the same time in one man;
so in none of these cases can the man be happy. I find, then, a fourth case, where the happy
life exists,—when that which is man’s chief good is both loved and possessed. For what do
we call enjoyment but having at hand the objects of love? And no one can be happy who
does not enjoy what is man’s chief good, nor is there any one who enjoys this who is not
happy. We must then have at hand our chief good, if we think of living happily.</p>
<p>5. We must now inquire what is man’s chief good, which of course cannot be anything
inferior to man himself. For whoever follows after what is inferior to himself, becomes
himself inferior. But every man is bound to follow what is best. Wherefore man’s chief
good is not inferior to man. Is it then something similar to man himself? It must be so, if
there is nothing above man which he is capable of enjoying. But if we find something which
is both superior to man, and can be possessed by the man who loves it, who can doubt that
in seeking for happiness man should endeavor to reach that which is more excellent than
the being who makes the endeavor. For if happiness consists in the enjoyment of a good
than which there is nothing better, which we call the chief good, how can a man be properly
called happy who has not yet attained to his chief good? or how can that be the chief good
beyond which something better remains for us to arrive at? Such, then, being the chief good,
it must be something which cannot be lost against the will. For no one can feel confident
regarding a good which he knows can be taken from him, although he wishes to keep and
cherish it. But if a man feels no confidence regarding the good which he enjoys, how can
he be happy while in such fear of losing it?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="60"/>
<head>Chapter 4.—Man—What?</head>
<p>6. Let us then see what is better than man. This must necessarily be hard to find, unless
we first ask and examine what man is. I am not now called upon to give a definition of
man. The question here seems to me to be,—since almost all agree, or at least, which is
enough, those I have now to do with are of the same opinion with me, that we are made up
of soul and body,—What is man? Is he both of these? or is he the body only, or the soul
only? For although the things are two, soul and body, and although neither without the
other could be called man (for the body would not be man without the soul, nor again would
the soul be man if there were not a body animated by it), still it is possible that one of these
may be held to be man, and may be called so. What then do we call man? Is he soul and
body, as in a double harness, or like a centaur? Or do we mean the body only, as being in
the service of the soul which rules it, as the word lamp denotes not the light and the case
together, but only the case, yet it is on account of the light that it is so called? Or do we
mean only the mind, and that on account of the body which it rules, as horseman means
not the man and the horse, but the man only, and that as employed in ruling the horse?
This dispute is not easy to settle; or, if the proof is plain, the statement requires time. This
is an expenditure of time and strength which we need not incur. For whether the name
man belongs to both, or only to the soul, the chief good of man is not the chief good of the
body; but what is the chief good either of both soul and body, or of the soul only, that is
man’s chief good.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="61"/>
<head>Chapter 5.—Man’s Chief Good is Not the Chief Good of the Body Only, But the
Chief Good of the Soul.</head>
<p>7. Now if we ask what is the chief good of the body, reason obliges us to admit that it
is that by means of which the body comes to be in its best state. But of all the things which
invigorate the body, there is nothing better or greater than the soul. The chief good of the
body, then, is not bodily pleasure, not absence of pain, not strength, not beauty, not swiftness,
or whatever else is usually reckoned among the goods of the body, but simply the soul. For
all the things mentioned the soul supplies to the body by its presence, and, what is above
them all, life. Hence I conclude that the soul is not the chief good of man, whether we give
the name of man to soul and body together, or to the soul alone. For as according to reason,
the chief good of the body is that which is better than the body, and from which the body
receives vigor and life, so whether the soul itself is man, or soul and body both, we must
discover whether there is anything which goes before the soul itself, in following which the
soul comes to the perfection of good of which it is capable in its own kind. If such a thing
can be found, all uncertainty must be at an end, and we must pronounce this to be really
and truly the chief good of man.</p>
<p>8. If, again, the body is man, it must be admitted that the soul is the chief good of man.
But clearly, when we treat of morals,—when we inquire what manner of life must be held
in order to obtain happiness,—it is not the body to which the precepts are addressed, it is
not bodily discipline which we discuss. In short, the observance of good customs belongs
to that part of us which inquires and learns, which are the prerogatives of the soul; so, when
we speak of attaining to virtue, the question does not regard the body. But if it follows, as
it does, that the body which is ruled over by a soul possessed of virtue is ruled both better
and more honorably, and is in its greatest perfection in consequence of the perfection of
the soul which rightfully governs it, that which gives perfection to the soul will be man’s
chief good, though we call the body man. For if my coachman, in obedience to me, feeds
and drives the horses he has charge of in the most satisfactory manner, himself enjoying
the more of my bounty in proportion to his good conduct, can any one deny that the good
condition of the horses, as well as that of the coachman, is due to me? So the question seems
to me to be not, whether soul and body is man, or the soul only, or the body only, but what
gives perfection to the soul; for when this is obtained, a man cannot but be either perfect,
or at least much better than in the absence of this one thing.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="62"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—Virtue Gives Perfection to the Soul; The Soul Obtains Virtue by Following
God; Following God is the Happy Life.</head>
<p>9. No one will question that virtue gives perfection to the soul. But it is a very proper
subject of inquiry whether this virtue can exist by itself or only in the soul. Here again arises
a profound discussion, needing lengthy treatment; but perhaps my summary will serve the
purpose. God will, I trust, assist me, so that, notwithstanding our feebleness, we may give
instruction on these great matters briefly as well as intelligibly. In either case, whether virtue
can exist by itself without the soul, or can exist only in the soul, undoubtedly in the pursuit
of virtue the soul follows after something, and this must be either the soul itself, or virtue,
or something else. But if the soul follows after itself in the pursuit of virtue, it follows after
a foolish thing; for before obtaining virtue it is foolish. Now the height of a follower’s desire
is to reach that which he follows after. So the soul must either not wish to reach what it
follows after, which is utterly absurd and unreasonable, or, in following after itself while
foolish, it reaches the folly which it flees from. But if it follows after virtue in the desire to
reach it, how can it follow what does not exist? or how can it desire to reach what it already
possesses? Either, therefore, virtue exists beyond the soul, or if we are not allowed to give
the name of virtue except to the habit and disposition of the wise soul, which can exist only
in the soul, we must allow that the soul follows after something else in order that virtue may
be produced in itself; for neither by following after nothing, nor by following after folly, can
the soul, according to my reasoning, attain to wisdom.</p>
<p>10. This something else then, by following after which the soul becomes possessed of
virtue and wisdom, is either a wise man or God. But we have said already that it must be
something that we cannot lose against our will. No one can think it necessary to ask
whether a wise man, supposing we are content to follow after him, can be taken from us in
spite of our unwillingness or our persistence. God then remains, in following after whom
we live well, and in reaching whom we live both well and happily. If any deny God’s existence,
why should I consider the method of dealing with them, when it is doubtful whether
they ought to be dealt with at all? At any rate, it would require a different starting-point, a
different plan, a different investigation from what we are now engaged in. I am now addressing
those who do not deny the existence of God, and who, moreover, allow that human affairs
are not disregarded by Him. For there is no one, I suppose, who makes any profession of
religion but will hold that divine Providence cares at least for our souls.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—The Knowledge of God to Be Obtained from the Scripture. The Plan
and Principal Mysteries of the Divine Scheme of Redemption.</head>
<p>11. But how can we follow after Him whom we do not see? or how can we see Him, we
who are not only men, but also men of weak understanding? For though God is seen not
with the eyes but with the mind, where can such a mind be found as shall, while obscured
by foolishness, succeed or even attempt to drink in that light? We must therefore have recourse
to the instructions of those whom we have reason to think wise. Thus far argument
brings us. For in human things reasoning is employed, not as of greater certainty, but as
easier from use. But when we come to divine things, this faculty turns away; it cannot behold;
it pants, and gasps, and burns with desire; it falls back from the light of truth, and turns
again to its wonted obscurity, not from choice, but from exhaustion. What a dreadful
catastrophe is this, that the soul should be reduced to greater helplessness when it is seeking
rest from its toil! So, when we are hasting to retire into darkness, it will be well that by the
appointment of adorable Wisdom we should be met by the friendly shade of authority, and
should be attracted by the wonderful character of its contents, and by the utterances of its
pages, which, like shadows, typify and attemper the truth.</p>
<p>12. What more could have been done for our salvation? What can be more gracious
and bountiful than divine providence, which, when man had fallen from its laws, and, in
just retribution for his coveting mortal things, had brought forth a mortal offspring, still
did not wholly abandon him? For in this most righteous government, whose ways are
strange and inscrutable, there is, by means of unknown connections established in the
creatures subject to it, both a severity of punishment and a mercifulness of salvation. How
beautiful this is, how great, how worthy of God, in fine, how true, which is all we are seeking
for, we shall never be able to perceive, unless, beginning with things human and at hand,
and holding by the faith and the precepts of true religion, we continue without turning from
it in the way which God has secured for us by the separation of the patriarchs, by the bond
of the law, by the foresight of the prophets, by the witness of the apostles, by the blood of
the martyrs, and by the subjugation of the Gentiles. From this point, then, let no one ask
me for my opinion, but let us rather hear the oracles, and submit our weak inferences to the
announcements of Heaven.48</p>

<p>13. Let us see how the Lord Himself in the gospel has taught us to live; how, too, Paul
the apostle,—for the Manichæans dare not reject these Scriptures. Let us hear, O Christ,
what chief end Thou dost prescribe to us; and that is evidently the chief end after which we
are told to strive with supreme affection. "Thou shalt love," He says, "the Lord thy God."
Tell me also, I pray Thee, what must be the measure of love; for I fear lest the desire enkindled
in my heart should either exceed or come short in fervor. "With all thy heart," He says. Nor
is that enough. "With all thy soul." Nor is it enough yet. "With all thy mind."49 What do
you wish more? I might, perhaps, wish more if I could see the possibility of more. What
does Paul say on this? "We know," he says, "that all things issue in good to them that love
God." Let him, too, say what is the measure of love. "Who then," he says, "shall separate us
from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,
or peril, or the sword?"50 We have heard, then, what and how much we must love; this we
must strive after, and to this we must refer all our plans. The perfection of all our good
things and our perfect good is God. We must neither come short of this nor go beyond it:
the one is dangerous, the other impossible.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—Harmony of the Old and New Testament on the Precepts of Charity.51</head>
<p>14. Come now, let us examine, or rather let us take notice,—for it is obvious and can
be seen, at once,—whether the authority of the Old Testament too agrees with those statements
taken from the gospel and the apostle. What need to speak of the first statement,
when it is clear to all that it is a quotation from the law given by Moses? For it is there
written, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with
all thy mind." 52 And not to go farther for a passage of the Old Testament to compare with
that of the apostle, he has himself added one. For after saying that no tribulation, no distress,
no persecution, no pressure of bodily want, no peril, no sword, separates us from the love
of Christ, he immediately adds, "As it is written, For Thy sake we are in suffering all the day
long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."53 The Manichæans are in the habit of
saying that this is an interpolation,—so unable are they to reply, that they are forced in their
extremity to say this. But every one can see that this is all that is left for men to say when it
is proved that they are wrong.</p>
<p>15. And yet I ask them if they deny that this is said in the Old Testament, or if they hold
that the passage in the Old Testament does not agree with that of the apostle. For the first,
the books will prove it; and as for the second, those prevaricators who fly off at a tangent
will be brought to agree with me, if they will only reflect a little and consider what is said,
or else I will press upon them the opinion of those who judge impartially. For what could
agree more harmoniously than these passages? For tribulation, distress, persecution, famine,
nakedness, peril, cause great suffering to man while in this life. So all these words are implied
in the single quotation from the law, where it is said, "For Thy sake we are in suffering."54
The only other thing is the sword, which does not inflict a painful life, but removes whatever
life it meets with. Answering to this are the words, "We are accounted as sheep for the

with them. For the reading of the other manuscripts has a different meaning: not, we suffer, but we suffer
death, or, in one word, we are killed. That this is the true reading is shown by the Greek text of the Septuagint,
from which the Old Testament was translated into Latin. I have indeed made a good many remarks on the
words, ‘For thy sake we suffer,’ and the things said are not wrong in themselves; but, as regards the harmony of
the Old and New Testaments, this case certainly does not prove it. The error originated in the way mentioned

it does not harmonize with the apostle? And if you dare not say either of these things (for
you are shut up by the reading of the manuscript, which will show that it is written, and by
common sense, which sees that nothing could agree better with what is said by the apostle),

And once more, what will you reply to a man who says to you, This is what I understand,

in them agrees with the Christian faith? Or tell me at once if you will venture deliberately
to tell me to the face that we are not to believe that the apostles and martyrs are spoken of
as having endured great sufferings for Christ’s sake, and as having been accounted by their
persecutors as sheep for the slaughter? If you cannot say this, why should you bring a charge

<head>Chapter 10.—What the Church Teaches About God. The Two Gods of the
Manichæans.</head>
<p>16. Will you say that you grant that we are bound to love God, but not the God worshipped
by those who acknowledge the authority of the Old Testament? In that case you
refuse to worship the God who made heaven and earth, for this is the God set forth all
through these books. And you admit that the whole of the world, which is called heaven
and earth, had God and a good God for its author and maker. For in speaking to you about
God we must make a distinction. For you hold that there are two gods, one good and the
other bad.</p>
<p>But if you say that you worship and approve of worshipping the God who made heaven
and earth, but not the God supported by the authority of the Old Testament, you act impertinently
in trying, though vainly, to attribute to us views and opinions altogether unlike the
wholesome and profitable doctrine we really hold. Nor can your silly and profane discourses
be at all compared with the expositions in which learned and pious men of the Catholic
Church open up those Scriptures to the willing and worthy. Our understanding of the law
and the prophets is quite different from what you suppose. Mistake us no longer. We do
not worship a God who repents, or is envious, or needy, or cruel, or who takes pleasure in
the blood of men or beasts, or is pleased with guilt and crime, or whose possession of the
earth is limited to a little corner of it. These and such like are the silly notions you are in
the habit of denouncing at great length. Your denunciation does not touch us. The fancies
of old women or of children you attack with a vehemence that is only ridiculous. Any one
whom you persuade in this way to join you shows no fault in the teaching of the Church,
but only proves his own ignorance of it.</p>
<p>17. If, then, you have any human feeling,—if you have any regard for your own welfare,—
you should rather examine with diligence and piety the meaning of these passages
of Scripture. You should examine, unhappy beings that you are; for we condemn with no
less severity and copiousness any faith which attributes to God what is unbecoming Him,
and in those by whom these passages are literally understood we correct the mistake of ignorance,
and look upon persistence in it as absurd. And in many other things which you
cannot understand there is in the Catholic teaching a check on the belief of those who have
got beyond mental childishness, not in years, but in knowledge and understanding—old in
the progress towards wisdom. For we learn the folly of believing that God is bounded by
any amount of space, even though infinite; and it is held unlawful to think of God, or any
part of Him, as moving from one place to another. And should any one suppose that anything
in God’s substance or nature can suffer change or conversion, he will be held guilty of wild
profanity. There are thus among us children who think of God as having a human form,
which they suppose He really has, which is a most degrading idea; and there are many of
full age to whose mind the majesty of God appears in its inviolableness and unchangeableness

<pb n="68"/>
as not only above the human body, but above their own mind itself. These ages, as we said,
are distinguished not by time, but by virtue and discretion.55 Among you, again, there is
no one who will picture God in a human form; but neither is there one who sets God apart
from the contamination of human error. As regards those who are fed like crying babies
at the breast of the Catholic Church, if they are not carried off by heretics, they are nourished
according to the vigor and capacity of each, and arrive at last, one in one way and another
in another, first to a perfect man, and then to the maturity and hoary hairs of wisdom, when
they may get life as they desire, and life in perfect happiness.</p>

with the meaning of the Apostle is evident.—A.H.N.]</note>

<head>Chapter 11.—God is the One Object of Love; Therefore He is Man’s Chief Good.
Nothing is Better Than God. God Cannot Be Lost Against Our Will.</head>
<p>18. Following after God is the desire of happiness; to reach God is happiness itself. We
follow after God by loving Him; we reach Him, not by becoming entirely what He is, but
in nearness to Him, and in wonderful and immaterial contact with Him, and in being inwardly
illuminated and occupied by His truth and holiness. He is light itself; we get enlightenment
from Him. The greatest commandment, therefore, which leads to happy life, and
the first, is this: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and soul, and mind."
For to those who love the Lord all things issue in good. Hence Paul adds shortly after, "I
am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor virtue, nor things present, nor
things future, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."56 If, then, to those who love God all
things issue in good, and if, as no one doubts, the chief or perfect good is not only to be
loved, but to be loved so that nothing shall be loved better, as is expressed in the words,
"With all thy soul, with all thy heart, and with all thy mind," who, I ask, will not at once
conclude, when these things are all settled and most surely believed, that our chief good
which we must hasten to arrive at in preference to all other things is nothing else than God?
And then, if nothing can separate us from His love, must not this be surer as well as better
than any other good?</p>
<p>19. But let us consider the points separately. No one separates us from this by threatening
death. For that with which we love God cannot die, except in not loving God; for
death is not to love God, and that is when we prefer anything to Him in affection and pursuit.
No one separates us from this in promising life; for no one separates us from the fountain
in promising water. Angels do not separate us; for the mind cleaving to God is not inferior
in strength to an angel. Virtue does not separate us; for if what is here called virtue is that
which has power in this world, the mind cleaving to God is far above the whole world. Or
if this virtue is perfect rectitude of our mind itself, this in the case of another will favor our
union with God, and in ourselves will itself unite us with God. Present troubles do not
separate us; for we feel their burden less the closer we cling to Him from whom they try to
separate us. The promise of future things does not separate us; for both future good of every
kind is surest in the promise of God, and nothing is better than God Himself, who undoubtedly
is already present to those who truly cleave to Him. Height and depth do not
separate us; for if the height and depth of knowledge are what is meant, I will rather not be
inquisitive than be separated from God; nor can any instruction by which error is removed
separate me from Him, by separation from whom it is that any one is in error. Or if what
is meant are the higher and lower parts of this world, how can the promise of heaven separate

me from Him who made heaven? Or who from beneath can frighten me into forsaking
God, when I should not have known of things beneath but by forsaking Him? In fine, what
place can remove me from His love, when He could not be all in every place unless He were
contained in none?</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—We are United to God by Love, in Subjection to Him.</head>
<p>20. "No other creature," he says, separates us. O man of profound mysteries! He thought
it not enough to say, no creature: but he says no other creature; teaching that with which
we love God and by which we cleave to God, our mind, namely, and understanding, is itself
a creature. Thus the body is another creature; and if the mind is an object of intellectual
perception, and is known only by this means, the other creature is all that is an object of
sense, which as it were makes itself known through the eyes, or ears, or smell, or taste, or
touch, and this must be inferior to what is perceived by the intellect alone. Now, as God
also can be known by the worthy, only intellectually,57 exalted though He is above the intelligent
mind as being its Creator and Author, there was danger lest the human mind, from
being reckoned among invisible and immaterial things, should be thought to be of the same
nature with Him who created it, and so should fall away by pride from Him to whom it
should be united by love. For the mind becomes like God, to the extent vouchsafed by its
subjection of itself to Him for information and enlightenment. And if it obtains the greatest
nearness by that subjection which produces likeness, it must be far removed from Him by
that presumption which would make the likeness greater. It is this presumption which leads
the mind to refuse obedience to the laws of God, in the desire to be sovereign, as God is.</p>
<p>21. The farther, then, the mind departs from God, not in space, but in affection and
lust after things below Him, the more it is filled with folly and wretchedness. So by love it
returns to God,—a love which places it not along with God, but under Him. And the more
ardor and eagerness there is in this, the happier and more elevated will the mind be, and
with God as sole governor it will be in perfect liberty. Hence it must know that it is a
creature. It must believe what is the truth,—that its Creator remains ever possessed of the
inviolable and immutable nature of truth and wisdom, and must confess, even in view of
the errors from which it desires deliverance, that it is liable to folly and falsehood. But then
again, it must take care that it be not separated by the love of the other creature, that is, of
this visible world, from the love of God Himself, which sanctifies it in order to lasting hap-
piness. No other creature, then,—for we are ourselves a creature,—separates us from the
love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—We are Joined Inseparably to God by Christ and His Spirit.</head>
<p>22. Let this same Paul tell us who is this Christ Jesus our Lord. "To them that are called,"
he says, "we preach Christ the virtue of God, and the wisdom of God."58 And does not
Christ Himself say, "I am the truth?"59 If, then, we ask what it is to live well,—that is, to
strive after happiness by living well,—it must assuredly be to love virtue, to love wisdom,
to love truth, and to love with all the heart, with all the soul, and with all the mind; virtue
which is inviolable and immutable, wisdom which never gives place to folly, truth which
knows no change or variation from its uniform character. Through this the Father Himself
is seen; for it is said, "No man cometh unto the Father but by me." To this we cleave by
sanctification. For when sanctified we burn with full and perfect love, which is the only security
for our not turning away from God, and for our being conformed to Him rather than
to this world; for "He has predestinated us," says the same apostle, "that we should be conformed
to the image of His Son."60 </p>
<p>23. It is through love, then, that we become conformed to God; and by this conformation,
and configuration, and circumcision from this world we are not confounded with the things
which are properly subject to us. And this is done by the Holy Spirit. "For hope," he says,
"does not confound us; for the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit,
which is given unto us."61 But we could not possibly be restored to perfection by the Holy
Spirit, unless He Himself continued always perfect and immutable. And this plainly could
not be unless He were of the nature and of the very substance of God, who alone is always
possessed of immutability and invariableness. "The creature," it is affirmed, not by me but
by Paul, "has been made subject to vanity."62 And what is subject to vanity is unable to
separate us from vanity, and to unite us to the truth. But the Holy Spirit does this for us.
He is therefore no creature. For whatever is, must be either God or the creature.</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—We Cleave to the Trinity, Our Chief Good, by Love.</head>
<p>24. We ought then to love God, the Trinity in unity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; for
this must be said to be God Himself, for it is said of God, truly and in the most exalted sense,
"Of whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things." Those are Paul’s
words. And what does he add? "To Him be glory."63 All this is exactly true. He does not
say, To them; for God is one. And what is meant by, To Him be glory, but to Him be chief
and perfect and widespread praise? For as the praise improves and extends, so the love and
affection increases in fervor. And when this is the case, mankind cannot but advance with
sure and firm step to a life of perfection and bliss. This, I suppose, is all we wish to find
when we speak of the chief good of man, to which all must be referred in life and conduct.
For the good plainly exists; and we have shown by reasoning, as far as we were able, and by
the divine authority which goes beyond our reasoning, that it is nothing else but God
Himself. For how can any thing be man’s chief good but that in cleaving to which he is
blessed? Now this is nothing but God, to whom we can cleave only by affection, desire, and
love.</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—The Christian Definition of the Four Virtues.</head>
<p>25. As to virtue leading us to a happy life, I hold virtue to be nothing else than perfect
love of God. For the fourfold division of virtue I regard as taken from four forms of love.
For these four virtues (would that all felt their influence in their minds as they have their
names in their mouths!), I should have no hesitation in defining them: that temperance is
love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things
for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore
ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and
what helps it. The object of this love is not anything, but only God, the chief good, the
highest wisdom, the perfect harmony. So we may express the definition thus: that temperance
is love keeping itself entire and incorrupt for God; fortitude is love bearing everything
readily for the sake of God; justice is love serving God only, and therefore ruling well all
else, as subject to man; prudence is love making a right distinction between what helps it
towards God and what might hinder it.64</p>
<note type="footnote">64 [It would be difficult to find in Christian literature a more beautiful and satisfactory exposition of love to
God. The Neo-Platonic influence is manifest, but it is Neo-Platonism thoroughly Christianized.—A.H.N.]</note>

<head>Chapter 16.—Harmony of the Old and New Testaments.</head>
<p>26. I will briefly set forth the manner of life according to these virtues, one by one, after
I have brought forward, as I promised, passages from the Old Testament parallel to those I
have been quoting from the New Testament. For is Paul alone in saying that we should be
joined to God so that there should be nothing between to separate us? Does not the
prophet say the same most aptly and concisely in the words, "It is good for me to cleave to
God?" 65 Does not this one word cleave express all that the apostle says at length about
love? And do not the words, It is good, point to the apostle’s statement, "All things issue in
good to them that love God?" Thus in one clause and in two words the prophet sets forth
the power and the fruit of love.</p>
<p>27. And as the apostle says that the Son of God is the virtue of God and the wisdom of
God,—virtue being understood to refer to action, and wisdom to teaching (as in the gospel
these two things are expressed in the words, "All things were made by Him," which belongs
to action and virtue; and then, referring to teaching and the knowledge of the truth, he says,
"The life was the light of men"66),—could anything agree better with these passages than
what is said in the Old Testament67 of wisdom, "She reaches from end to end in strength,
and orders all things sweetly?" For reaching in strength expresses virtue, while ordering
sweetly expresses skill and method. But if this seems obscure, see what follows: "And of
all," he says, "God loved her; for she teaches the knowledge of God, and chooses His works."
Nothing more is found here about action; for choosing works is not the same as working,
so this refers to teaching. There remains action to correspond with the virtue, to complete
the truth we wish to prove. Read then what comes next: "But if," he says, "the possession
which is desired in life is honorable, what is more honorable than wisdom, which works all
things?" Could anything be brought forward more striking or more distinct than this, or
even more fully expressed? Or, if you wish more, hear another passage of the same meaning.
"Wisdom," he says, "teaches sobriety, and justice, and virtue." 68 Sobriety refers, I think, to
the knowledge of the truth, or to teaching; justice and virtue to work and action. And I
know nothing comparable to these two things, that is, to efficiency in action and sobriety
in contemplation, which the virtue of God and the wisdom of God, that is, the Son of God,
gives to them that love Him, when the same prophet goes on to show their value; for it is
<note type="footnote">65 Ps. lxxiii. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">66 John i. 3, 4.</note>

<pb n="76"/>
thus stated: "Wisdom teaches sobriety, and justice, and virtue, than which nothing is more
useful in life to man."69</p>
<p>28. Perhaps some may think that those passages do not refer to the Son of God. What,
then, is taught in the following words: "She displays the nobility of her birth, having her
dwelling with God?"70 To what does birth refer but to parentage? And does not dwelling
with the Father claim and assert equality? Again, as Paul says that the Son of God is the
wisdom of God,71 and as the Lord Himself says, "No man knoweth the Father save the onlybegotten
Son,"72 what could be more concordant than those words of the prophet: "With
Thee is wisdom which knows Thy works, which was present at the time of Thy making the
world, and knew what would be pleasing in Thine eyes?"73 And as Christ is called the truth,
which is also taught by His being called the brightness of the Father74 (for there is nothing
round about the sun but its brightness which is produced from it), what is there in the Old
Testament more plainly and obviously in accordance with this than the words, "Thy truth
is round about Thee?"75 Once more, Wisdom herself says in the gospel, "No man cometh
unto the Father but by me;"76 and the prophet says, "Who knoweth Thy mind, unless Thou
givest wisdom?" and a little after, "The things pleasing to Thee men have learned, and have
been healed by wisdom."77</p>
<p>29. Paul says, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which
is given unto us;"78 and the prophet says, "The Holy Spirit of knowledge will shun guile."79
<note type="footnote">69 Retract. i. 7, § 3:—"The quotation from the book of Wisdom is from my manuscript, where the reading

sobriety; and excellence of action, which is the meaning I give to justice and virtue. And the reading in
better manuscripts has the same meaning: ‘It teaches sobriety, and wisdom, and justice, and virtue.’ These are
the names given by the Latin translator to the four virtues which philosophers usually speak about. Sobriety is
for temperance, wisdom for prudence, virtue for fortitude, and justice only has its own name. It was long after
that we found these virtues called by their proper names in the Greek text of this book of Wisdom."</note>

For where there is guile there is no love. Paul says that we are "conformed to the image of

prophet says, "Thou sendest Thy Spirit from the higher."82 For God alone is the highest,
than whom nothing is higher. Paul shows that the Trinity is one God, when he says, "To

<p>30. What more do you wish? Why do you resist ignorantly and obstinately? Why do
you pervert untutored minds by your mischievous teaching? The God of both Testaments
is one. For as there is an agreement in the passages quoted from both, so is there in all the
rest, if you are willing to consider them carefully and impartially. But because many expressions
are undignified, and so far adapted to minds creeping on the earth, that they may rise
by human things to divine,85 while many are figurative, that the inquiring mind may have
the more profit from the exertion of finding their meaning, and the more delight when it
is found, you pervert this admirable arrangement of the Holy Spirit for the purpose of deceiving
and ensnaring your followers. As to the reason why divine Providence permits you
to do this, and as to the truth of the apostle’s saying, "There must needs be many heresies,
that they which are approved may be made manifest among you,"86 it would take long to
discuss these things, and you, with whom we have now to do, are not capable of understanding
them. I know you well. To the consideration of divine things, which are far higher than
you suppose, you bring minds quite gross and sickly, from being fed with material images.</p>
<p>31. We must therefore in your case try not to make you understand divine things, which
is impossible, but to make you desire to understand. This is the work of the pure and
guileless love of God, which is seen chiefly in the conduct, and of which we have already
said much. This love, inspired by the Holy Spirit, leads to the Son, that is, to the wisdom
of God, by which the Father Himself is known. For if wisdom and truth are not sought for
with the whole strength of the mind, it cannot possibly be found. But when it is sought as
it deserves to be, it cannot withdraw or hide itself from its lovers. Hence its words, which
you too are in the habit of repeating, "Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you:"87 "Nothing is hid which shall not be revealed."88 It is love
that asks, love that seeks, love that knocks, love that reveals, love, too, that gives continuance
in what is revealed. From this love of wisdom, and this studious inquiry, we are not debarred
by the Old Testament, as you always say most falsely, but are exhorted to this with the
greatest urgency.</p>
<p>32. Hear, then, at length, and consider, I pray you, what is said by the prophet: "Wisdom
is glorious, and never fadeth away; yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found

of such as seek her. She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto
them. Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail; for he shall find her sitting at his
doors. To think, therefore, upon her is perfection of wisdom; and whoso watcheth for her
shall quickly be without care. For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, showeth
herself favorably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought. For the very
true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love; and love
is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption;
and incorruption maketh us near unto God. Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a
kingdom." 89 Will you still continue in dogged hostility to these things? Do not things thus
stated, though not yet understood, make it evident to every one that they contain something
deep and unutterable? Would that you could understand the things here said! Forthwith

expound and prove the truths I have learned, which are generally more excellent and lofty
than words can express; but this cannot be done while you bark at it. For not in vain is it
said, "Give not that which is holy to dogs."90 Do not be angry. I too barked and was a dog;
and then, as was right, instead of the food of teaching, I got the rod of correction. But were
there in you that love of which we are speaking, or should it ever be in you as much as the
greatness of the truth to be known requires, may God vouchsafe to show you that neither
is there among the Manichæans the Christian faith which leads to the summit of wisdom
and truth, the attainment of which is the true happy life, nor is it anywhere but in the
Catholic teaching. Is not this what the Apostle Paul appears to desire when he says, "For
this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole
family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant unto you, according to the riches
of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man: that Christ may
dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to
comprehend with all saints what is the height, and length, and breadth, and depth, and to
know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fullness
of God?"91 Could anything be more plainly expressed?</p>
<p>34. Wake up a little, I beseech you, and see the harmony of both Testaments, making
it quite plain and certain what should be the manner of life in our conduct, and to what all
things should be referred. To the love of God we are incited by the gospel, when it is said,
"Ask, seek, knock;"92 by Paul, when he says, "That ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
may be able to comprehend;"93 by the prophet also, when he says that wisdom can easily
be known by those who love it, seek for it, desire it, watch for it, think about it, care for it.
The salvation of the mind94 and the way of happiness is pointed out by the concord of both
Scriptures; and yet you choose rather to bark at these things than to obey them. I will tell

<head>Chapter 19.—Description of the Duties of Temperance, According to the Sacred
Scriptures.</head>
<p>35. It is now time to return to the four virtues, and to draw out and prescribe a way of
life in conformity with them, taking each separately. First, then, let us consider temperance,
which promises us a kind of integrity and incorruption in the love by which we are united
to God. The office of temperance is in restraining and quieting the passions which make
us pant for those things which turn us away from the laws of God and from the enjoyment
of His goodness, that is, in a word, from the happy life. For there is the abode of truth; and
in enjoying its contemplation, and in cleaving closely to it, we are assuredly happy; but departing
from this, men become entangled in great errors and sorrows. For, as the apostle
says, "The root of all evils is covetousness; which some having followed, have made shipwreck
of the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows."96 And this sin of
the soul is quite plainly, to those rightly understanding, set forth in the Old Testament in
the transgression of Adam in Paradise. Thus, as the apostle says, "In Adam we all die, and
in Christ we shall all rise again."97 Oh, the depth of these mysteries! But I refrain; for I am
now engaged not in teaching you the truth, but in making you unlearn your errors, if I can,
that is, if God aid my purpose regarding you.</p>
<p>36. Paul then says that covetousness is the root of all evils; and by covetousness the old
law also intimates that the first man fell. Paul tells us to put off the old man and put on the
new.98 By the old man he means Adam who sinned, and by the new man him whom the
Son of God took to Himself in consecration for our redemption. For he says in another
place, "The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven, heavenly. As
is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also
that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image
of the heavenly," 99—that is, put off the old man, and put on the new. The whole duty of
temperance, then, is to put off the old man, and to be renewed in God,—that is, to scorn all
bodily delights, and the popular applause, and to turn the whole love to things divine and
unseen. Hence that following passage which is so admirable: "Though our outward man
perish, our inward man is renewed day by day."100 Hear, too, the prophet singing, "Create

<head>Chapter 20.—We are Required to Despise All Sensible Things, and to Love God
Alone.</head>
<p>37. Bodily delights have their source in all those things with which the bodily sense
comes in contact, and which are by some called the objects of sense; and among these the
noblest is light, in the common meaning of the word, because among our senses also, which
the mind uses in acting through the body, there is nothing more valuable than the eyes, and
so in the Holy Scriptures all the objects of sense are spoken of as visible things. Thus in the
New Testament we are warned against the love of these things in the following words:
"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for
the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."102
This shows how far from being Christians those are who hold that the sun and moon are
to be not only loved but worshipped. For what is seen if the sun and moon are not? But
we are forbidden to regard things which are seen. The man, therefore, who wishes to offer
that incorrupt love to God must not love these things too. This subject I will inquire into
more particularly elsewhere. Here my plan is to write not of faith, but of the life by which
we become worthy of knowing what we believe. God then alone is to be loved; and all this
world, that is, all sensible things, are to be despised,—while, however, they are to be used
as this life requires.</p>

<head>Chapter 21.—Popular Renown and Inquisitiveness are Condemned in the Sacred
Scriptures.</head>
<p>38. Popular renown is thus slighted and scorned in the New Testament: "If I wished,"
says St. Paul, "to please men, I should not be the servant of Christ."103 Again, there is another
production of the soul formed by imaginations derived from material things, and called the
knowledge of things. In reference to this we are fitly warned against inquisitiveness to correct
which is the great function of temperance. Thus it is said, "Take heed lest any one seduce
you by philosophy." And because the word philosophy originally means the love and pursuit
of wisdom, a thing of great value and to be sought with the whole mind, the apostle, with
great prudence, that he might not be thought to deter from the love of wisdom, has added
the words, "And the elements of this world."104 For some people, neglecting virtues, and
ignorant of what God is, and of the majesty of nature which remains always the same, think
that they are engaged in an important business when searching with the greatest inquisitiveness
and eagerness into this material mass which we call the world. This begets so much
pride, that they look upon themselves as inhabitants of the heaven of which they often discourse.
The soul, then, which purposes to keep itself chaste for God must refrain from the
desire of vain knowledge like this. For this desire usually produces delusion, so that the
soul thinks that nothing exists but what is material; or if, from regard to authority, it confesses
that there is an immaterial existence, it can think of it only under material images, and has
no belief regarding it but that imposed by the bodily sense. We may apply to this the precept
about fleeing from idolatry.</p>
<p>39. To this New Testament authority, requiring us not to love anything in this world,105
especially in that passage where it is said, "Be not conformed to this world,"106—for the
point is to show that a man is conformed to whatever he loves,—to this authority, then, if
I seek for a parallel passage in the Old Testament, I find several; but there is one book of
Solomon, called Ecclesiastes, which at great length brings all earthly things into utter contempt.
The book begins thus: "Vanity of the vain, saith the Preacher, vanity of the vain; all
is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun?" 107 If all
these words are considered, weighed, and thoroughly examined, many things are found of
essential importance to those who seek to flee from the world and to take shelter in God;
but this requires time and our discourse hastens on to other topics. But, after this beginning,

he goes on to show in detail that the vain108 are those who are deceived by things of this
sort; and he calls this which deceives them vanity,—not that God did not create those things,
but because men choose to subject themselves by their sins to those things, which the divine
law has made subject to them in well-doing. For when you consider things beneath your
self to be admirable and desirable, what is this but to be cheated and misled by unreal goods?
The man, then, who is temperate in such mortal and transient things has his rule of life
confirmed by both Testaments, that he should love none of these things, nor think them
desirable for their own sakes, but should use them as far as is required for the purposes and
duties of life, with the moderation of an employer instead of the ardor of a lover. These remarks
on temperance are few in proportion to the greatness of the theme, but perhaps too
many in view of the task on hand.</p>
<note type="footnote">108 Retract. i. 7, § 3: —"I found in many manuscripts the reading, ‘Vanity of the vain.’ But this is not in the

vanities and not vain. But the truths I have drawn from this false reading are self-evident."</note>

<head>Chapter 22.—Fortitude Comes from the Love of God.</head>
<p>40. On fortitude we must be brief. The love, then, of which we speak, which ought with
all sanctity to burn in desire for God, is called temperance, in not seeking for earthly things,
and fortitude in bearing the loss of them. But among all things which are possessed in this
life, the body is, by God’s most righteous laws, for the sin of old, man’s heaviest bond, which
is well known as a fact but most incomprehensible in its mystery. Lest this bond should be
shaken and disturbed, the soul is shaken with the fear of toil and pain; lest it should be lost
and destroyed, the soul is shaken with the fear of death. For the soul loves it from the force
of habit, not knowing that by using it well and wisely its resurrection and reformation will,
by the divine help and decree, be without any trouble made subject to its authority. But
when the soul turns to God wholly in this love, it knows these things, and so will not only
disregard death, but will even desire it.</p>
<p>41. Then there is the great struggle with pain. But there is nothing, though of iron
hardness, which the fire of love cannot subdue. And when the mind is carried up to God
in this love, it will soar above all torture free and glorious, with wings beauteous and unhurt,
on which chaste love rises to the embrace of God. Otherwise God must allow the lovers of
gold, the lovers of praise, the lovers of women, to have more fortitude than the lovers of
Himself, though love in those cases is rather to be called passion or lust. And yet even here
we may see with what force the mind presses on with unflagging energy, in spite of all alarms,
towards that it loves; and we learn that we should bear all things rather than forsake God,
since those men bear so much in order to forsake Him.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">
<pb n="88"/>
<head>Chapter 23.—Scripture Precepts and Examples of Fortitude.</head>
<p>42. Instead of quoting here authorities from the New Testament, where it is said,
"Tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience and experience, hope;"109 and
where, in addition to these words, there is proof and confirmation of them from the example
of those who spoke them; I will rather summon an example of patience from the Old Testament,
against which the Manichæans make fierce assaults. Nor will I refer to the man who,
in the midst of great bodily suffering, and with a dreadful disease in his limbs, not only bore
human evils, but discoursed of things divine. Whoever gives considerate attention to the
utterances of this man, will learn from every one of them what value is to be attached to
those things which men try to keep in their power, and in so doing are themselves brought
by passion into bondage, so that they become the slaves of mortal things, while seeking ignorantly
to be their masters. This man, in the loss of all his wealth, and on being suddenly
reduced to the greatest poverty, kept his mind so unshaken and fixed upon God, as to
manifest that these things were not great in his view, but that he was great in relation to
them, and God to him.110 If this mind were to be found in men in our day, we should not
be so strongly cautioned in the New Testament against the possession of these things in
order that we may be perfect; for to have these things without cleaving to them is much
more admirable than not to have them at all.111</p>
<p>43. But since we are speaking here of bearing pain and bodily sufferings, I pass from
this man, great as he was, indomitable as he was: this is the case of a man. But these Scriptures
present to me a woman of amazing fortitude, and I must at once go on to her case.
This woman, along with seven children, allowed the tyrant and executioner to extract her
vitals from her body rather than a profane word from her mouth, encouraging her sons by
her exhortations, though she suffered in the tortures of their bodies, and was herself to undergo
what she called on them to bear.112 What patience could be greater than this? And
yet why should we be astonished that the love of God, implanted in her inmost heart, bore
up against tyrant, and executioner, and pain, and sex, and natural affection? Had she not
heard, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints?"113 Had she not heard,

<head>Chapter 24.—Of Justice and Prudence.</head>
<p>44. What of justice that pertains to God? As the Lord says, "Ye cannot serve two masters,"
117 and the apostle denounces those who serve the creature rather than the Creator,118
was it not said before in the Old Testament, "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
Him only shalt thou serve?"119 I need say no more on this, for these books are full of such
passages. The lover, then, whom we are describing, will get from justice this rule of life, that
he must with perfect readiness serve the God whom he loves, the highest good, the highest
wisdom, the highest peace;120 and as regards all other things, must either rule them as subject
to himself, or treat them with a view to their subjection. This rule of life, is, as we have
shown, confirmed by the authority of both Testaments.</p>
<p>45. With equal brevity we must treat of prudence, to which it belongs to discern between
what is to be desired and what to be shunned. Without this, nothing can be done of what
we have already spoken of. It is the part of prudence to keep watch with most anxious vigilance,
lest any evil influence should stealthily creep in upon us. Thus the Lord often exclaims,
"Watch;"121 and He says, "Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you."122
And then it is said, "Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?"123 And no
passage can be quoted from the Old Testament more expressly condemning this mental
somnolence, which makes us insensible to destruction advancing on us step by step, than
those words of the prophet, "He who despiseth small things shall fall by degrees."124 On
this topic I might discourse at length did our haste allow of it. And did our present task
demand it, we might perhaps prove the depth of these mysteries, by making a mock of which
profane men in their perfect ignorance fall, not certainly by degrees, but with a headlong
overthrow.</p>

<head>Chapter 25.—Four Moral Duties Regarding the Love of God, of Which Love the
Reward is Eternal Life and the Knowledge of the Truth.</head>
<p>46. I need say no more about right conduct. For if God is man’s chief good, which you
cannot deny, it clearly follows, since to seek the chief good is to live well, that to live well is
nothing else but to love God with all the heart, with all the soul, with all the mind; and, as
arising from this, that this love must be preserved entire and incorrupt, which is the part of
temperance; that it give way before no troubles, which is the part of fortitude; that it serve
no other, which is the part of justice; that it be watchful in its inspection of things lest craft
or fraud steal in, which is the part of prudence. This is the one perfection of man, by which
alone he can succeed in attaining to the purity of truth. This both Testaments enjoin in
concert; this is commended on both sides alike. Why do you continue to cast reproaches
on Scriptures of which you are ignorant? Do you not see the folly of your attack upon books
which only those who do not understand them find fault with, and which only those who
find fault fail in understanding? For neither can an enemy know them, nor can one who
knows them be other than a friend to them.</p>
<p>47. Let us then, as many as have in view to reach eternal life, love God with all the heart,
with all the soul, with all the mind. For eternal life contains the whole reward in the promise
of which we rejoice; nor can the reward precede desert, nor be given to a man before he is
worthy of it. What can be more unjust than this, and what is more just than God? We
should not then demand the reward before we deserve to get it. Here, perhaps, it is not out
of place to ask what is eternal life; or rather let us hear the Bestower of it: "This," He says,
"is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast
sent."125 So eternal life is the knowledge of the truth. See, then, how perverse and preposterous
is the character of those who think that their teaching of the knowledge of God will
make us perfect, when this is the reward of those already perfect! What else, then, have we
to do but first to love with full affection Him whom we desire to know?126 Hence arises
that principle on which we have all along insisted, that there is nothing more wholesome
in the Catholic Church than using authority127 before argument.</p>
<note type="footnote">125 John xvii. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">126 Retract. i. 7. § 4:—"I should have said sincere affection rather than full; or it might be thought that the
love of God will be no greater when we shall see Him face to face. Full, then, must be here understood as
meaning that it cannot be greater while we walk by faith. There will be greater, yea, perfect fullness, but only
by sight."</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
<pb n="92"/>
<head>Chapter 26.—Love of Ourselves and of Our Neighbor.</head>
<p>48. To proceed to what remains. It may be thought that there is nothing here about
man himself, the lover. But to think this, shows a want of clear perception. For it is impossible
for one who loves God not to love himself. For he alone has a proper love for
himself who aims diligently at the attainment of the chief and true good; and if this is
nothing else but God, as has been shown, what is to prevent one who loves God from loving
himself? And then, among men should there be no bond of mutual love? Yea, verily; so
that we can think of no surer step towards the love of God than the love of man to man.</p>
<p>49. Let the Lord then supply us with the other precept in answer to the question about
the precepts of life; for He was not satisfied with one as knowing that God is one thing and
man another, and that the difference is nothing less than that between the Creator and the
thing created in the likeness of its Creator. He says then that the second precept is, "Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."128 Now you love yourself suitably when you love God
better than yourself. What, then, you aim at in yourself you must aim at in your neighbor,
namely, that he may love God with a perfect affection. For you do not love him as yourself,
unless you try to draw him to that good which you are yourself pursuing. For this is the
one good which has room for all to pursue it along with thee. From this precept proceed
the duties of human society, in which it is hard to keep from error. But the first thing to
aim at is, that we should be benevolent, that is, that we cherish no malice and no evil design
against another. For man is the nearest neighbor of man.</p>
<p>50. Hear also what Paul says: "The love of our neighbor," he says, "worketh no ill."129
The testimonies here made use of are very short, but, if I mistake not, they are to the point,
and sufficient for the purpose. And every one knows how many and how weighty are the
words to be found everywhere in these books on the love of our neighbor. But as a man
may sin against another in two ways, either by injuring him or by not helping him when it
is in his power, and as it is for these things which no loving man would do that men are
called wicked, all that is required is, I think, proved by these words, "The love of our neighbor
worketh no ill." And if we cannot attain to good unless we first desist from working evil,
our love of our neighbor is a sort of cradle of our love to God, so that, as it is said, "the love
of our neighbor worketh no ill," we may rise from this to these other words, "We know that
all things issue in good to them that love God."130</p>
<p>51. But there is a sense in which these either rise together to fullness and perfection,
or, while the love of God is first in beginning, the love of our neighbor is first in coming to
perfection. For perhaps divine love takes hold on us more rapidly at the outset, but we reach

<note type="footnote">129 Rom. xiii. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">130 Rom. viii. 28.</note>

<pb n="93"/>
perfection more easily in lower things. However that may be, the main point is this, that
no one should think that while he despises his neighbor he will come to happiness and to
the God whom he loves. And would that it were as easy to seek the good of our neighbor,
or to avoid hurting him, as it is for one well trained and kind-hearted to love his neighbor!
These things require more than mere good-will, and can be done only by a high degree of
thoughtfulness and prudence, which belongs only to those to whom it is given by God, the
source of all good. On this topic—which is one, I think, of great difficulty—I will try to say
a few words such as my plan admits of, resting all my hope in Him whose gifts these are.</p>

<pb n="94"/>
<head>Chapter 27.—On Doing Good to the Body of Our Neighbor.</head>
<p>52. Man, then, as viewed by his fellow-man, is a rational soul with a mortal and earthly
body in its service. Therefore he who loves his neighbor does good partly to the man’s body,
and partly to his soul. What benefits the body is called medicine; what benefits the soul,
discipline. Medicine here includes everything that either preserves or restores bodily health.
It includes, therefore, not only what belongs to the art of medical men, properly so called,
but also food and drink, clothing and shelter, and every means of covering and protection
to guard our bodies against injuries and mishaps from without as well as from within. For
hunger and thirst, and cold and heat, and all violence from without, produce loss of that
health which is the point to be considered.</p>
<p>53. Hence those who seasonably and wisely supply all the things required for warding
off these evils and distresses are called compassionate, although they may have been so wise
that no painful feeling disturbed their mind in the exercise of compassion.131 No doubt
the word compassionate implies suffering in the heart of the man who feels for the sorrow
of another. And it is equally true that a wise man ought to be free from all painful emotion
when he assists the needy, when he gives food to the hungry and water to the thirsty, when
he clothes the naked, when he takes the stranger into his house, when he sets free the oppressed,
when, lastly, he extends his charity to the dead in giving them burial. Still the epithet
compassionate is a proper one, although he acts with tranquillity of mind, not from the
stimulus of painful feeling, but from motives of benevolence. There is no harm in the word
compassionate when there is no passion in the case.</p>
<p>54. Fools, again, who avoid the exercise of compassion as a vice, because they are not
sufficiently moved by a sense of duty without feeling also distressful emotion, are frozen
into hard insensibility, which is very different from the calm of a rational serenity. God, on
the other hand, is properly called compassionate; and the sense in which He is so will be
understood by those whom piety and diligence have made fit to understand. There is a
danger lest, in using the words of the learned, we harden the souls of the unlearned by
leading them away from compassion instead of softening them with the desire of a charitable
disposition. As compassion, then, requires us to ward off these distresses from others, so
harmlessness forbids the infliction of them.</p>
<note type="footnote">131 Retract. i. 7. § 4:—"This does not mean that there are actually in this life wise men such as are here spoken

<head>Chapter 28.—On Doing Good to the Soul of Our Neighbor. Two Parts of Discipline,
Restraint and Instruction. Through Good Conduct We Arrive at the Knowledge
of the Truth.</head>
<p>55. As regards discipline, by which the health of the mind is restored, without which
bodily health avails nothing for security against misery, the subject is one of great difficulty.
And as in the body we said it is one thing to cure diseases and wounds, which few can do
properly, and another thing to meet the cravings of hunger and thirst, and to give assistance
in all the other ways in which any man may at any time help another; so in the mind there
are some things in which the high and rare offices of the teacher are not much called for,—as,
for instance, in advice and exhortation to give to the needy the things already mentioned
as required for the body. To give such advice is to aid the mind by discipline, as giving the
things themselves is aiding the body by our resources. But there are other cases where diseases
of the mind, many and various in kind, are healed in a way strange and indescribable.
Unless His medicine were sent from heaven to men, so heedlessly do they go on in sin, there
would be no hope of salvation; and, indeed, even bodily health, if you go to the root of the
matter, can have come to men from none but God, who gives to all things their being and
their well-being.</p>
<p>56. This discipline, then, which is the medicine of the mind, as far as we can gather
from the sacred Scriptures, includes two things, restraint and instruction. Restraint implies
fear, and instruction love, in the person benefited by the discipline; for in the giver of the
benefit there is the love without the fear. In both of these God Himself, by whose goodness
and mercy it is that we are anything, has given us in the two Testaments a rule of discipline.
For though both are found in both Testaments, still fear is prominent in the Old, and love
in the New; which the apostle calls bondage in the one, and liberty in the other. Of the
marvellous order and divine harmony of these Testaments it would take long to speak, and
many pious and learned men have discoursed on it. The theme demands many books to
set it forth and explain it as far as is possible for man. He, then, who loves his neighbor endeavors
all he can to procure his safety in body and in soul, making the health of the mind
the standard in his treatment of the body. And as regards the mind, his endeavors are in
this order, that he should first fear and then love God. This is true excellence of conduct,
and thus the knowledge of the truth is acquired which we are ever in the pursuit of.</p>
<p>57. The Manichæans agree with me as regards the duty of loving God and our neighbor,
but they deny that this is taught in the Old Testament. How greatly they err in this is, I
think, clearly shown by the passages quoted above on both these duties. But, in a single
word, and one which only stark madness can oppose, do they not see the unreasonableness
of denying that these very two precepts which they commend are quoted by the Lord in the
Gospel from the Old Testament, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and

<pb n="96"/>
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;" and the other, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself?"132 Or if they dare not deny this, from the light of truth being too strong for them,
let them deny that these precepts are salutary; let them deny, if they can, that they teach the
best morality; let them assert that it is not a duty to love God, or to love our neighbor; that
all things do not issue in good to them that love God; that it is not true that the love of our
neighbor worketh no ill (a two-fold regulation of human life which is most salutary and
excellent). By such assertions they cut themselves off not only from Christians, but from
mankind. But if they dare not speak thus, but must confess the divinity of the precepts, why
do they not desist from assailing and maligning with horrible profanity the books from
which they are quoted?</p>
<p>58. Will they say, as they often do, that although we find these precepts in the books,
it does not follow that all is good that is found there? How to meet and refute this quibble
I do not well see. Shall I discuss the words of the Old Testament one by one, to prove to
stubborn and ignorant men their perfect agreement with the New Testament? But when
will this be done? When shall I have time, or they patience? What, then, is to be done?
Shall I desert the cause, and leave them to escape detection in an opinion which, though
false and impious, is hard to disprove? I will not. God will Himself be at hand to aid me;
nor will He suffer me in those straits to remain helpless or forsaken.</p>

<head>Chapter 29.—Of the Authority of the Scriptures.</head>
<p>59. Attend, then, ye Manichæans, if perchance there are some of you of whom your
superstition has hold so as to allow you yet to escape. Attend, I say, without obstinacy,
without the desire to oppose, otherwise your decision will be fatal to yourselves. No one
can doubt, and you are not so lost to the truth as not to understand that if it is good, as all
allow, to love God and our neighbor, whatever hangs on these two precepts cannot rightly
be pronounced bad. What it is that hangs on them it would be absurd to think of learning
from me. Hear Christ Himself; hear Christ, I say; hear the Wisdom of God: "On these two
commandments," He says, "hang all the law and the prophets."133</p>
<p>60. What can the most shameless obstinacy say to this? That these are not Christ’s
words? But they are written in the Gospel as His words. That the writing is false? Is not
this most profane blasphemy? Is it not most presumptuous to speak thus? Is it not most
foolhardy? Is it not most criminal? The worshippers of idols, who hate even the name of
Christ, never dared to speak thus against these Scriptures. For the utter overthrow of all
literature will follow, and there will be an end to all books handed down from the past, if
what is supported by such a strong popular belief and established by the uniform testimony
of so many men and so many times, is brought into such suspicion, that it is not allowed to
have the credit and the authority of common history. In fine, what can you quote from any
writings of which I may not speak in this way if it is quoted against my opinion and my
purpose?134</p>
<p>61. And is it not intolerable that they forbid us to believe a book widely known and
placed now in the hands of all, while they insist on our believing the book which they quote?
If any writing is to be suspected, what should be more so than one which has not merited
notoriety, or which may be throughout a forgery, bearing a false name? If you force such
a writing on me against my will, and make a display of authority to drive me into belief,
shall I, when I have a writing which I see spread far and wide for a length of time, and

<p>62. But why say more on this? For who but sees that men who dare to speak thus against
the Christian Scriptures, though they may not be what they are suspected of being, are at
least no Christians? For to Christians this rule of life is given, that we should love the Lord
Our God with all the heart, with all the soul, and with all the mind, and our neighbor as
ourselves; for on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. Rightly, then,
Catholic Church, most true mother of Christians, dost thou not only teach that God alone,
to find whom is the happiest life, must be worshipped in perfect purity and chastity, bringing
in no creature as an object of adoration whom we should be required to serve; and from
that incorrupt and inviolable eternity to which alone man should be made subject, in
cleaving to which alone the rational soul escapes misery, excluding everything made,
everything liable to change, everything under the power of time; without confounding what
eternity, and truth, and peace itself keeps separate, or separating what a common majesty
unites: but thou dost also contain love and charity to our neighbor in such a way, that for
all kinds of diseases with which souls are for their sins afflicted, there is found with thee a
medicine of prevailing efficacy.</p>
<p>63. Thy training and teaching are childlike for children, forcible for youths, peaceful
for the aged, taking into account the age of the mind as well as of the body. Thou subjectest
women to their husbands in chaste and faithful obedience, not to gratify passion, but for
the propagation of offspring,135 and for domestic society. Thou givest to men authority
over their wives, not to mock the weaker sex, but in the laws of unfeigned love. Thou dost
subordinate children to their parents in a kind of free bondage, and dost set parents over
their children in a godly rule. Thou bindest brothers to brothers in a religious tie stronger
and closer than that of blood. Without violation of the connections of nature and of choice,
thou bringest within the bond of mutual love every relationship of kindred, and every alliance
of affinity. Thou teachest servants to cleave to their masters from delight in their task rather
than from the necessity of their position. Thou renderest masters forbearing to their servants,
from a regard to God their common Master, and more disposed to advise than to compel.
Thou unitest citizen to citizen, nation to nation, yea, man to man, from the recollection of
their first parents, not only in society but in fraternity. Thou teachest kings to seek the good
of their peoples; thou counsellest peoples to be subject to their kings. Thou teachest carefully

purification and sanctification of the man, it becomes plain how divine are these words, "I
am a consuming fire,"137 and, "I have come to send fire on the earth."138 These two utterances
of one God stamped on both Testaments, exhibit with harmonious testimony, the sanctific-
ation of the soul, pointing forward to the accomplishment of that which is also quoted in
the New Testament from the Old: "Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy
sting? Where, O death, is thy contest?"139 Could these heretics understand this one saying,
no longer proud but quite reconciled, they would worship God nowhere but with thee and
in thy bosom. In thee, as is fit, divine precepts are kept by widely-scattered multitudes. In
thee, as is fit, it is well understood how much more heinous sin is when the law is known

enough to consume all vices, can have its origin and growth in this life; but it does not follow that it can here
accomplish the purpose of its origin, so that no vice shall remain in the man; although this great effect is produced
by this same fervor of charity, when and where this is possible, that as the laver of regeneration purifies from
the guilt of all the sins which attach to man’s birth, or come from his evil conduct, so this perfection may purify
him from all stain from the vices which necessarily attend human infirmity in this world. So we must understand
the words of the apostle: ‘Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it; cleansing it with the washing of water
by the word, that He might present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing’ (Eph. v. 25-27). For in this world there is the washing of water by the word which purifies the Church.
But as the whole Church, as long as it is here, says, ‘Forgive us our debts,’ it certainly is not while here without

which adds to the force with which the consciousness of disregard of the precept strikes and

virtue. Thine, as is fit, are the many hospitable, the many friendly, the many compassionate,

<head>Chapter 31.—The Life of the Anachoretes and Coenobites Set Against the Continence
of the Manichæans.</head>
<p>65. What must we think is seen by those who can live without seeing their fellowcreatures,
though not without loving them? It must be something transcending human
things in contemplating which man can live without seeing his fellow-man. Hear now, ye
Manichæans, the customs and notable continence of perfect Christians, who have thought
it right not only to praise but also to practise the height of chastity, that you may be restrained,
if there is any shame in you, from vaunting your abstinence before uninstructed minds as
if it were the hardest of all things. I will speak of things of which you are not ignorant,
though you hide them from us. For who does not know that there is a daily increasing
multitude of Christian men of absolute continence spread all over the world, especially in
the East and in Egypt, as you cannot help knowing?</p>
<p>66. I will say nothing of those to whom I just now alluded, who, in complete seclusion
from the view of men, inhabit regions utterly barren, content with simple bread, which is
brought to them periodically, and with water, enjoying communion with God, to whom in
purity of mind they cleave, and most blessed in contemplating His beauty, which can be
seen only by the understanding of saints. I will say nothing of them, because some people
think them to have abandoned human things more than they ought, not considering how
much those may benefit us in their minds by prayer, and in their lives by example, whose
bodies we are not permitted to see. But to discuss this point would take long, and would
be fruitless; for if a man does not of his own accord regard this high pitch of sanctity as admirable
and honorable, how can our speaking lead him to do so? Only the Manichæans,
who make a boast of nothing, should be reminded that the abstinence and continence of
the great saints of the Catholic Church has gone so far, that some think it should be checked
and recalled within the limits of humanity,—so far above men, even in the judgment of
those who disapprove, have their minds soared.</p>
<p>67. But if this is beyond our tolerance, who can but admire and commend those who,
slighting and discarding the pleasures of this world, living together in a most chaste and
holy society, unite in passing their time in prayers, in readings, in discussions, without any
swelling of pride, or noise of contention, or sullenness of envy; but quiet, modest, peaceful,
their life is one of perfect harmony and devotion to God, an offering most acceptable to
Him from whom the power to do those things is obtained? No one possesses anything of
his own; no one is a burden to another. They work with their hands in such occupations
as may feed their bodies without distracting their minds from God. The product of their
toil they give to the decans or tithesmen,—so called from being set over the tithes,—so that
no one is occupied with the care of his body, either in food or clothes, or in anything else
required for daily use or for the common ailments. These decans, again, arranging everything
with great care, and meeting promptly the demands made by that life on account of bodily

<pb n="103"/>
infirmities, have one called "father," to whom they give in their accounts. These fathers are
not only more saintly in their conduct, but also distinguished for divine learning, and of
high character in every way; and without pride they superintend those whom they call their
children, having themselves great authority in giving orders, and meeting with willing
obedience from those under their charge. At the close of the day they assemble from their
separate dwellings before their meal to hear their father, assembling to the number of three
thousand at least for one father; for one may have even a much larger number than this.
They listen with astonishing eagerness in perfect silence, and give expression to the feelings
of their minds as moved by the words of the preacher, in groans, or tears, or signs of joy
without noise or shouting. Then there is refreshment for the body, as much as health and
a sound condition of the body requires, every one checking unlawful appetite, so as not to
go to excess even in the poor, inexpensive fare provided. So they not only abstain from flesh
and wine, in order to gain the mastery over their passions, but also from those things which
are only the more likely to whet the appetite of the palate and of the stomach, from what
some call their greater cleanness, which often serves as a ridiculous and disgraceful excuse
for an unseemly taste for exquisite viands, as distant from animal food. Whatever they
possess in addition to what is required for their support (and much is obtained, owing to
their industry and frugality), they distribute to the needy with greater care than they took
in procuring it for themselves. For while they make no effort to obtain abundance, they
make every effort to prevent their abundance remaining with them,—so much so, that they
send shiploads to places inhabited by poor people. I need say no more on a matter known
to all.141</p>
<p>68. Such, too, is the life of the women, who serve God assiduously and chastely, living
apart and removed as far as propriety demands from the men, to whom they are united only
in pious affection and in imitation of virtue. No young men are allowed access to them,
nor even old men, however respectable and approved, except to the porch, in order to furnish
necessary supplies. For the women occupy and maintain themselves by working in wool,
and hand over the cloth to the brethren, from whom, in return, they get what they need for
food. Such customs, such a life, such arrangements, such a system, I could not commend
as it deserves, if I wished to commend it; besides, I am afraid that it would seem as if I thought
it unlikely to gain acceptance from the mere description of it, if I considered myself obliged
to add an ornamental eulogium to the simple narrative. Ye Manichæans, find fault here if
you can. Do not bring into prominence our tares before men too blind to discriminate.</p>

many bishops have I known most excellent and holy men, how many presbyters, how many
deacons, and ministers of all kinds of the divine sacraments, whose virtue seems to me more
admirable and more worthy of commendation on account of the greater difficulty of preserving
it amidst the manifold varieties of men, and in this life of turmoil! For they preside
over men needing cure as much as over those already cured. The vices of the crowd must
be borne with in order that they may be cured, and the plague must be endured before it is
subdued. To keep here the best way of life and a mind calm and peaceful is very hard. Here,
in a word, we are among people who are learning to live. There they live.</p>

<pb n="105"/>
<head>Chapter 33.—Another Kind of Men Living Together in Cities. Fasts of Three Days.</head>
<p>70. Still I would not on this account cast a slight upon a praiseworthy class of Christians,—
those, namely, who live together in cities, quite apart from common life. I saw at
Milan a lodging-house of saints, in number not a few, presided over by one presbyter, a man
of great excellence and learning. At Rome I knew several places where there was in each
one eminent for weight of character, and prudence, and divine knowledge, presiding over
all the rest who lived with him, in Christian charity, and sanctity, and liberty. These, too,
are not burdensome to any one; but, in the Eastern fashion, and on the authority of the
Apostle Paul, they maintain themselves with their own hands. I was told that many practised
fasts of quite amazing severity, not merely taking only one meal daily towards night, which
is everywhere quite common, but very often continuing for three days or more in succession
without food or drink. And this among not men only, but women, who also live together
in great numbers as widows or virgins, gaining a livelihood by spinning and weaving, and
presided over in each case by a woman of the greatest judgment and experience, skilled and
accomplished not only in directing and forming moral conduct, but also in instructing the
understanding.142</p>
<p>71. With all this, no one is pressed to endure hardships for which he is unfit; nothing
is imposed on any one against his will; nor is he condemned by the rest because he confesses
himself too feeble to imitate them: for they bear in mind how strongly Scripture enjoins
charity on all: they bear in mind "To the pure all things are pure,"143 and "Not that which
entereth into your mouth defileth you, but that which cometh out of it."144 Accordingly,
all their endeavors are concerned not about the rejection of kinds of food as polluted, but
about the subjugation of inordinate desire and the maintenance of brotherly love. They
remember, "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and
them;"145 and again, "Neither if we eat shall we abound, nor if we refrain from eating shall
we be in want;"146 and, above all, this: "It is good, my brethren, not to eat flesh, nor drink
wine, nor anything whereby thy brother is offended;" for this passage shows that love is the
end to be aimed at in all these things. "For one man," he says, "believes that he can eat all
things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. He that eateth, let him not despise him that
eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath approved

him. Who art thou that thou shouldest judge another man’s servant? To his own master
he stands or fails; but he shall stand: for God is able to make him to stand." And a little
after: "He that eateth, to the Lord he eateth, and giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not,
to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks." And also in what follows: "So every one
of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not, then, any more judge one another:
but judge this rather, that ye place no stumbling-block, or cause of offence, in the way of a
brother. I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing common in itself:
but to him that thinketh anything to be common, to him it is common." Could he have
shown better that it is not in the things we eat, but in the mind, that there is a power able
to pollute it, and therefore that even those who are fit to think lightly of these things, and
know perfectly that they are not polluted if they take any food in mental superiority, without
being gluttons, should still have regard to charity? See what he adds: "For if thy brother be
grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably."147</p>
<p>72. Read the rest: it is too long to quote all. You will find that those able to think lightly
of such things,—that is, those of greater strength and stability,—are told that they must
nevertheless abstain, lest those should be offended who from their weakness are still in need
of such abstinence. The people I was describing know and observe these things; for they
are Christians, not heretics. They understand Scripture according to the apostolic teaching,
not according to the presumptuous and fictitious name of apostle.148 Him that eats not no
one despises; him that eats no one judges; he who is weak eats herbs. Many who are strong,
however, do this for the sake of the weak; with many the reason for so doing is not this, but
that they may have a cheaper diet, and may lead a life of the greatest tranquillity, with the
least expensive provision for the support of the body. "For all things are lawful for me," he
says; "but I will not be brought under the power of any." 149 Thus many do not eat flesh,
and yet do not superstitiously regard it as unclean. And so the same people who abstain
when in health take it when unwell without any fear, if it is required as a cure. Many drink
no wine; but they do not think that wine defiles them; for they cause it to be given with the
greatest propriety and moderation to people of languid temperament, and, in short, to all
who cannot have bodily health without it. When some foolishly refuse it, they counsel them
as brothers not to let a silly superstition make them weaker instead of making them holier.
They read to them the apostle’s precept to his disciple to "take a little wine for his many infirmities."
150 Then they diligently exercise piety; bodily exercise, they know, profiteth for
a short time, as the same apostle says.151</p>

<p>73. Those, then who are able, and they are without number, abstain both from flesh
and from wine for two reasons: either for the weakness of their brethren, or for their own
liberty. Charity is principally attended to. There is charity in their choice of diet, charity
in their speech, charity in their dress, charity in their looks. Charity is the point where they
meet, and the plan by which they act. To transgress against charity is thought criminal, like
transgressing against God. Whatever opposes this is attacked and expelled; whatever injures
it is not allowed to continue for a single day. They know that it has been so enjoined by
Christ and the apostles; that without it all things are empty, with it all are fulfilled.</p>

<p>74. Make objections against these, ye Manichæans, if you can. Look at these people,
and speak of them reproachfully, if you dare, without falsehood. Compare their fasts with
your fasts, their chastity with yours; compare them to yourselves in dress, food, self-restraint,
and, lastly, in charity. Compare, which is most to the point, their precepts with yours. Then
you will see the difference between show and sincerity, between the right way and the wrong,
between faith and imposture, between strength and inflatedness, between happiness and
wretchedness, between unity and disunion; in short, between the sirens of superstition and
the harbor of religion.</p>
<p>75. Do not summon against me professors of the Christian name, who neither know
nor give evidence of the power of their profession.152 Do not hunt up the numbers of ignorant
people, who even in the true religion are superstitious, or are so given up to evil passions
as to forget what they have promised to God. I know that there are many worshippers of
tombs and pictures. I know that there are many who drink to great excess over the dead,
and who, in the feasts which they make for corpses, bury themselves over the buried, and
give to their gluttony and drunkenness the name of religion. I know that there are many
who in words have renounced this world, and yet desire to be burdened with all the weight
of worldly things, and rejoice in such burdens. Nor is it surprising that among so many
multitudes you should find some by condemning whose life you may deceive the unwary
and seduce them from Catholic safety; for in your small numbers you are at a loss when
called on to show even one out of those whom you call the elect who keeps the precepts,
which in your indefensible superstition you profess. How silly those are, how impious, how
mischievous, and to what extent they are neglected by most, nearly all of you, I have shown

Catholic Church, by declaiming against the conduct of men whom the Church herself
condemns, seeking daily to correct them as wicked children. Then, if any of them by good
will and by the help of God are corrected, they regain by repentance what they had lost by
sin. Those, again, who with wicked will persist in their old vices, or even add to them others
still worse, are indeed allowed to remain in the field of the Lord, and to grow along with the

<p>77. Meanwhile, why do you rage? why does party spirit blind your eyes? Why do you
entangle yourselves in a long defence of such great error? Seek for fruit in the field, seek
for wheat in the floor: they will be found easily, and will present themselves to the inquirer.
Why do you look so exclusively at the dross? Why do you use the roughness of the hedge
to scare away the inexperienced from the fatness of the garden? There is a proper entrance,
though known to but a few; and by it men come in, though you disbelieve it, or do not wish
to find it. In the Catholic Church there are believers without number who do not use the
world, and there are those who "use it," in the words of the apostle, "as not using it,"155 as
was proved in those times when Christians were forced to worship idols. For then, how
many wealthy men, how many peasant householders, how many merchants, how many
military men, how many leading men in their own cities, and how many senators, people
of both sexes, giving up all these empty and transitory things, though while they used them
they were not bound down by them, endured death for the salutary faith and religion, and
proved to unbelievers that instead of being possessed by all these things they really possessed
them?</p>
<p>78. Why do you reproach us by saying that men renewed in baptism ought no longer
to beget children, or to possess fields, and houses, and money? Paul allows it. For, as cannot
be denied, he wrote to believers, after recounting many kinds of evil-doers who shall not
possess the kingdom of God: "And such were you," he says: "but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our
God." By the washed and sanctified, no one, assuredly, will venture to think any are meant
but believers, and those who have renounced this world. But, after showing to whom he
writes, let us see whether he allows these things to them. He goes on: "All things are lawful
for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought
under the power of any. Meat for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God will destroy
both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for
the body. But God raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by His own power. Know
ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ,
and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. Know ye not that he which is joined
to an harlot is made one body? for the twain, saith He, shall be one flesh. But he that is
joined to the Lord is one spirit. Flee fornication. Whatever sin a man doeth is without the
body: but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. Know ye not that

your body."156 "But of the things concerning which ye wrote to me: it is good for a man
not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife,
and let every woman have her own husband. Let the husband render unto the wife due
benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power of her
own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body,
but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may
have leisure for prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. For I would that all
men were even as I myself: but every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner,
and another after that."157</p>
<p>79. Has the apostle, think you, both shown sufficiently to the strong what is highest,
and permitted to the weaker what is next best? Not to touch a woman he shows is highest
when he says, "I would that all men were even as I myself." But next to this highest is conjugal
chastity, that man may not be the prey of fornication. Did he say that these people were
not yet believers because they were married? Indeed, by this conjugal chastity he says that
those who are united are sanctified by one another, if one of them is an unbeliever, and that
their children also are sanctified. "The unbelieving husband," he says, "is sanctified by the
believing wife, and the unbelieving woman by the believing husband: otherwise your children
would be unclean; but now are they holy."158 Why do you persist in opposition to such
plain truth? Why do you try to darken the light of Scripture by vain shadows?</p>
<p>80. Do not say that catechumens are allowed to have wives, but not believers; that catechumens
may have money, but not believers. For there are many who use as not using.
And in that sacred washing the renewal of the new man is begun so as gradually to reach
perfection, in some more quickly, in others more slowly. The progress, however, to a new
life is made in the case of many, if we view the matter without hostility, but attentively. As
the apostle says of himself, "Though the outward man perish, the inward man is renewed
day by day."159 The apostle says that the inward man is renewed day by day that it may
reach perfection; and you wish it to begin with perfection! And it were well if you did wish
it. In reality, you aim not at raising the weak, but at misleading the unwary. You ought not
to have spoken so arrogantly, even if it were known that you are perfect in your childish
precepts. But when your conscience knows that those whom you bring into your sect, when
they come to a more intimate acquaintance with you, will find many things in you which
nobody hearing you accuse others would suspect, is it not great impertinence to demand

<pb n="115"/>
<head>Chapter 1.—The Supreme Good is that Which is Possessed of Supreme Existence.</head>
<p>1. Every one, I suppose, will allow that the question of things good and evil belongs to
moral science, in which such terms are in common use. It is therefore to be wished that
men would bring to these inquiries such a clear intellectual perfection as might enable them
to see the chief good, than which nothing is better or higher, next in order to which comes
a rational soul in a state of purity and perfection. 160 If this were clearly understood, it
would also become evident that the chief good is that which is properly described as having
supreme and original existence. For that exists in the highest sense of the word which
continues always the same, which is throughout like itself, which cannot in any part be
corrupted or changed, which is not subject to time, which admits of no variation in its
present as compared with its former condition. This is existence in its true sense. For in
this signification of the word existence there is implied a nature which is self-contained,
and which continues immutably. Such things can be said only of God, to whom there is
nothing contrary in the strict sense of the word. For the contrary of existence is non-existence.
There is therefore no nature contrary to God. But since the minds with which we
approach the study of these subjects have their vision damaged and dulled by silly notions,
and by perversity of will, let us try as we can to gain some little knowledge of this great
matter by degrees and with caution, making our inquiries not like men able to see, but like
men groping the dark.</p>

Platonic.—A.H.N.]</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="116"/>
<head>Chapter 2.—What Evil is. That Evil is that Which is Against Nature. In Allowing
This, the Manichæans Refute Themselves.</head>
<p>2. You Manichæans often, if not in every case, ask those whom you try to bring over
to your heresy, Whence is evil? Suppose I had now met you for the first time, I would ask
you, if you please, to follow my example in putting aside for a little the explanation you
suppose yourselves to have got of these subjects, and to commence this great inquiry with
me as if for the first time. You ask me, Whence is evil? I ask you in return, What is evil?
Which is the more reasonable question? Are those right who ask whence a thing is, when
they do not know what it is; or he who thinks it necessary to inquire first what it is, in order
to avoid the gross absurdity of searching for the origin of a thing unknown? Your answer
is quite correct, when you say that evil is that which is contrary to nature; for no one is so
mentally blind as not to see that, in every kind, evil is that which is contrary to the nature
of the kind. But the establishment of this doctrine is the overthrow of your heresy. For evil
is no nature, if it is contrary to nature. Now, according to you, evil is a certain nature and
substance. Moreover, whatever is contrary to nature must oppose nature and seek its destruction.
For nature means nothing else than that which anything is conceived of as being
in its own kind. Hence is the new word which we now use derived from the word for being,—
essence namely, or, as we usually say, substance,—while before these words were in
use, the word nature was used instead. Here, then, if you will consider the matter without
stubbornness, we see that evil is that which falls away from essence and tends to non-existence.</p>
<p>3. Accordingly, when the Catholic Church declares that God is the author of all natures
and substances, those who understand this understand at the same time that God is not the
author of evil. For how can He who is the cause of the being of all things be at the same
time the cause of their not being,—that is, of their falling off from essence and tending to
non-existence? For this is what reason plainly declares to be the definition of evil. Now,
how can that race of evil of yours, which you make the supreme evil, be against nature, that
is, against substance, when it, according to you, is itself a nature and substance? For if it
acts against itself, it destroys its own existence; and when that is completely done, it will
come at last to be the supreme evil. But this cannot be done, because you will have it not
only to be, but to be everlasting. That cannot then be the chief evil which is spoken of as a
substance. 161</p>
<p>4. But what am I to do? I know that many of you can understand nothing of all this.
I know, too, that there are some who have a good understanding and can see these things,
<note type="footnote">161 [On Augustin’s view of negativity of evil and on the relation of this view to Neo-Platonism, see Introduction,
chapter IX. Augustin’s view seems to exclude the permanence of evil in the world, and so everlasting
punishment and everlasting rebellion against God.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="117"/>
and yet are so stubborn in their choice of evil,—a choice that will ruin their understanding
as well,—that they try rather to find what reply they can make in order to impose upon inactive
and feeble minds, instead of giving their assent to the truth. Still I shall not regret
having written either what one of you may come some day to consider impartially, and be
led to abandon your error, or what men of understanding and in allegiance to God, and
who are still untainted with your errors, may read and so be kept from being led astray by
your addresses.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—If Evil is Defined as that Which is Hurtful, This Implies Another Refutation
of the Manichæans.</head>
<p>5. Let us then inquire more carefully, and, if possible, more plainly. I ask you again,
What is evil? If you say it is that which is hurtful, here, too, you will not answer amiss. But
consider, I pray you; be on your guard, I beg of you; be so good as to lay aside party spirit,
and make the inquiry for the sake of finding the truth, not of getting the better of it. Whatever
is hurtful takes away some good from that to which it is hurtful; for without the loss of good
there can be no hurt. What, I appeal to you, can be plainer than this? what more intelligible?
What else is required for complete demonstration to one of average understanding, if he is
not perverse? But, if this is granted, the consequence seems plain. In that race which you
take for the chief evil, nothing can be liable to be hurt, since there is no good in it. But if,
as you assert, there are two natures,—the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness;
since you make the kingdom of light to be God, attributing to it an uncompounded nature,162
so that it has no part inferior to another, you must grant, however decidedly in opposition
to yourselves, you must grant, nevertheless, that this nature, which you not only do not deny
to be the chief good, but spend all your strength in trying to show that it is so, is immutable,
incorruptible, impenetrable, inviolable, for otherwise it would not be the chief good; for the
chief good is that than which there is nothing better, and for such a nature to be hurt is
impossible. Again, if, as has been shown, to hurt is to deprive of good, there can be no hurt
to the kingdom of darkness, for there is no good in it. And as the kingdom of light cannot
be hurt, as it is inviolable, what can the evil you speak of be hurtful to?</p>
<note type="footnote">162 [It is probable that Mani thought of the Kingdom of Light pantheistically, and that the principles personified
in his mythological system were the result of efforts on his part to connect the infinite with the finite.—

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="119"/>
<head>Chapter 4.—The Difference Between What is Good in Itself and What is Good by
Participation.</head>
<p>6. Now, compare with this perplexity, from which you cannot escape, the consistency
of the statements in the teaching of the Catholic Church, according to which there is one
good which is good supremely and in itself, and not by the participation of any good, but
by its own nature and essence; and another good which is good by participation, and by
having something bestowed. Thus it has its being as good from the supreme good, which,
however, is still self-contained, and loses nothing. This second kind of good is called a
creature, which is liable to hurt through falling away. But of this falling away God is not
the author, for He is author of existence and of being. Here we see the proper use of the
word evil; for it is correctly applied not to essence, but to negation or loss. We see, too, what
nature it is which is liable to hurt. This nature is not the chief evil, for when it is hurt it loses
good; nor is it the chief good, for its falling away from good is because it is good not intrinsically,
but by possessing the good. And a thing cannot be good by nature when it is spoken
of as being made, which shows that the goodness was bestowed. Thus, on the one hand,
God is the good, and all things which He has made are good, though not so good as He who
made them. For what madman would venture to require that the works should equal the
workman, the creatures the Creator? What more do you want? Could you wish for anything
plainer than this?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="120"/>
<head>Chapter 5.—If Evil is Defined to Be Corruption, This Completely Refutes the
Manichæan Heresy.</head>
<p>7. I ask a third time, What is evil? Perhaps you will reply, Corruption. Undeniably this
is a general definition of evil; for corruption implies opposition to nature, and also hurt.
But corruption exists not by itself, but in some substance which it corrupts; for corruption
itself is not a substance. So the thing which it corrupts is not corruption, is not evil; for what
is corrupted suffers the loss of integrity and purity. So that which has no purity to lose
cannot be corrupted; and what has, is necessarily good by the participation of purity. Again,
what is corrupted is perverted; and what is perverted suffers the loss of order, and order is
good. To be corrupted, then, does not imply the absence of good; for in corruption it can
be deprived of good, which could not be if there was the absence of good. Therefore that
race of darkness, if it was destitute of all good, as you say it was, could not be corrupted, for
it had nothing which corruption could take from it; and if corruption takes nothing away,
it does not corrupt. Say now, if you dare, that God and the kingdom of God can be corrupted,
when you cannot show how the kingdom of the devil, such as you make it, can be corrupted.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="121"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—What Corruption Affects and What It is.</head>
<p>8. What further does the Catholic light say? What do you suppose, but what is the actual
truth, that it is the created substance which can be corrupted, for the uncreated, which
is the chief good, is incorruptible; and corruption, which is the chief evil, cannot be corrupted;
besides, that it is not a substance? But if you ask what corruption is, consider to what it
seeks to bring the things which it corrupts; for it affects those things according to its own
nature. Now all things by corruption fall away from what they were, and are brought to
non-continuance, to non-existence; for existence implies continuance. Thus the supreme
and chief existence is so called because it continues in itself, or is self-contained. In the case
of a thing changing for the better, the change is not from continuance, but from perversion
to the worse, that is, from falling away from essence; the author of which falling away is not
He who is the author of the essence. So in some things there is change for the better, and
so a tendency towards existence. And this change is not called a perversion, but reversion
or conversion; for perversion is opposed to orderly arrangement. Now things which tend
towards existence tend towards order, and, attaining order they attain existence, as far as
that is possible to a creature. For order reduces to a certain uniformity that which it arranges;
and existence is nothing else than being one. Thus, so far as anything acquires unity, so far
it exists. For uniformity and harmony are the effects of unity, and by these compound things
exist as far as they have existence. For simple things exist by themselves, for they are one.
But things not simple imitate unity by the agreement of their parts; and so far as they attain
this, so far they exist. This arrangement is the cause of existence, disorder of non-existence;
and perversion or corruption are the other names for disorder. So whatever is corrupted
tends to non-existence. You may now be left to reflect upon the effect of corruption, that
you may discover what is the chief evil; for it is that which corruption aims at accomplishing.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="122"/>
<head>Chapter 7.—The Goodness of God Prevents Corruption from Bringing Anything
to Non-Existence. The Difference Between Creating and Forming.</head>
<p>9. But the goodness of God does not permit the accomplishment of this end, but so
orders all things that fall away that they may exist where their existence is most suitable, till
in the order of their movements they return to that from which they fell away.163 Thus,
when rational souls fall away from God, although they possess the greatest amount of freewill,
He ranks them in the lower grades of creation, where their proper place is. So they
suffer misery by the divine judgment, while they are ranked suitably to their deserts. Hence
we see the excellence of that saying which you are always inveighing against so strongly, "I
make good things, and create evil things."164 To create is to form and arrange. So in some
copies it is written, "I make good things and form evil things." To make is used of things
previously not in existence; but to form is to arrange what had some kind of existence, so
as to improve and enlarge it. Such are the things which God arranges when He says, "I form
evil things," meaning things which are falling off, and so tending to non-existence,—not
things which have reached that to which they tend. For it has been said, Nothing is allowed
in the providence of God to go the length of non-existence.165</p>
<p>10. These things might be discussed more fully and at greater length, but enough has
been said for our purpose in dealing with you. We have only to show you the gate which
you despair of finding, and make the uninstructed despair of it too. You can be made to
enter only by good-will, on which the divine mercy bestows peace, as the song in the Gospel
says, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good-will."166 It is enough,
I say, to have shown you that there is no way of solving the religious question of good and
evil, unless whatever is, as far as it is, is from God; while as far as it falls away from being it
is not of God, and yet is always ordered by Divine Providence in agreement with the whole
system. If you do not yet see this, I know nothing else that I can do but to discuss the things
already said with greater particularity. For nothing save piety and purity can lead the mind
to greater things.</p>
<note type="footnote">163 In Retract. i. 7, § 6, it is said: "This must not be understood to mean that all things return to that from
which they fell away, as Origen believed, but only those which do return. Those who shall be punished in
everlasting fire do not return to God, from whom they fell away. Still they are in order as existing in punishment
where their existence is most suitable." [This does not really meet the difficulty suggested on a preceding

<pb n="123"/>
<head>Chapter 8.—Evil is Not a Substance, But a Disagreement Hostile to Substance.</head>
<p>11. For what other answer will you give to the question, What is evil? but either that it
is against nature, or that it is hurtful, or that it is corruption, or something similar? But I
have shown that in these replies you make shipwreck of your cause, unless, indeed, you will
answer in the childish way in which you generally speak to children, that evil is fire, poison,
a wild beast, and so on. For one of the leaders of this heresy, whose instructions we attended
with great familiarity and frequency, used to say with reference to a person who held that
evil was not a substance, "I should like to put a scorpion in the man’s hand, and see whether
he would not withdraw his hand; and in so doing he would get a proof, not in words but in
the thing itself, that evil is a substance, for he would not deny that the animal is a substance."
He said this not in the presence of the person, but to us, when we repeated to him the remark
which had troubled us, giving, as I said, a childish answer to children. For who with the
least tincture of learning or science does not see that these things hurt by disagreement with
the bodily temperament, while at other times they agree with it, so as not only not to hurt,
but to produce the best effects? For if this poison were evil in itself, the scorpion itself would
suffer first and most. In fact, if the poison were quite taken from the animal, it would die.
So for its body it is evil to lose what it is evil for our body to receive; and it is good for it to
have what it is good for us to want. Is the same thing then both good and evil? By no means;
but evil is what is against nature, for this is evil both to the animal and to us. This evil is the
disagreement, which certainly is not a substance, but hostile to substance. Whence then is
it? See what it leads to, and you will learn, if any inner light lives in you. It leads all that it
destroys to non-existence. Now God is the author of existence; and there is no existence
which, as far as it is existing, leads to non-existence: Thus we learn whence disagreement
is not; as to whence it is, nothing can be said.</p>
<p>12. We read in history of a female criminal in Athens, who succeeded in drinking the
quantity of poison allotted as a fatal draught for the condemned with little or no injury to
her health, by taking it at intervals. So being condemned, she took the poison in the prescribed
quantity like the rest, but rendered it powerless by accustoming herself to it, and
did not die like the rest. And as this excited great wonder, she was banished. If poison is
an evil, are we to think that she made it to be no evil to her? What could be more absurd
than this? But because disagreement is an evil, what she did was to make the poisonous
matter agree with her own body by a process of habituation. For how could she by any
amount of cunning have brought it about that disagreement should not hurt her? Why so?
Because what is truly and properly an evil is hurtful both always and to all. Oil is beneficial
to our bodies, but very much the opposite to many six-footed animals. And is not hellebore
sometimes food, sometimes medicine, and sometimes poison. Does not every one maintain
that salt taken in excess is poisonous? And yet the benefits to the body from salt are innumerable
and most important. Sea-water is injurious when drunk by land animals, but it is

<pb n="124"/>
most suitable and useful to many who bathe their bodies in it and to fish it is useful and
wholesome in both ways. Bread nourishes man, but kills hawks. And does not mud itself,
which is offensive and noxious when swallowed or smelt, serve as cooling to the touch in
hot weather, and as a cure for wounds from fire? What can be nastier than dung, or more
worthless than ashes? And yet they are of such use to the fields, that the Romans thought
divine honors due to the discoverer, Stercutio, from whose name the word for dung [stercus]
is derived.</p>
<p>13. But why enumerate details which are countless? We need not go farther than the
four elements themselves, which, as every one knows, are beneficial when there is agreement,
and bitterly opposed to nature when there is disagreement in the objects acted upon. We
who live in air die under earth or under water, while innumerable animals creep alive in
sand or loose earth, and fish die in our air. Fire consumes our bodies, but, when suitably
applied, it both restores from cold, and expels diseases without number. The sun to which
you bow the knee, and than which, indeed, there is no fairer object among visible things,
strengthens the eyes of eagles, but hurts and dims our eyes when we gaze on it; and yet we
too can accustom ourselves to look upon it without injury. Will you, then, allow the sun to
be compared to the poison which the Athenian woman made harmless by habituating herself
to it? Reflect for once, and consider that if a substance is an evil because it hurts some one,
the light which you worship cannot be acquitted of this charge. See the preferableness of
making evil in general to consist in this disagreement, from which the sun’s ray produces
dimness in the eyes, though nothing is pleasanter to the eyes than light.167</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="125"/>
<head>Chapter 9.—The Manichæan Fictions About Things Good and Evil are Not Consistent
with Themselves.</head>
<p>14. I have said these things to make you cease, if that is possible, giving the name of
evil to a region boundless in depth and length; to a mind wandering through the region; to
the five caverns of the elements,—one full of darkness, another of waters, another of winds,
another of fire, another of smoke; to the animals born in each of these elements,—serpents
in the darkness, swimming creatures in the waters, flying creatures in the winds, quadrupeds
in the fire, bipeds in the smoke. For these things, as you describe them, cannot be called
evil; for all such things, as far as they exist, must have their existence from the most high
God, for as far as they exist they are good. If pain and weakness is an evil, the animals you
speak of were of such physical strength that their abortive offspring, after, as your sect believes,
the world was formed of them, fell from heaven to earth, according to you, and could
not die. If blindness is an evil, they could see; if deafness, they could hear. If to be nearly
or altogether dumb is an evil, their speech was so clear and intelligible, that, as you assert,
they decided to make war against God in compliance with an address delivered in their assembly.
If sterility is an evil, they were prolific in children. If exile is an evil, they were in
their own country, and occupied their own territories. If servitude is an evil, some of them
were rulers. If death is an evil, they were alive, and the life was such that, by your statement,
even after God was victorious, it was impossible for the mind ever to die.</p>
<p>15. Can you tell me how it is that in the chief evil so many good things are to be found,
the opposites of the evils above mentioned? and if these are not evils, can any substance be
an evil, as far as it is a substance? If weakness is not an evil, can a weak body be an evil? If
blindness is not an evil, can darkness be an evil? If deafness is not an evil, can a deaf man
be an evil? If dumbness is not an evil, can a fish be an evil? If sterility is not an evil, how
can we call a barren animal an evil? If exile is not an evil, how can we give that name to an
animal in exile, or to an animal sending some one into exile? If servitude is not an evil, in
what sense is a subject animal an evil, or one enforcing subjection? If death is not an evil,
in what sense is a mortal animal an evil, or one causing death? Or if these are evils, must
we not give the name of good things to bodily strength, sight, hearing, persuasive speech,
fertility, native land, liberty, life, all which you hold to exist in that kingdom of evil, and yet
venture to call it the perfection of evil?</p>
<p>16. Once more, if, as has never been denied, unsuitableness is an evil, what can be more
suitable than those elements to their respective animals,—the darkness to serpents, the waters
to swimming creatures, the winds to flying creatures, the fire to voracious animals, the
smoke to soaring animals? Such is the harmony which you describe as existing in the race
of strife; such the order in the seat of confusion. If what is hurtful is an evil, I do not repeat
the strong objection already stated, that no hurt can be suffered where no good exists; but
if that is not so clear, one thing at least is easily seen and understood as following from the

<pb n="126"/>
acknowledged truth, that what is hurtful is an evil. The smoke in that region did not hurt
bipeds: it produced them, and nourished and sustained them without injury in their birth,
their growth, and their rule. But now, when the evil has some good mixed with it, the smoke
has become more hurtful, so that we, who certainly are bipeds, instead of being sustained
by it, are blinded, and suffocated, and killed by it. Could the mixture of good have given
such destructiveness to evil elements? Could there be such confusion in the divine government?</p>
<p>17. In the other cases, at least, how is it that we find that congruity which misled your
author and induced him to fabricate falsehoods? Why does darkness agree with serpents,
and waters with swimming creatures, and winds with flying creatures, though the fire burns
up quadrupeds, and smoke chokes us? Then, again, have not serpents very sharp sight, and
do they not love the sunshine, and abound most where the calmness of the air prevents the
clouds from gathering much or often? How very absurd that the natives and lovers of
darkness should live most comfortably and agreeably where the clearest light is enjoyed!
Or if you say that it is the heat rather than the light that they enjoy, it would be more reasonable
to assign to fire serpents, which are naturally of rapid motion, than the slow-going
asp.168 Besides, all must admit that light is agreeable to the eyes of the asp, for they are
compared to an eagle’s eyes. But enough of the lower animals. Let us, I pray, attend to what
is true of ourselves without persisting in error, and so our minds shall be disentangled from
silly and mischievous falsehoods. For is it not intolerable perversity to say that in the race
of darkness, where there was no mixture of light, the biped animals had so sound and strong,
so incredible force of eyesight, that even in their darkness they could see the perfectly pure
light (as you represent it) of the kingdom of God? for, according to you, even these beings
could see this light, and could gaze at it, and study it, and delight in it, and desire it; whereas
our eyes, after mixture with light, with the chief good, yea, with God, have become so tender
and weak, that we can neither see anything in the dark, nor bear to look at the sun, but, after
looking, lose sight of what we could see before.</p>
<p>18. The same remarks are applicable if we take corruption to be an evil, which no one
doubts. The smoke did not corrupt that race of animals, though it corrupts animals now.
Not to go over all the particulars, which would be tedious, and is not necessary, the living
creatures of your imaginary description were so much less liable to corruption than animals
are now, that their abortive and premature offspring, cast headlong from heaven to earth,
both lived and were productive, and could band together again, having, forsooth, their original
vigor, because they were conceived before good was mixed with the evil; for, after this
mixture, the animals born are, according to you, those which we now see to be very feeble
and easily giving way to corruption. Can any one persist in the belief of error like this, unless

<head>Chapter 10.—Three Moral Symbols Devised by the Manichæans for No Good.</head>
<p>19. Now that I have shown, as I think, how much darkness and error is in your opinions
about good and evil things in general, let us examine now those three symbols which you
extol so highly, and boast of as excellent observances. What then are those three symbols?
That of the mouth, that of the hands, and that of the breast. What does this mean? That
man, we are told, should be pure and innocent in mouth, in hands, and in breast. But what
if he sins with eyes, ears, or nose? What if he hurts some one with his heels, or perhaps kills
him? How can he be reckoned criminal when he has not sinned with mouth, hands, or
breast? But, it is replied, by the mouth we are to understand all the organs of sense in the
head; by the hands, all bodily actions; by the breast, all lustful tendencies. To what, then,
do you assign blasphemies? To the mouth or to the hand? For blasphemy is an action of
the tongue. And if all actions are to be classed under one head, why should you join together
the actions of the hands and the feet, and not those of the tongue. Do you wish to separate
the action of the tongue, as being for the purpose of expressing something, from actions
which are not for this purpose, so that the symbol of the hands should mean abstinence
from all evil actions which are not for the purpose of expressing something? But then, what
if some one sins by expressing something with his hands, as is done in writing or in some
significant gesture? This cannot be assigned to the tongue and the mouth, for it is done by
the hands. When you have three symbols of the mouth, the hands, and the breast, it is quite
inadmissible to charge against the mouth sins found in the hands. And if you assign action
in general to the hands, there is no reason for including under this the action of the feet and
not that of the tongue. Do you see how the desire of novelty, with its attendant error, lands
you in great difficulties? For you find it impossible to include purification of all sins in these
three symbols, which you set forth as a kind of new classification.</p>

<pb n="129"/>
<head>Chapter 11.—The Value of the Symbol of the Mouth Among the Manichæans, Who
are Found Guilty of Blaspheming God.</head>
<p>20. Classify as you please, omit what you please, we must discuss the doctrines you insist
upon most. You say that the symbol of the mouth implies refraining from all blasphemy.
But blasphemy is speaking evil of good things. So usually the word blasphemy is applied
only to speaking evil of God; for as regards man there is uncertainty, but God is without
controversy good. If, then, you are proved guilty of saying worse things of God than any
one else says, what becomes of your famous symbol of the mouth? The evidence is not obscure,
but clear and obvious to every understanding, and irresistible, the more so that no
one can remain in ignorance of it, that God is incorruptible, immutable, liable to no injury,
to no want, to no weakness, to no misery. All this the common sense of rational beings
perceives, and even you assent when you hear it.</p>
<p>21. But when you begin to relate your fables, that God is corruptible, and mutable, and
subject to injury, and exposed to want and weakness, and not secure from misery, this is
what you are blind enough to teach, and what some are blind enough to believe. And this
is not all; for, according to you, God is not only corruptible, but corrupted; not only
changeable, but changed; not only subject to injury, but injured; not only liable to want, but
in want; not only possibly, but actually weak; not only exposed to misery, but miserable.
You say that the soul is God, or a part of God. I do not see how it can be part of God without
being God. A part of gold is gold; of silver silver; of stone stone; and, to come to greater
things, part of earth is earth, part of water is water, and of air air; and if you take part from
fire, you will not deny it to be fire; and part of light can be nothing but light. Why then
should part of God not be God? Has God a jointed body, like man and the lower animals?
For part of man is not man.</p>
<p>22. I will deal with each of these opinions separately. If you view God as resembling
light, you must admit that part of God is God. Hence, when you make the soul part of God,
though you allow it to be corrupted as being foolish, and changed as having once been wise,
and in want as needing health, and feeble as needing medicine, and miserable as desiring
happiness, all these things you profanely attribute to God. Or if you deny these things of
the mind, it follows that the Spirit is not required to lead the soul into truth, since it is not
in folly; nor is the soul renewed by true religion, since it does not need renewal; nor is it
perfected by your symbols, since it is already perfect; nor does God give it assistance, since
it does not need it; nor is Christ its physician, since it is in health; nor does it require the
promise of happiness in another life. Why then is Jesus called the deliverer, according to
His own words in the Gospel, "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed?"169
<note type="footnote">169 John viii. 36.</note>

<pb n="130"/>
And the Apostle Paul says, "Ye have been called to liberty."170 The soul, then, which has
not attained this liberty is in bondage. Therefore, according to you, God, since part of God
is God, is both corrupted by folly, and is changed by falling, and is injured by the loss of
perfection, and is in need of help, and is weakened by disease, and bowed down with misery,
and subject to disgraceful bondage.</p>
<p>23. Again, if part of God is not God, still He is not incorrupt when His part is corrupted,
nor unchanged when there is change in any part, nor uninjured when He is not perfect in
every part, nor free from want when He is busily endeavoring to recover part of Himself,
nor quite whole when He has a weak part, nor perfectly happy when any part is suffering
misery, nor entirely free when any part is under bondage. These are conclusions to which
you are driven, because you say that the soul, which you see to be in such a calamitous
condition, is part of God. If you can succeed in making your sect abandon these and many
similar opinions, then you may speak of your mouth being free from blasphemies. Better
still, leave the sect; for if you cease to believe and to repeat what Manichæus has written,
you will be no longer Manichæans.</p>
<p>24. That God is the supreme good, and that than which nothing can be or can be conceived
better, we must either understand or believe, if we wish to keep clear of blasphemy.
There is a relation of numbers which cannot possibly be impaired or altered, nor can any
nature by any amount of violence prevent the number which comes after one from being
the double of one. This can in no way be changed; and yet you represent God as changeable!
This relation preserves its integrity inviolable; and you will not allow God an equality even
in this! Let some race of darkness take in the abstract the number three, consisting of indivisible
units, and divide it into two equal parts. Your mind perceives that no hostility could
effect this. And can that which is unable to injure a numerical relation injure God? If it
could not, what possible necessity could there be for a part of him to be mixed with evil,
and driven into such miseries?</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—Manichæan Subterfuge.</head>
<p>25. For this gives rise to the question, which used to throw us into great perplexity even
when we were your zealous disciples, nor could we find any answer,—what the race of
darkness would have done to God, supposing He had refused to fight with it at the cost of
such calamity to part of Himself. For if God would not have suffered any loss by remaining
quiet, we thought it hard that we had been sent to endure so much. Again, if He would have
suffered, His nature cannot have been incorruptible, as it behoves the nature of God to be.
Sometimes the answer was, that it was not for the sake of escaping evil or avoiding injury,
but that God in His natural goodness wished to bestow the blessing of order on a disturbed
and disordered nature. This is not what we find in the Manichæan books: there it is constantly
implied and constantly asserted that God guarded against an invasion of His enemies.
But supposing this answer, which was given from want of a better, to represent the opinion
of the Manichæans, is God, in their view, vindicated from the charge of cruelty or weakness?
For this goodness of His to the hostile race proved most pernicious to His own subjects.
Besides, if God’s nature could not be corrupted nor changed, neither could any destructive
influence corrupt or change us; and the order to be bestowed on the race of strangers might
have been bestowed without robbing us of it.</p>
<p>26. Since those times, however, another answer has appeared which I heard recently at
Carthage. For one, whom I wish much to see brought out of this error, when reduced to
this same dilemma, ventured to say that the kingdom had its own limits, which might be
invaded by a hostile race, though God Himself could not be injured. But this is a reply which
your founder would never consent to give; for he would be likely to see that such an opinion
would lead to a still speedier demolition of his heresy. And in fact any one of average intellect,
who hears that in this nature part is subject to injury and part not, will at once perceive that
this makes not two but three natures,—one violable, a second inviolable, and a third violating.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Actions to Be Judged of from Their Motive, Not from Externals.
Manichæan Abstinence to Be Tried by This Principle.</head>
<p>27. Having every day in your mouth these blasphemies which come from your heart,
you ought not to continue holding up the symbol of the mouth as something wonderful, to
ensnare the ignorant. But perhaps you think the symbol of the mouth excellent and admirable
because you do not eat flesh or drink wine. But what is your end in this? For according as
the end we have in view in our actions, on account of which we do whatever we do, is not
only not culpable but also praiseworthy, so only can our actions merit any praise. If the end
we have regard to in any performance is unlawful and blameworthy, the performance itself
will be unhesitatingly condemned as improper.</p>
<p>28. We are told of Catiline that he could bear cold, thirst, and hunger.171 This the vile
miscreant had in common with our apostles. What then distinguishes the parricide from
our apostles but the precisely opposite end which he followed? He bore these things in order
to gratify his fierce and ungoverned passions; they, on the other hand, in order to restrain
these passions and subdue them to reason. You often say, when you are told of the great
number of Catholic virgins, a she-mule is a virgin. This, indeed, is said in ignorance of the
Catholic system, and is not applicable. Still, what you mean is that this continence is
worthless unless it leads, on right principles, to an end of high excellence. Catholic Christians
might also compare your abstinence from wine and flesh to that of cattle and many small
birds, as likewise of countless sorts of worms. But, not to be impertinent like you, I will not
make this comparison prematurely, but will first examine your end in what you do. For I
suppose I may safely take it as agreed on, that in such customs the end is the thing to look
to. Therefore, if your end is to be frugal and to restrain the appetite which finds gratification
in eating and drinking, I assent and approve. But this is not the case.</p>
<p>29. Suppose, what is quite possible, that there is one so frugal and sparing in his diet,
that, instead of gratifying his appetite or his palate, he refrains from eating twice in one day,
and at supper takes a little cabbage moistened and seasoned with lard, just enough to keep
down hunger; and quenches his thirst, from regard to his health, with two or three draughts
of pure wine; and this is his regular diet: whereas another of different habits never takes
flesh or wine, but makes an agreeable repast at two o’clock on rare and foreign vegetables,
varied with a number of courses, and well sprinkled with pepper, and sups in the same style
towards night; and drinks honey-vinegar, mead, raisin-wine, and the juices of various fruits,
no bad imitation of wine, and even surpassing it in sweetness; and drinks not for thirst but
for pleasure; and makes this provision for himself daily, and feasts in this sumptuous style,
not because he requires it, but only gratifying his taste;—which of these two do you regard
<note type="footnote">171 Sallust, in prolog. Catilin. § 3.</note>

<pb n="133"/>
as living most abstemiously in food and drink? You cannot surely be so blind as not to put
the man of the little lard and wine above this glutton!</p>
<p>30. This is the true view; but your doctrine sounds very differently. For one of your
elect distinguished by the three symbols may live like the second person in this description,
and though he may be reproved by one or two of the more sedate, he cannot be condemned
as abusing the symbols. But should he sup with the other person, and moisten his lips with
a morsel of rancid bacon, or refresh them with a drink of spoilt wine, he is pronounced a
transgressor of the symbol, and by the judgment of your founder is consigned to hell, while
you, though wondering, must assent. Will you not discard these errors? Will you not listen
to reason? Will you not offer some little resistance to the force of habit? Is not such doctrine
most unreasonable? Is it not insanity? Is it not the greatest absurdity that one, who stuffs
and loads his stomach every day to gratify his appetite with mushrooms, rice, truffles, cake,
mead, pepper, and assafoetida, and who fares thus every day, cannot be convicted of transgressing
the three symbols, that is, the rule of sanctity; whereas another, who seasons his
dish of the commonest herbs with some smoky morsel of meat, and takes only so much of
this as is needed for the refreshment of his body, and drinks three cups of wine for the sake
of keeping in health, should, for exchanging the former diet for this, be doomed to certain
punishment?</p>

<head>Chapter 14.—Three Good Reasons for Abstaining from Certain Kinds of Food.</head>
<p>31. But, you reply, the apostle says, "It is good, brethren, neither to eat flesh, nor to
drink wine."172 No one denies that this is good, provided that it is for the end already
mentioned, of which it is said, "Make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof;"173
or for the ends pointed out by the apostle, namely, either to check the appetite, which is apt
to go to a more wild and uncontrollable excess in these things than in others, or lest a
brother should be offended, or lest the weak should hold fellowship with an idol. For at the
time when the apostle wrote, the flesh of sacrifices was often sold in the market. And because
wine, too, was used in libations to the gods of the Gentiles, many weaker brethren, accustomed
to purchase such things, preferred to abstain entirely from flesh and wine rather than
run the risk of having fellowship, as they considered it, with idols, even ignorantly. And,
for their sakes, even those who were stronger, and had faith enough to see the insignificance
of these things, knowing that nothing is unclean except from an evil conscience, and holding
by the saying of the Lord, "Not that which entereth into your mouth defileth you, but that
which cometh out of it," 174 still, lest these weaker brethren should stumble, were bound to
abstain from these things. And this is not a mere theory, but is clearly taught in the epistles
of the apostle himself. For you are in the habit of quoting only the words, "It is good,
brethren, neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine," without adding what follows, "nor anything
whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended or is made weak." These words show the
intention of the apostle in giving the admonition.</p>
<p>32. This is evident from the preceding and succeeding context. The passage is a long
one to quote, but, for the sake of those who are indolent in reading and searching the sacred
Scriptures, we must give the whole of it. "Him that is weak in the faith," says the apostle,
"receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. For one believeth that he may eat all things:
another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and
let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth, for God hath received him. Who art thou
that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth; yea, he shall
be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. One man esteemeth one day above another;
another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for
he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God
thanks. For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. For whether we live,
we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live, therefore,
or die, we are the Lord’s. For to this end Christ both lived, and died and rose again, that He
<note type="footnote">172 Rom. xiv. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">173 Rom. xiii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">174 Matt. xv. 2.</note>

<pb n="135"/>
might be Lord both of the dead and living. But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why
dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.
For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall
confess to God.175 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not,
therefore, judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock,
or occasion to fall, in his brother’s way. I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus,
that there is nothing common of itself: but to him that esteemeth anything to be common,
to him it is common. But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not
charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. Let not then our good
be evil spoken of. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. For he who in this serveth Christ is acceptable to God,
and approved of men. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and
things whereby one may edify another. For meat destroys not the work of God. All things
indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offense. It is good neither to eat
flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is
made weak. Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he who condemneth
not himself in that thing which he alloweth. And he that distinguishes is damned if he eats,
because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. We then that are strong
ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us
please his neighbor for his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not Himself."176</p>
<p>33. Is it not clear that what the apostle required was, that the stronger should not eat
flesh nor drink wine, because they gave offense to the weak by not going along with them,
and made them think that those who in faith judged all things to be pure, did homage to
idols in not abstaining from that kind of food and drink? This is also set forth in the following
passage of the Epistle to the Corinthians: "As concerning, therefore, the eating of those
things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world,
and that there is none other God but one. For though there be that are called gods, whether
in heaven or in earth, but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and
we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him. Howbeit
there is not in every man that knowledge: for some, with conscience of the idol unto this
hour, eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. But
meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, shall we abound; neither, if we eat
not, shall we suffer want. But take heed, lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
stumbling-block to them that are weak. For if any man see one who has knowledge sit at
meat in the idol’s temple, shall not his conscience being weak be emboldened to eat those
<note type="footnote">175 Isa. xlv. 23, 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">176 Rom. xiv. and xv. 1-3.</note>

<pb n="136"/>
things which are offered to idols; and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish,
for whom Christ died? But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
conscience, ye sin against Christ. Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat
no flesh forever, lest I make my brother to offend."177</p>
<p>34. Again, in another place: "What say I then? that the idol is anything? or that which
is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything? But the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they
sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with
devils. Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers
of the Lord’s table and of the table of devils. Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we
stronger than He? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things
are lawful for me, but all things edify not. Let no man seek his own, but every man what is
another’s. Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience
sake. But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake
that shows it, and for conscience sake: conscience, I say, not thine own, but another’s: for
why is my liberty judged of another man’s conscience? For if I be a partaker with thanksgiving,
why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? Whether, therefore, ye eat or
drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. Give none offence, neither to the
Jews, nor to the Greeks, nor to the Church of God: even as I please all men in all things not
seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be saved. Be ye followers of
me, even as I also am of Christ." 178</p>
<p>35. It is clear, then, I think, for what end we should abstain from flesh and wine. The
end is threefold: to check indulgence, which is mostly practised in this sort of food, and in
this kind of drink goes the length of intoxication; to protect weakness, on account of the
things which are sacrificed and offered in libation; and, what is most praiseworthy of all,
from love, not to offend the weakness of those more feeble than ourselves, who abstain from
these things. You, again, consider a morsel of meat unclean; whereas the apostle says that
all things are clean, but that it is evil to him that eateth with offence. And no doubt you are
defiled by such food, simply because you think it unclean. For the apostle says, "I know,
and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing common of itself: but to him
that esteemeth anything common, to him it is common." And every one can see that by
common he means unclean and defiled. But it is folly to discuss passages of Scripture with
you; for you both mislead people by promising to prove your doctrines, and those books
which possess authority to demand our homage you affirm to be corrupted by spurious in-

terpolations. Prove then to me your doctrine that flesh defiles the eater, when it is taken
without offending any one, without any weak notions, and without any excess.179</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—Why the Manichæans Prohibit the Use of Flesh.</head>
<p>36. It is worth while to take note of the whole reason for their superstitious abstinence,
which is given as follows:—Since, we are told, the member of God has been mixed with the
substance of evil, to repress it and to keep it from excessive ferocity,—for that is what you
say,—the world is made up of both natures, of good and evil, mixed together. But this part
of God is daily being set free in all parts of the world, and restored to its own domain. But
in its passage upwards as vapor from earth to heaven, it enters plants, because their roots
are fixed in the earth, and so gives fertility and strength to all herbs and shrubs. From these
animals get their food, and, where there is sexual intercourse, fetter in the flesh the member
of God, and, turning it from its proper course, they come in the way and entangle it in errors
and troubles. So then, if food consisting of vegetables and fruits comes to the saints, that
is, to the Manichæans by means of their chastity, and prayers, and psalms, whatever in it is
excellent and divine is purified, and so is entirely perfected, in order to restoration, free
from all hindrance, to its own domain. Hence you forbid people to give bread or vegetables,
or even water, which would cost nobody anything, to a beggar, if he is not a Manichæan,
lest he should defile the member of God by his sins, and obstruct its return.</p>
<p>37. Flesh, you say, is made up of pollution itself. For, according to you, some portion
of that divine part escapes in the eating of vegetables and fruits: it escapes while they undergo
the infliction of rubbing, grinding, or cooking, as also of biting or chewing. It escapes, too,
in all motions of animals, in the carriage of burdens, in exercise, in toil, or in any sort of
action. It escapes, too, in our rest, when digestion is going on in the body by means of internal
heat. And as the divine nature escapes in all these ways, some very unclean dregs
remain, from which, in sexual intercourse, flesh is formed. These dregs, however, fly off,
in the motions above mentioned, along with what is good in the soul; for though it is mostly,
it is not entirely good. So, when the soul has left the flesh, the dregs are utterly filthy, and
the soul of those who eat flesh is defiled.</p>

precisely because the things spoken of are invisible, and are presented to the mind under
the form of visible things, and can be eloquently expressed? Men of this description exist
in numbers and in droves, who are kept from being led away into these errors more by a
fear grounded on religious feeling than by reason. I will therefore endeavor, as God may
please to enable me, so to refute these errors, as that their falsehood and absurdity will be
manifest not only in the judgment of the wise, who reject them on hearing them, but also
to the intelligence of the multitude.</p>
<p>39. Tell me then, first, where you get the doctrine that part of God, as you call it, exists
in corn, beans, cabbage, and flowers and fruits. From the beauty of the color, say they, and
the sweetness of the taste; this is evident; and as these are not found in rotten substances,
we learn that their good has been taken from them. Are they not ashamed to attribute the
finding of God to the nose and the palate? But I pass from this. For I will speak, using words
in their proper sense; and, as the saying is, this is not so easy in speaking to you. Let us see
rather what sort of mind is required to understand this; how, if the presence of good in
bodies is shown by their color, the dung of animals, the refuse of flesh itself, has all kinds
of bright colors, sometimes white, often golden; and so on, though these are what you take
in fruits and flowers as proofs of the presence and indwelling of God. Why is it that in a
rose you hold the red color to be an indication of an abundance of good, while the same
color in blood you condemn? Why do you regard with pleasure in a violet the same color
which you turn away from in cases of cholera, or of people with jaundice, or in the excrement
of infants? Why do you believe the light, shining appearance of oil to be a sign of a plentiful
admixture of good, which you readily set about purifying by taking the oil into your throats
and stomachs, while you are afraid to touch your lips with a drop of fat, though it has the
same shining appearance as oil? Why do you look upon a yellow melon as part of the
treasures of God, and not rancid bacon fat or the yolk of an egg? Why do you think that
whiteness in a lettuce proclaims God, and not in milk? So much for colors, as regards which
(to mention nothing else) you cannot compare any flower-clad meadow with the wings and
feathers of a single peacock, though these are of flesh and of fleshly origin.</p>
<p>40. Again, if this good is discovered also by smell, perfumes of excellent smell are made
from the flesh of some animals. And the smell of food, when cooked along with flesh of
delicate flavor, is better than if cooked without it. Once more, if you think that the things
that have a better smell than others are therefore cleaner, there is a kind of mud which you
ought to take to your meals instead of water from the cistern; for dry earth moistened with
rain has an odor most agreeable to the sense, and this sort of mud has a better smell than

<pb n="140"/>
rain-water taken by itself. But if we must have the authority of taste to prove the presence
in any object of part of God, he must dwell in dates and honey more than in pork, but more
in pork than in beans. I grant that He dwells more in a fig than in a liver; but then you must
allow that He is more in liver than in beet. And, on this principle, must you not confess
that some plants, which none of you can doubt to be cleaner than flesh, receive God from
this very flesh, if we are to think of God as mixed with the flavor? For both cabbages taste
better when cooked along with flesh; and, while we cannot relish the plants on which cattle
feed, when these are turned into milk we think them improved in color, and find them very
agreeable to the taste.</p>
<p>41. Or must we think that good is to be found in greater quantity where the three good
qualities—a good color, and smell, and taste—are found together? Then you must not admire
and praise flowers so much, as you cannot admit them to be tried at the tribunal of the palate.
At least you must not prefer purslain to flesh, since flesh when cooked is superior in color,
smell, and taste. A young pig roasted (for your ideas on this subject force us to discuss good
and evil with you as if you were cooks and confectioners, instead of men of reading or literary
taste) is bright in color, and agreeable in smell, and pleasant in taste. Here is a perfect
evidence of the presence of the divine substance. You are invited by this threefold testimony,
and called on to purify this substance by your sanctity. Make the attack. Why do you hold
back? What objection have you to make. In color alone the excrement of an infant surpasses
lentils; in smell alone a roast morsel surpasses a soft green fig; in taste alone a kid when
slaughtered surpasses the plant which it fed on when alive: and we have found a kind of
flesh in flavor of which all three give evidence. What more do you require? What reply will
you make? Why should eating meat make you unclean, if using such monstrosities in discussion
does not? And, above all, the rays of the sun, which you surely think more of than
all animal or vegetable food, have no smell or taste, and are remarkable among other substances
only by their eminently bright color; which is a loud call to you, and an obligation,
in spite of yourselves, to place nothing higher than a bright color among the evidences of
an admixture of good.</p>
<p>42. Thus you are forced into this difficulty, that you must acknowledge the part of God
as dwelling more in blood, and in the filthy but bright-colored animal refuse which is thrown
out in the streets, than in the pale leaves of the olive. If you reply, as you actually do, that
olive leaves when burnt give out a flame, which proves the presence of light, while flesh
when burnt does not, what will you say of oil, which lights nearly all the lamps in Italy?
What of cow dung (which surely is more unclean than the flesh), which peasants use when
dry as fuel, so that the fire is always at hand, and the liberation of the smoke is always going
on? And if brightness and lustre prove a greater presence of the divine part, why do you
yourselves not purify it, why not appropriate it, why not liberate it? For it is found chiefly
in flowers, not to speak of blood and countless things almost the same as blood in flesh or

<pb n="141"/>
coming from it, and yet you cannot feed on flowers. And even if you were to eat flesh, you
would certainly not take with your gruel the scales of fish, or some worms and flies, though
these all shine with a light of their own in the dark.</p>
<p>43. What then remains, but that you should cease saying that you have in your eyes,
nose, and palate sufficient means of testing the presence of the divine part in material objects?
And, without these means, how can you tell not only that there is a greater part of God in
plants than in flesh, but that there is any part in plants at all? Are you led to think this by
their beauty—not the beauty of agreeable color, but that of agreement of parts? An excellent
reason, in my opinion. For you will never be so bold as to compare twisted pieces of wood
with the bodies of animals, which are formed of members answering to one another. But
if you choose the testimony of the senses, as those must do who cannot see with their mind
the full force of existence, how do you prove that the substance of good escapes from bodies
in course of time, and by some kind of attrition, but because God has gone out of it, according
to your view, and has left one place for another? The whole is absurd. But, as far as I can
judge, there are no marks or appearances to give rise to this opinion. For many things
plucked from trees, or pulled out of the ground, are the better of some interval of time before
we use them for food, as leeks and endive, lettuce, grapes, apples, figs, and some pears; and
there are many other things which get a better color when they are not used immediately
after being plucked, besides being more wholesome for the body, and having a finer flavor
to the palate. But these things should not possess all these excellent and agreeable qualities,
if, as you say, they become more destitute of good the longer they are kept after separation
from their mother earth. Animal food itself is better and more fit for use the day after the
animal is killed; but this should not be, if, as you hold, it possessed more good immediately
after the slaughter than next day, when more of the divine substance had escaped.</p>
<p>44. Who does not know that wine becomes purer and better by age? Nor is it, as you
think, more tempting to the destruction of the senses, but more useful for invigorating the
body,—only let there be moderation, which ought to control everything. The senses are
sooner destroyed by new wine. When the must has been only a short time in the vat, and
has begun to ferment, it makes those who look down into it fall headlong, affecting their
brain, so that without assistance they would perish. And as regards health, every one knows
that bodies are swollen up and injuriously distended by new wine? Has it these bad properties
because there is more good in it? Are they not found in wine when old because a good deal
of the divine substance has gone? An absurd thing to say, especially for you, who prove the
divine presence by the pleasing effect produced on your eyes, nose, and palate! And what
a contradiction it is to make wine the poison of the princes of darkness, and yet to eat grapes!
Has it more of the poison when in the cup than when in the cluster? Or if the evil remains
unmixed after the good is gone, and that by the process of time, how is it that the same
grapes, when hung up for awhile, become milder, sweeter, and more wholesome? or how

<pb n="142"/>
does the wine itself, as already mentioned, become purer and brighter when the light has
gone, and more wholesome by the loss of the beneficial substance?</p>
<p>45. What are we to say of wood and leaves, which in course of time become dry, but
cannot be the worse on that account in your estimation? For while they lose that which
produces smoke, they retain that from which a bright flame arises; and, to judge by the
clearness, which you think so much of, there is more good in the dry than in the green.
Hence you must either deny that there is more of God in the pure light than in the smoky
one, which will upset all your evidences; or you must allow it to be possible that, when plants
are plucked up, or branches plucked off, and kept for a time, more of the nature of evil may
escape from them than of the nature of good. And, on the strength of this, we shall hold
that more evil may go off from plucked fruits; and so more good may remain in animal
food. So much on the subject of time.</p>
<p>46. As for motion, and tossing, and rubbing, if these give the divine nature the opportunity
of escaping from these substances, many things of the same kind are against you,
which are improved by motion. In some grains the juice resembles wine, and is excellent
when moved about. Indeed, as must not be overlooked, this kind of drink produces intoxication
rapidly; and yet you never called the juice of grain the poison of the princes of
darkness. There is a preparation of water, thickened with a little meal, which is the better
of being shaken, and, strange to say, is lighter in color when the light is gone. The pastry
cook stirs honey for a long time to give it this light color, and to make its sweetness milder
and less unwholesome: you must explain how this can come from the loss of good. Again,
if you prefer to test the presence of God by the agreeable effects on the hearing, and not
sight, or smell, or taste, harps get their strings and pipes their bones from animals; and these
become musical by being dried, and rubbed, and twisted. So the pleasures of music, which
you hold to have come from the divine kingdom, are obtained from the refuse of dead animals,
and that, too, when they are dried by time, and lessened by rubbing, and stretched
by twisting. Such rough treatment, according to you, drives the divine substance from living
objects; even cooking them, you say, does this. Why then are boiled thistles not unwholesome?
Is it because God, or part of God, leaves them when they are cooked?</p>
<p>47. Why mention all the particulars, when it is difficult to enumerate them? Nor is it
necessary; for every one knows how many things are sweeter and more wholesome when
cooked. This ought not to be, if, as you suppose, things lose the good by being thus moved
about. I do not suppose that you will find any proof from your bodily senses that flesh is
unclean, and defiles the souls of those who eat it, because fruits, when plucked and shaken
about in various ways, become flesh; especially as you hold that vinegar, in its age and fermentation,
is cleaner than wine, and the mead you drink is nothing else than cooked wine,
which ought to be more impure than wine, if material things lose the divine members by
being moved about and cooked. But if not, you have no reason to think that fruits, when

<pb n="143"/>
plucked, kept, handled, cooked, and digested, are forsaken by the good, and therefore supply
most unclean matter for the formation of bodies.</p>
<p>48. But if it is not from their color and appearance, and smell and taste, that you think
the good to be in these things, what else can you bring forward? Do you prove it from the
strength and vigor which those things seem to lose when they are separated from the earth
and put to use? If this is your reason (though its erroneousness is seen at once, from the
fact that the strength of some things is increased after their separation from the earth, as in
the case already mentioned of wine, which becomes stronger from age),—if the strength,
then, is your reason, it would follow that the part of God is to be found in no food more
abundantly than in flesh. For athletes, who especially require vigor and energy, are not in
the habit of feeding on cabbage and fruit without animal food.</p>
<p>49. Is your reason for thinking the bodies of trees better than our bodies, that flesh is
nourished by trees and not trees by flesh. You forget the obvious fact that plants, when
manured with dung, become richer and more fertile and crops heavier, though you think
it your gravest charge against flesh that it is the abode of dung. This then gives nourishment
to things you consider clean, though it is, according to you, the most unclean part of what
you consider unclean. But if you dislike flesh because it springs from sexual intercourse,
you should be pleased with the flesh of worms, which are bred in such numbers, and of such
a size, in fruits, in wood, and in the earth itself, without any sexual intercourse. But there
is some insincerity in this. For if you were displeased with flesh because it is formed from
the cohabitation of father and mother, you would not say that those princes of darkness
were born from the fruits of their own trees; for no doubt you think worse of these princes
than of flesh, which you refuse to eat.</p>
<p>50. Your idea that all the souls of animals come from the food of their parents, from
which confinement you pretend to liberate the divine substance which is held bound in
your viands, is quite inconsistent with your abstinence from flesh, and makes it a pressing
duty for you to eat animal food. For if souls are bound in the body by those who eat animal
food, why do you not secure their liberation by being beforehand in eating the food? You
reply, it is not from the animal food that the good part comes which those people bring into
bondage, but from the vegetables which they take with their meat. What will you say then
of the souls of lions, who feed only on flesh? They drink, is the reply, and so the soul is
drawn in from the water and confined in flesh. But what of birds without number? What
of eagles, which eat only flesh, and need no drink? Here you are at a loss, and can find no
answer. For if the soul comes from food, and there are animals which neither drink anything
nor have any food but flesh, and yet bring forth young, there must be some soul in flesh;
and you are bound to try your plan of purifying it by eating the flesh. Or will you say that

<pb n="144"/>
a pig has a soul of light, because it eats vegetables, and drinks water; and that the eagle, because
it eats only flesh, has a soul of darkness, though it is so fond of the sun?180</p>
<p>51. What a confusion of ideas! What amazing fatuity! All this you would have escaped,
if you had rejected idle fictions, and had followed what truth sanctions in abstinence from
food, which would have taught you that sumptuous eating is to be avoided, not to escape
pollution, as there is nothing of the kind, but to subdue the sensual appetite. For should
any one, from inattention to the nature of things, and the properties of the soul and body,
allow that the soul is polluted by animal food, you will admit that it is much much more
defiled by sensuality. Is it reasonable, then, or rather, is it not most unreasonable, to expel
from the number of the elect a man who, perhaps for his health’s sake, takes some animal
food without sensual appetite; while, if a man eagerly devours peppered truffles, you can
only reprove him for excess, but cannot condemn him as abusing your symbol? So one who
has been induced, not by sensuality, but for health, to eat part of a fowl, cannot remain
among your elect; though one may remain who has yielded voluntarily to an excessive appetite
for comfits and cakes without animal matter. You retain the man plunged in the defilements
of sensuality, and dismiss the man polluted, as you think, by the mere food; though
you allow that the defilement of sensuality is far greater than that of meat. You keep hold
of one who gloats with delight over highly-seasoned vegetables, unable to keep possession
of himself; while you shut out one who, to satisfy hunger, takes whatever comes, if suitable
for nourishment, ready either to use the food, or to let it go. Admirable customs! Excellent
morals! Notable temperance!</p>
<p>52. Again, the notion that it is unlawful for any one but the elect to touch as food what
is brought to your meals for what you call purification, leads to shameful and sometimes to
criminal practices. For sometimes so much is brought that it cannot easily be eaten up by
a few; and as it is considered sacrilege to give what is left to others, or, at least, to throw it
away, you are obliged to eat to excess, from the desire to purify, as you call it, all that is given.
Then, when you are full almost to bursting, you cruelly use force in making the boys of your
sect eat the rest. So it was charged against some one at Rome that he killed some poor
children, by compelling them to eat for this superstitious reason. This I should not believe,
did I not know how sinful you consider it to give this food to those who are not elect, or, at
any rate, to throw it away. So the only way is to eat it; and this leads every day to gluttony,
and may sometimes lead to murder.</p>
<p>53. For the same reason you forbid giving bread to beggars. By way of showing compassion,
or rather of avoiding reproach, you advise to give money. The cruelty of this is
<note type="footnote">180 [Much of the foregoing, as well as of what follows, seems to the modern reader like mere trifling, but
Augustin’s aim was by introducing many familiar illustrations to show the utter absurdity of the Manichæan
distinctions between clean and unclean. It must be confessed that he does this very effectively.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="145"/>
equalled by its stupidity. For suppose a place where food cannot be purchased: the beggar
will die of starvation, while you, in your wisdom and benevolence, have more mercy on a
cucumber than on a human being! This is in truth (for how could it be better designated)
pretended compassion, and real cruelty. Then observe the stupidity. What if the beggar
buys bread for himself with the money you give him? Will the divine part, as you call it,
not suffer the same in him when he buys the food as it would have suffered if he had taken
it as a gift from you? So this sinful beggar plunges in corruption part of God eager to escape,
and is aided in this crime by your money! But you in your great sagacity think it enough
that you do not give to one about to commit murder a man to kill, though you knowingly
give him money to procure somebody to be killed. Can any madness go beyond this? The
result is, that either the man dies if he cannot get food for his money, or the food itself dies
if he gets it. The one is true murder; the other what you call murder: though in both cases
you incur the guilt of real murder. Again, there is the greatest folly and absurdity in allowing
your followers to eat animal food, while you forbid them to kill animals. If this food does
not defile, take it yourselves. If it defiles, what can be more unreasonable than to think it
more sinful to separate the soul of a pig from its body than to defile the soul of a man with
the pig’s flesh.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
<pb n="146"/>
<head>Chapter 17.—Description of the Symbol of the Hands Among the Manichæans.</head>
<p>54. We must now notice and discuss the symbol of the hands. And, in the first place,
your abstaining from the slaughter of animals and from injuring plants is shown by Christ
to be mere superstition; for, on the ground that there is no community of rights between
us and brutes and trees, He both sent the devils into an herd of swine,181 and withered by
His curse a tree in which He had found no fruit.182 The swine assuredly had not sinned,
nor had the tree. We are not so insane as to think that a tree is fruitful or barren by its own
choice. Nor is it any reply to say that our Lord wished in these actions to teach some other
truths; for every one knows that. But assuredly the Son of God would not commit murder
to illustrate truth, if you call the destruction of a tree or of an animal murder. The signs
which Christ wrought in the case of men, with whom we certainly have a community of
rights, were in healing, not in killing them. And it would have been the same in the case of
beasts and trees, if we had that community with them which you imagine.</p>
<p>55. I think it right to refer here to the authority of Scripture, because we cannot here
enter on a profound discussion about the soul of animals, or the kind of life in trees. But
as you preserve the right to call the Scriptures corrupted, in case you should find them too
strongly opposed to you,—although you have never affirmed the passages about the tree
and the herd of swine to be spurious,—still, lest some day you should wish to say this of
them too, when you find how much they are against you, I will adhere to my plan, and will
ask you, who are so liberal in your promises of evidence and truth, to tell me first what harm
is done to a tree, I say not by plucking a leaf or an apple,—for which, however, one of you
would be condemned at once as having abused the symbol, if he did it intentionally, and
not accidentally,—but if you tear it up by the root. For the soul in trees, which, according
to you, is a rational soul, is, in your theory, freed from bondage when the tree is cut down,—a
bondage, too, where it suffered great misery and got no profit. For it is well known that
you, in the words of your founder, threaten as a great, though not the greatest punishment,
the change from a man to a tree; and it is not probable that the soul in a tree can grow in
wisdom as it does in a man. There is the best reason for not killing a man, in case you should
kill one whose wisdom or virtue might be of use to many, or one who might have attained
to wisdom, whether by the advice of another without himself, or by divine illumination in
his own mind. And the more wisdom the soul has when it leaves the body, the more profitable
is its departure, as we know both from well-grounded reasoning and from wide-spread
belief. Thus to cut down a tree is to set free the soul from a body in which it makes no
progress in wisdom. You—the holy men, I mean—ought to be mainly occupied in cutting
down trees, and in leading the souls thus emancipated to better things by prayers and psalms.
<note type="footnote">181 Matt. viii. 32.</note>
<note type="footnote">182 Matt. xxi. 19.</note>

<pb n="147"/>
Or can this be done only with the souls which you take into your belly, instead of aiding
them by your understanding?</p>
<p>56. And you cannot escape the admission that the souls in trees make no progress in
wisdom while they are there, when you are asked why no apostle was sent to teach trees as
well as men, or why the apostle sent to men did not preach the truth to trees also. Your
reply must be, that the souls while in such bodies cannot understand the divine precepts.
But this reply lands you in great difficulties; for you declare that these souls can hear your
voices and understand what you say, and see bodies and their motions, and even discern
thoughts. If this is true, why could they learn nothing from the apostle of light? Why could
they not learn even much better than we, since they can see into the mind? Your master,
who, as you say, has difficulty in teaching you by speech, might have taught these souls by
thought; for they could see his ideas in his mind before he expressed them. But if this is
untrue, consider into what errors you have fallen.</p>
<p>57. As for your not plucking fruits or pulling up vegetables yourselves, while you get
your followers to pluck and pull and bring them to you, that you may confer benefits not
only on those who bring the food but on the food which is brought, what thoughtful person
can bear to hear this? For, first, it matters not whether you commit a crime yourself, or
wish another to commit it for you. You deny that you wish this! How then can relief be
given to the divine part contained in lettuce and leeks, unless some one pull them and bring
them to the saints to be purified. And again, if you were passing through a field where the
right of friendship permitted you to pluck anything you wished, what would you do if you
saw a crow on the point of eating a fig? Does not, according to your ideas, the fig itself seem
to address you and to beg of you piteously to pluck it yourself and give it burial in a holy
belly, where it may be purified and restored, rather than that the crow should swallow it
and make it part of his cursed body, and then hand it over to bondage and torture in other
forms? If this is true, how cruel you are! If not, how silly! What can be more contrary to
your opinions than to break the symbol? What can be more unkind to the member of God
than to keep it?</p>
<p>58. This supposes the truth of your false and vain ideas. But you can be shown guilty
of plain and positive cruelty flowing from the same error. For were any one lying on the
road, his body wasted with disease, weary with journeying, and half-dead from his sufferings,
and able only to utter some broken words, and if eating a pear would do him good as an
astringent, and were he to beg you to help him as you passed by, and were he to implore
you to bring the fruit from a neighboring tree, with no divine or human prohibition to
prevent your doing so, while the man is sure to die for the want of it, you, a Christian man
and a saint, will rather pass on and abandon a man thus suffering and entreating, lest the
tree should lament the loss of its fruit, and you should be doomed to the punishment

<pb n="148"/>
threatened by Manichæus for breaking the symbol. Strange customs, and strange harmlessness!</p>
<p>59. Now, as regards killing animals, and the reasons for your opinion, much that has
been said will apply also to this. For what harm will be done to the soul of a wolf by killing
the wolf, since the wolf, as long as it lives, will be a wolf, and will not listen to any preacher,
or give up, in the least, shedding the blood of sheep; and, by killing it, the rational soul, as
you think, will be set free from its confinement in the body? But you make this slaughter
unlawful even for your followers; for you think it worse than that of trees. And in this there
is not much fault to be found with your senses,—that is, your bodily senses. For we see and
hear by their cries that animals die with pain, although man disregards this in a beast, with
which, as not having a rational soul, we have no community of rights. But as to your senses
in the observation of trees, you must be entirely blind. For not to mention that there are
no movements in the wood expressive of pain, what is clearer than that a tree is never better
than when it is green and flourishing, gay with flowers, and rich in fruit? And this comes
generally and chiefly from pruning. But if it felt the iron, as you suppose, it ought to die of
wounds so many, so severe, instead of sprouting at the places, and reviving with such
manifest delight.</p>
<p>60. But why do you think it a greater crime to destroy animals than plants, although
you hold that plants have a purer soul than animals? There is a compensation, we are told,
when part of what is taken from the fields is given to the elect and the saints to be purified.
This has already been refuted; and it has, I think, been proved sufficiently that there is no
reason for saying that more of the good part is found in vegetables than in flesh. But should
any one support himself by selling butcher-meat, and spend the whole profit of his business
in purchasing food for your elect, and bring larger supplies for those saints than any peasant
or farmer, will he not plead this compensation as a warrant for his killing animals? But
there is, we are told, some other mysterious reason; for a cunning man can always find some
resource in the secrets of nature when addressing unlearned people. The story, then, is that
the heavenly princes who were taken from the race of darkness and bound, and have a place
assigned them in this region by the Creator of the world, have animals on the earth specially
belonging to them, each having those coming from his own stock and class; and they hold
the slaughterers of those animals guilty, and do not allow them to leave the earth, but harass
them as much as they can with pains and torments. What simple man will not be frightened
by this, and, seeing nothing in the darkness shrouding these things, will not think that the
fact is as described? But I will hold to my purpose, with God’s help, to rebut mysterious
falsehood by the plainest truth.</p>
<p>61. Tell me, then, if animals on land and in water come in regular succession by ordinary
generation from this race of princes, since the origin of animal life is traced to the abortive
births in that race;—tell me, I say, whether bees and frogs, and many other creatures not

<pb n="149"/>
sprung from sexual intercourse,183 may be killed with impunity. We are told they cannot.
So it is not on account of their relation to certain princes that you forbid your followers to
kill animals. Or if you make a general relationship to all bodies, the princes would be equally
concerned about trees, which you do not require your followers to spare. You are brought
back to the weak reply, that the injuries done in the case of plants are atoned for by the fruits
which your followers bring to your church. For this implies that those who slaughter animals,
and sell their flesh in the market, if they are your followers, and if they bring to you vegetables
bought with their gains, may think nothing of the daily slaughter, and are cleared of any sin
that may be in it by your repasts.</p>
<p>62. But if you say that, in order to expiate the slaughter, the thing must be given as food,
as in the case of fruits and vegetables,—which cannot be done, because the elect do not eat
flesh, and so your followers must not slaughter animals,—what reply will you give in the
case of thorns and weeds, which farmers destroy in clearing their fields, while they cannot
bring any food to you from them? How can there be pardon for such destruction, which
gives no nourishment to the saints? Perhaps you also put away any sin committed, for the
benefit of the fruits and vegetables, by eating some of these. What then if the fields are
plundered by locusts, mice, or rats, as we see often happen? Can your rustic follower kill
these with impunity, because he sins for the good of his crops? Here you are at a loss; for
you either allow your followers to kill animals, which your founder prohibited, or you forbid
them to be cultivators, which he made lawful. Indeed, you sometimes go so far as to say
that an usurer is more harmless than a cultivator,—you feel so much more for melons than
for men. Rather than hurt the melons, you would have a man ruined as a debtor. Is this
desirable and praiseworthy justice, or not rather atrocious and damnable error? Is this
commendable compassion, or not rather detestable barbarity?</p>
<p>63. What, again, of your not abstaining yourselves from the slaughter of lice, bugs, and
fleas? You think it a sufficient excuse for this to say that these are the dirt of our bodies.
But this is clearly untrue of fleas and bugs; for every one knows that these animals do not
come from our bodies. Besides, if you abhor sexual intercourse as much as you pretend to
do, you should think those animals all the cleaner which come from our bodies without any
other generation; for although they produce offspring of their own, they are not produced
in ordinary generation from us. Again, if we must consider as most filthy the production
of living bodies, still worse must be the production of dead bodies. There must be less harm,
therefore, in killing a rat, a snake, or a scorpion, which you constantly say come from our
dead bodies. But to pass over what is less plain and certain, it is a common opinion regarding
bees that they come from the carcases of oxen; so there is no harm in killing them. Or if
<note type="footnote">183 [This is, of course, a physiological blunder, but Augustin doubtless states what was the common view at
the time.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="150"/>
this too is doubted, every one allows that beetles, at least, are bred in the ball of mud which
they make and bury.184 You ought therefore to consider these animals, and others that it
would be tedious to specify, more unclean than your lice; and yet you think it sinful to kill
them, though it would be foolish not to kill the lice. Perhaps you hold the lice cheap because
they are small. But if an animal is to be valued by its size, you must prefer a camel to a man.</p>
<p>64. Here we may use the gradation which often perplexed us when we were your followers.
For if a flea may be killed on account of its small size, so may the fly which is bred in
beans. And if this, so also may one of a little larger size, for its size at birth is even less.
Then again, a bee may be killed, for its young is no larger than a fly. So on to the young of
a locust, and to a locust; and then to the young of a mouse, and to a mouse. And, to cut
short, it is clear we may come at last to an elephant; so that one who thinks it no sin to kill
a flea, because of its small size, must allow that it would be no sin in him to kill this huge
creature. But I think enough has been said of these absurdities.</p>

<head>Chapter 18.—Of the Symbol of the Breast, and of the Shameful Mysteries of the
Manichæans.</head>
<p>65. Lastly, there is the symbol of the breast, in which your very questionable chastity
consists. For though you do not forbid sexual intercourse, you, as the apostle long ago said,
forbid marriage in the proper sense, although this is the only good excuse for such intercourse.
No doubt you will exclaim against this, and will make it a reproach against us that
you highly esteem and approve perfect chastity, but do not forbid marriage, because your
followers—that is, those in the second grade among you—are allowed to have wives. After
you have said this with great noise and heat, I will quietly ask, Is it not you who hold that
begetting children, by which souls are confined in flesh, is a greater sin than cohabitation?
Is it not you who used to counsel us to observe as much as possible the time when a woman,
after her purification, is most likely to conceive, and to abstain from cohabitation at that
time, lest the soul should be entangled in flesh? This proves that you approve of having a
wife, not for the procreation of children, but for the gratification of passion. In marriage,
as the marriage law declares, the man and woman come together for the procreation of
children. Therefore whoever makes the procreation of children a greater sin than copulation,
forbids marriage, and makes the woman not a wife, but a mistress, who for some gifts
presented to her is joined to the man to gratify his passion. Where there is a wife there must
be marriage. But there is no marriage where motherhood is not in view; therefore neither
is there a wife. In this way you forbid marriage. Nor can you defend yourselves successfully
from this charge, long ago brought against you prophetically by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>66. Moreover, when you are so eager in your desire to prevent the soul from being
confined in flesh by conjugal intercourse, and so eager in asserting that the soul is set free
from seed by the food of the saints, do you not sanction, unhappy beings, the suspicion entertained
about you? For why should it be true regarding corn and beans and lentils and
other seeds, that when you eat them you wish to set free the soul, and not true of the seeds
of animals? For what you say of the flesh of a dead animal, that it is unclean because there
is no soul in it, cannot be said of the seed of the animal; for you hold that it keeps confined
the soul which will appear in the offspring, and you avow that the soul of Manichæus himself
is thus confined. And as your followers cannot bring these seeds to you for purification,
who will not suspect that you make this purification secretly among yourselves, and hide it
from your followers, in case they should leave you?185 If you do not these things, as it is to
be hoped you do not, still you see how open to suspicion your superstition is, and how impossible
it is to blame men for thinking what your own profession suggests, when you
<note type="footnote">185 [Compare what is said about the disgusting ceremonial of Ischas by Cyril of Jerusalem (Cat. vi.), Augustin
(Haeres. xlvi.), Pope Leo X. (Serm. V. de Jejuniis, X. Mens.). These charges were probably unfounded, though
they are not altogether out of harmony with the Manichæan principles.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="152"/>
maintain that you set free souls from bodies and from senses by eating and drinking. I wish
to say no more about this: you see yourselves what room there is here for denunciation.
But as the matter is one rather to repress than to invite remark, and also as throughout my
discourse my purpose appears of exaggerating nothing, and of keeping to bare facts and
arguments, we shall pass on to other matters.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
<pb n="153"/>
<head>Chapter 19.—Crimes of the Manichæans.</head>
<p>67. We see then, now, the nature of your three symbols. These are your customs. This
is the end of your notable precepts, in which there is nothing sure, nothing steadfast, nothing
consistent, nothing irreproachable, but all doubtful, or rather undoubtedly and entirely
false, all contradictory, abominable, absurd. In a word, evil practices are detected in your
customs so many and so serious, that one wishing to denounce them all, if he were at all
able to enlarge, would require at least a separate treatise for each. Were you to observe these,
and to act up to your profession, no childishness, or folly, or absurdity would go beyond
yours; and when you praise and teach these things without doing them, you display craft
and deceit and malevolence equal to anything that can be described or imagined.</p>
<p>68. During nine full years that I attended you with great earnestness and assiduity, I
could not hear of one of your elect who was not found transgressing these precepts, or at
least was not suspected of doing so. Many were caught at wine and animal food, many at
the baths; but this we only heard by report. Some were proved to have seduced other men’s
wives, so that in this case I could not doubt the truth of the charge. But suppose this, too,
a report rather than a fact. I myself saw, and not I only, but others who have either escaped
from that superstition, or will, I hope, yet escape,—we saw, I say, in a square in Carthage,
on a road much frequented, not one, but more than three of the elect walking behind us,
and accosting some women with such indecent sounds and gestures as to outdo the boldness
and insolence of all ordinary rascals. And it was clear that this was quite habitual, and that
they behaved in this way to one another, for no one was deterred by the presence of a companion,
showing that most of them, if not all, were affected with this evil tendency. For they
did not all come from one house, but lived in quite different places, and quite accidentally
left together the place where they had met. It was a great shock to us, and we lodged a
complaint about it. But who thought of inflicting punishment,—I say not by separation
from the church, but even by severe rebuke in proportion to the heinousness of the offence?</p>
<p>69. All the excuse given for the impunity of those men was that, at that time, when their
meetings were forbidden by law, it was feared that the persons suffering punishment might
retaliate by giving information. What then of their assertion that they will always have
persecution in this world, for which they suppose that they will be thought the more of? for
this is the application they make of the words about the world hating them. 186 And they
will have it that truth must be sought for among them, because, in the promise of the Holy
Spirit, the Paraclete, it is said that the world cannot receive Him.187 This is not the place
<note type="footnote">186 John xv. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">187 John xiv. 17.</note>

<pb n="154"/>
to discuss this question. But clearly, if you are always to be persecuted, even to the end of
the world, there will be no end to this laxity, and to the unchecked spread of all this immorality,
from your fear of giving offence to men of this character.</p>
<p>70. This answer was also given to us, when we reported to the very highest authorities
that a woman had complained to us that in a meeting, where she was along with other women,
not doubting of the sanctity of these people, some of the elect came in, and when one of
them had put out the lamp, one, whom she could not distinguish, tried to embrace her, and
would have forced her into sin, had she not escaped by crying out. How common must we
conclude the practice to have been which led to the misdeed on this occasion! And this was
done on the night when you keep the feast of vigils. Forsooth, besides the fear of information
being given, no one could bring the offender before the bishop, as he had so well guarded
against being recognized. As if all who entered along with him were not implicated in the
crime; for in their indecent merriment they all wished the lamp to be put out.</p>
<p>71. Then what wide doors were opened for suspicions, when we saw them full of envy,
full of covetousness, full of greed for costly foods, constantly at strife, easily excited about
trifles! We concluded that they were not competent to abstain from the things they professed
to abstain from, if they found an opportunity in secret or in the dark. There were two of
sufficiently good character, of active minds, and leaders in their debates, with whom we had
a more particular and intimate acquaintance than with the rest. One of them was much
associated with us, because he was also engaged in liberal studies; he is said to be now an
elder there. These two were very jealous of one another, and one accused the other—not
openly, but in conversation, as he had opportunity, and in whispers—of having made a
criminal assault on the wife of one of the followers. He again, in clearing himself to us,
brought the same charge against another of the elect, who lived with this follower as his
most trusted friend. He had, going in suddenly, caught this man with the woman, and his
enemy and rival had advised the woman and her paramour to raise this false report about
him, that he might not be believed if he gave any information. We were much distressed,
and took it greatly to heart, that although there was a doubt about the assault on the woman,
the jealous feeling in those two men, than whom we found none better in the place, showed
itself so keenly, and inevitably raised a suspicion of other things.188</p>
<p>72. Another thing was, that we very often saw in theatres men belonging to the elect,
men of years and, it was supposed, of character, along with a hoary-headed elder. We pass
over the youths, whom we used to come upon quarrelling about the people connected with
the stage and the races; from which we may safely conclude how they would be able to refrain
in secret, when they could not subdue the passion by which they were exposed in the eyes
<note type="footnote">188 Doubtless Augustin exaggerates the immorality of the Manichæans; but there must have been a considerable
basis of fact for his charges.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="155"/>
of their followers, bringing on them disgrace and flight. In the case of the saint, whose discussions
we attended in the street of the fig-sellers, would his atrocious crime have been
discovered if he had been able to make the dedicated virgin his wife without making her
pregnant? The swelling womb betrayed the secret and unthought-of iniquity. When her
brother, a young man, heard of it from his mother, he felt keenly the injury, but refrained,
from regard to religion, from a public accusation. He succeeded in getting the man expelled
from that church, for such conduct cannot always be tolerated; and that the crime might
not be wholly unpunished, he arranged with some of his friends to have the man well beaten
and kicked. When he was thus assailed, he cried out that they should spare him, from regard
to the authority of the opinion of Manichæus, that Adam the first hero had sinned, and was
a greater saint after his sin.</p>
<p>73. This, in fact, is your notion about Adam and Eve.189 It is a long story; but I will
touch only on what concerns the present matter. You say that Adam was produced from
his parents, the abortive princes of darkness; that he had in his soul the most part of light,
and very little of the opposite race. So while he lived a holy life, on account of the prevalence
of good, still the opposite part in him was stirred up, so that he was led away into conjugal
intercourse. Thus he fell and sinned, but afterwards lived in greater holiness. Now, my
complaint is not so much about this wicked man, who, under the garb of an elect and holy
man, brought such shame and reproach on a family of strangers by his shocking immorality.
I do not charge you with this. Let it be attributed to the abandoned character of the man,
and not to your habits. I blame the man for the atrocity, and not you. Still there is this in
you all that cannot, as far as I can see, be admitted or tolerated, that while you hold the soul
to be part of God, you still maintain that the mixture of a little evil prevailed over the superior
force and quantity of good. Who that believes this, when incited by passion, will not
find here an excuse, instead of checking and controlling his passion?</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Disgraceful Conduct Discovered at Rome.</head>
<p>74. What more shall I say of your customs? I have mentioned what I found myself
when I was in the city when the things were done. To go through all that happened at Rome
in my absence would take a long time. I will, however, give a short account of it; for the
matter became so notorious, that even the absent could not remain in ignorance of it. And
when I was afterwards in Rome, I ascertained the truth of all I had heard, although the story
was told me by an eye-witness whom I knew so well and esteemed so highly, that I could
not feel any doubt about it. One of your followers, then, quite equal to the elect in their farfamed
abstinence, for he was both liberally educated, and was in the habit of defending your
sect with great zeal, took it very ill that he had cast in his teeth the vile conduct of the elect,
who lived in all kinds of places, and went hither and thither for lodging of the worst description.
He therefore desired, if possible, to assemble all who were willing to live according to
the precepts into his own house, and to maintain them at his own expense; for he was above
the average in carelessness as to spending money, besides being above the average in the
amount he had to spend. He complained that his efforts were hindered by the remissness
of the bishops, whose assistance he required for success. At last one of your bishops was
found,—a man, as I know, very rude and unpolished, but somehow, from his very moroseness,
the more inclined to strict observance of morality. The follower eagerly lays hold of
this man as the person he had long wished for and found at last, and relates his whole plan.
He approves and assents, and agrees to be the first to take up his abode in the house. When
this was done, all the elect who could be at Rome were assembled there. The rule of life in
the epistle of Manichæus was laid before them. Many thought it intolerable, and left; not a
few felt ashamed, and stayed. They began to live as they had agreed, and as this high authority
enjoined. The follower all the time was zealously enforcing everything on everybody, though
never, in any case, what he did not undertake himself. Meanwhile quarrels constantly arose
among the elect. They charged one another with crimes, all which he lamented to hear, and
managed to make them unintentionally expose one another in their altercations. The revelations
were vile beyond description. Thus appeared the true character of those who were
unlike the rest in being willing to bend to the yoke of the precepts. What then is to be suspected,
or rather, concluded, of the others? To come to a close, they gathered together on
one occasion and complained that they could not keep the regulations. Then came rebellion.
The follower stated his case most concisely, that either all must be kept, or the man who
had given such a sanction to such precepts, which no one could fulfill, must be thought a
great fool. But, as was inevitable, the wild clamor of the mob prevailed over the opinion of
one man. The bishop himself gave way at last, and took to flight with great disgrace; and
he was said to have got in provisions by stealth, contrary to rule, which were often discovered.
He had a supply of money from his private purse, which he carefully kept concealed.</p>

<pb n="157"/>
<p>75. If you say these things are false, you contradict what is too clear and public. But
you may say so if you like. For, as the things are certain, and easily known by those who
wish to know them, those who deny that they are true show what their habit of telling the
truth is. But you have other replies with which I do not find fault. For you either say that
some do keep your precepts, and that they should not be mixed up with the guilty in condemning
the others; or that the whole inquiry into the character of the members of your
sect is wrong, for the question is of the character of the profession. Should I grant both of
these (although you can neither point out those faithful observers of the precepts, nor clear
your heresy of all those frivolities and iniquities), still I must insist on knowing why you
heap reproaches on Christians of the Catholic name on seeing the immoral life of some,
while you either have the effrontery to repel inquiry about your members, or the still
greater effrontery not to repel it, wishing it to be understood that in your scanty membership
there are some unknown individuals who keep the precepts they profess, but that among
the multitudes in the Catholic Church there are none.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—By What Course of Reasoning the Error of the Manichæans Concerning
Two Souls, One of Which is Not from God, is Refuted. Every Soul, Inasmuch
as It is a Certain Life, Can Have Its Existence Only from God the Source of Life.</head>
<p>1. Through the assisting mercy of God, the snares of the Manichæans having been
broken to pieces and left behind, having been restored at length to the bosom of the Catholic
Church, I am disposed now at least to consider and to deplore my recent wretchedness.
For there were many things that I ought to have done to prevent the seeds of the most true
religion wholesomely implanted in me from boyhood, from being banished from my mind,
having been uprooted by the error and fraud of false and deceitful men. For, in the first
place, if I had soberly and diligently considered, with prayerful and pious mind, those two
kinds of souls to which they attributed natures and properties so distinct that they wished
one to be regarded as of the very substance of God, but were not even willing that God
should be accepted as the author of the other; perhaps it would have appeared to me, intent
on learning, that there is no life whatsoever, which, by the very fact of its being life and in
so far as it is life at all, does not pertain to the supreme source and beginning of life,191 which
<note type="footnote">190 Scarcely any one of his earlier treatises was more unsatisfactory to Augustin in his later Anti-Pelagian
years than that Concerning Two Souls. In his Retractations, Book I., chapter xv., he recognizes the rashness of
some of his statements and points out the sense in which they are tenable or the reverse. As regards the occasion
of the writing, the following may be quoted: "After this book [De Utilitate Credendi] I wrote, while still a presbyter,
against the Manichæans Concerning Two Souls, of which they say that one part is of God, the other from
the race of darkness, which God did not found, and which is coeternal with God, and they rave about both these
souls, the one good, the other evil, being in one man, saying forsooth that the evil soul on the one hand belongs
to the flesh, which flesh also they say is of the race of darkness; but that the good soul is from the part of God
that came forth, combated the race of darkness, and mingled with the latter; and they attribute all good things
in man to that good soul, and all evil things to that evil soul."—A.H.N.]</note>
<note type="footnote">191 In his Retractations, Augustin explains this proposition as follows: "I said this in the sense in which the
creature is known to pertain to the Creator, but not in the sense that it is of Him, so as to be regarded as part of
Him."—A.H.N.</note>

<pb n="160"/>
we must acknowledge to be nothing else than the supreme and only and true God.
Wherefore there is no reason why we should not confess, that those souls which the
Manichæans call evil are either devoid of life and so not souls, neither will anything positively
or negatively, neither follow after nor flee from anything; or, if they live so that they can be
souls, and act as the Manichæans suppose, in no way do they live unless by life, and if it be
an established fact, as it is, that Christ has said: "I am the life,"192 that all souls seeing that
they cannot be souls except by living were created and fashioned by Christ, that is, by the
Life.</p>

<head>Chapter 2.—If the Light that is Perceived by Sense Has God for Its Author, as the
Manichæans Acknowledge, Much More The Soul Which is Perceived by Intellect
Alone.</head>
<p>2. But if at that time193 my thought was not able to bear and sustain the question concern
ing life and partaking of life, which is truly a great question, and one that requires much
calm discussion among the learned, I might perchance have had power to discover that
which to every man considering himself, without a study of the individual parts, is perfectly
evident, namely, that everything we are said to know and to understand, we comprehend
either by bodily sense or by mental operation. That the five bodily senses are commonly
enumerated as sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, than all of which intellect is immeasurably
more noble and excellent, who would have been so ungrateful and impious as not to concede
to me; which being established and confirmed, we should have seen how it follows, that
whatsoever things are perceived by touch or sight or in any bodily manner at all, are by so
much inferior to those things that we comprehend intellectually as the senses are inferior
to the intellect. Wherefore, since all life, and so every soul, can be perceived by no bodily
sense, but by the intellect alone, whereas while yonder sun and moon and every luminary
that is beheld by these mortal eyes, the Manichæans themselves also say must be attributed
to the true and good God, it is the height of madness to claim that that belongs to God which
we observe bodily; but, on the other hand, to think that what we receive not only by the
mind, but by the highest form of mind,194 namely, reason and intellect,195 that is life,
whatsoever it may be called, nevertheless life, should be deprived and bereft of the same
God as its author. For if having invoked God, I had asked myself what living is, how inscrutable
it is to every bodily sense, how absolutely incorporeal it is, could not I have answered?
Or would not the Manichæans also confess not only that the souls they detest live, but that
they live also immortally? and that Christ’s saying: "Send the dead to bury their dead," 196
was uttered not with reference to those not living at all, but with reference to sinners, which
is the only death of the immortal soul; as when Paul writes: "The widow that giveth herself
<note type="footnote">193 It will aid the reader in following the thread of Augustin’s argument, if he will bear in mind that
throughout this treatise the writer considers the points of antagonism between Manichæism and Catholicism
from the point of view of his early entanglement in Manichæan error. Considering the opportunities that he
had for knowing the truth, the helps to have been expected from God in answer to prayer, the capacities of the
unperverted intellect to arrive at truth, he inquires how he should have guarded himself from the insinuation
of Manichæan error, how he should have defended the truth, and how he should have been the means of liberating
others.—A.H.N.</note>

to pleasure is dead while she liveth,"197 he says that she at the same time is dead, and alive.
Wherefore I should have directed attention not to the great degree of contamination in
which the sinful soul lives, but only to the fact itself that it lives. But if I cannot perceive
except by an act of intelligence, I believe it would have come into the mind, that by as much
as any mind whatever is to be preferred to the light which we see through these eyes, by so
much we should give to intellect the preference over the eyes themselves.</p>

<head>Chapter 3.—How It is Proved that Every Body Also is from God. That the Soul
Which is Called Evil by the Manichæans is Better Than Light.</head>
<p>They also affirm that the light is from the Father of Christ: should I then have doubted
that every soul is from Him? But not even then, as a man forsooth so inexperienced and so
youthful as I was, should I have been in doubt as to the derivation not only of the soul, but
also of the body, nay of everything whatsoever, from Him, if I had reverently and cautiously
reflected on what form is, or what has been formed, what shape is and what has been endued
with shape.</p>
<p>3. But not to speak at present concerning the body, I lament concerning the soul, concerning
spontaneous and vivid movement, concerning action, concerning life, concerning
immortality; in fine, I lament that I, miserable, should have believed that anything could
have all these properties apart from the goodness of God, which properties, great as they
are, I sadly neglected to consider; this I think, should be to me a matter of groaning and of
weeping. I should have inwardly pondered these things, I should have discussed them with
myself, I should have referred them to others, I should have propounded the inquiry, what
the power of knowing is, seeing there is nothing in man that we can compare to this excellency?
And as men, if only they had been men, would have granted me this, I should have
inquired whether seeing with these eyes is knowing? In case they had answered negatively,
I should first have concluded, that mental intelligence is vastly inferior to ocular sensation;
then I should have added, that what we perceive by means of a better thing must needs be
judged to be itself better. Who would not grant this? I should have gone on to inquire,
whether that soul which they call evil is an object of ocular sensation or of mental intelligence?
They would have acknowledged that the latter is the case. All which things having
been agreed upon and confirmed between us, I should have shown how it follows, that that
soul forsooth which they execrate, is better than that light which they venerate, since the
former is an object of mental knowledge, the latter an object of corporeal sense perception.
But here perhaps they would have halted, and would have refused to follow the lead of
reason, so great is the power of inveterate opinion and of falsehood long defended and believed.
But I should have pressed yet more upon them halting, not harshly, not in puerile
fashion, not obstinately; I should have repeated the things that had been conceded, and have
shown how they must be conceded. I should have exhorted that they consult in common,
that they may see clearly what must be denied to us; whether they think it false that intellectual
perception is to be preferred to these carnal organs of sight, or that what is known by
means of the excellency of the mind is more excellent than what is known by vile corporeal
sensation; whether they would be unwilling to confess that those souls which they think
heterogenous, can be known only by intellectual perception, that is, by the excellency itself
of the mind; whether they would wish to deny that the sun and the moon are made known
to us only by means of these eyes. But if they had replied that no one of these things could

<pb n="164"/>
be denied otherwise than most absurdly and most impudently, I should have urged that
they ought not to doubt but that the light whose worthiness of worship they proclaim, is
viler than that soul which they admonish men to flee.</p>

that the soul even of a fly198 surpasses that light, I should have replied, yes, nor should it

it is inquired, what causes those members so diminutive to grow, what leads so minute a
body here and there according to its natural appetite, what moves its feet in numerical order

<head>Chapter 5.—How Vicious Souls, However Worthy of Condemnation They May Be,
Excel the Light Which is Praiseworthy in Its Kind.</head>
<p>Certainly nobody doubts that whatever is an object of intellectual perception, by virtue
of divine laws surpasses in excellence every sensible object and consequently also this light.
For what, I ask, do we perceive by thought, if not that it is one thing to know with the mind,
and another thing to experience bodily sensations, and that the former is incomparably
more sublime than the latter, and so that intelligible things must needs be preferred to
sensible things, since the intellect itself is so highly exalted above the senses?</p>
<p>5. Hence this also I should perchance have known, which manifestly follows, since injustice
and intemperance and other vices of the mind are not objects of sense, but of intellect,
how it comes about that these too which we detest and consider condemnable, yet in as
much as they are objects of intellect, can outrank this light however praiseworthy it may be
in its kind. For it is borne in upon the mind subjecting itself well to God, that, first of all,
not everything that we praise is to be preferred to everything that we find fault with. For in
praising the purest lead, I do not therefore put a higher value upon it than upon the gold
that I find fault with. For everything must be considered in its kind. I disapprove of a lawyer
ignorant of many statutes, yet I so prefer him to the most approved tailor, that I should
think him incomparably superior. But I praise the tailor because he is thoroughly skilled
in his own craft, while I rightly blame the lawyer because he imperfectly fulfills the functions
of his profession. Wherefore I should have found out that the light which in its own kind
is perfect, is rightly to be praised; yet because it is included in the number of sensible things,
which class must needs yield to the class of intelligible things, it must be ranked below unjust
and intemperate souls, since these are intelligible; although we may without injustice judge
these to be most worthy of condemnation. For in the case of these we ask that they be reconciled
to God, not that they be preferred to that lightning. Wherefore, if any one had
contended that this luminary is from God, I should not have opposed; but rather I should
have said, that souls, even vicious ones, not in so far as they are vicious, but in so far as they
are souls, must be acknowledged to be creatures of God.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Whether Even Vices Themselves as Objects of Intellectual Apprehension
are to Be Preferred to Light as an Object of Sense Perception, and are to Be At-
tributed to God as Their Author. Vice of the Mind and Certain Defects are Not
Rightly to Be Counted Among Intelligible Things. Defects Themselves Even If
They Should Be Counted Among Intelligible Things Should Never Be Put Before
Sensible Things. If Light is Visible by God, Much More is the Soul, Even If Vicious,
Which in So Far as It Lives is an Intelligible Thing. Passages of Scripture
are Adduced by the Manichæans to the Contrary.</head>
<p>At this point, in case some one of them, cautious and watchful, now also more studious
than pertinacious, had admonished me that the inquiry is not about vicious souls but about
vices themselves, which, seeing that they are not known by corporeal sense, and yet are
known, can only be received as objects of intellectual apprehension, which if they excel all
objects of sense, why can we not agree in attributing light to God as its author, but only a
sacrilegious person would say that God is the author of vices; I should have replied to the
man, if either on the spur of the moment, as is customary to the worshippers of the good
God, a solution of this question had darted like lightning from on high, or a solution had
been previously prepared. If I had not deserved or was unable to avail myself of either of
these methods, I should have deferred the undertaking, and should have confessed that the
thing propounded was difficult to discern and arduous. I should have withdrawn to myself,
prostrated myself before God, groaned aloud asking Him not to suffer me to halt in mid
space, when I should have moved forward with assured arguments, asking Him that I might
not be compelled by a doubtful question either to subordinate intelligible things to sensible,
and to yield, or to call Himself the author of vices; since either of these alternatives would
have been absolutely full of falsehood and impiety. I can by no means suppose that He
would have deserted me in such a frame of mind. Rather, in His own ineffable way, He
would have admonished me to consider again and again whether vices of mind concerning
which I was so troubled should be reckoned among intelligible things. But that I might find
out, on account of the weakness of my inner eye, which rightly befell me on account of my
sins, I should have devised some sort of stage for gazing upon spiritual things in visible
things themselves, of which we have by no means a surer knowledge, but a more confident
familiarity. Therefore I should straightway have inquired, what properly pertains to the
sensation of the eyes. I should have found that it is the color, the dominion of which the
light holds. For these are the things that no other sense touches, for the motions and magnitudes
and intervals and figures of bodies, although they also can be perceived by the eyes,
yet to perceive such is not their peculiar function, but belongs also to touch. Whence I
should have gathered that by as much as yonder light excels other corporeal and sensible
things, by so much is sight more noble than the other senses. The light therefore having

<pb n="168"/>
been selected from all the things that are perceived by bodily sense, by this [light] I should
have striven, and in this of necessity I should have placed that stage of my inquiry. I should
have gone on to consider what might be done in this way, and thus I should have reasoned
with myself: If yonder sun, conspicuous by its brightness and sufficing for day by its light,
should little by little decline in our sight into the likeness of the moon, would we perceive
anything else with our eyes than light however refulgent, yet seeking light by reason of not
seeing what had been, and using it for seeing what was present? Therefore we should not
see the decline, but the light that should survive the decline. But since we should not see,
we should not perceive; for whatever we perceive by sight must necessarily be seen; wherefore
if that decline were perceived neither by sight nor by any other sense, it cannot be reckoned
among objects of sense. For nothing is an object of sense that cannot be perceived by sense.
Let us apply now the consideration to virtue, by whose intellectual light we most fittingly
say the mind shines. Again, a certain decline from this light of virtue, not destroying the
soul, but obscuring it, is called vice. Therefore also vice can by no means be reckoned among
objects of intellectual perception, as that decline of light is rightly excluded from the number
of objects of sense perception. Yet what remains of soul, that is that which lives and is soul
is just as much an object of intellectual perception as that is an object of sense perception
which should shine in this visible luminary after any imaginable degree of decline. And so
the soul, in so far as it is soul and partakes of life, without which it can in no way be soul, is
most correctly to be preferred to all objects of sense perception. Wherefore it is most erroneous
to say that any soul is not from God, from whom you boast that the sun and moon
have their existence.</p>
<p>7. But if now it should be thought fit to designate as objects of sense perception not
only all those things that we perceive by the senses, but also all those things that though not
perceiving by the senses we judge of by means of the body, as of darkness through the eyes,
of silence through the ears,—for not by seeing darkness and not by hearing silence do we
know of their existence,—and again, in the case of objects of intellectual perception, not
those things only which we see illuminated by the mind, as is wisdom itself, but also those
things which by the illumination itself we avoid, such as foolishness, which I might fittingly
designate mental darkness; I should have made no controversy about a word, but should
have dissolved the whole question by an easy division, and straightway I should have proved
to those giving good attention, that by the divine law of truth intelligible subsistences are
to be preferred to sensible subsistences, not the decline of these subsistences, even though
we should choose to call these intelligible, those sensible. Wherefore, that those who acknowledge
that these visible luminaries and those intelligible souls are subsistences, are in
every way compelled to grant and to attribute the sublimer part to souls; but that defects of
either kind cannot be preferred the one to the other, for they are only privative and indicate
nonexistence, and therefore have precisely the same force as negations themselves. For

<pb n="169"/>
when we say, It is not gold, and, It is not virtue, although there is the greatest possible difference
between gold and virtue, yet there is no difference between the negations that we adjoin
to them. But that it is worse indeed not to be virtue than not to be gold, no sane man doubts.
Who does not know that the difference lies not in the negations themselves, but in the things
to which they are adjoined? For by as much as virtue is more excellent than gold, by so
much is it more wretched to be in want of virtue than of gold. Wherefore, since intelligible
things excel sensible things, we rightly feel greater repugnance towards defect in intelligible
than in sensible things, esteeming not the defects, but the things that are deficient more or
less precious. From which now it appears, that defect of light, which is intelligible, is far
more wretched than defect of the sensible light, because, forsooth, life which is known is by
far more precious than yonder light which is seen.</p>
<p>8. This being the case, who will dare, while attributing sun and moon, and whatever is
refulgent in the stars, nay in this fire of ours and in this visible earthly life, to God, to decline
to grant that any souls whatsoever, which are not souls except by the fact of their being
perfectly alive, since in this fact alone life has the precedence of light, are from God. And
since he speaks truth who says, In as far as a thing shines it is from God, would I speak
falsely, mighty God, if I should say, In so far as a thing lives it is from God? Let not, I beseech
thee, blindness of intellect and perversions of mind be increased to such an extent that men
may fail to know these things. But however great their error and pertinacity might have
been, trusting in these arguments and armed therewith, I believe that when I should have
laid the matter before them thus considered and canvassed, and should have calmly conferred
with them, I should have feared lest any one of them should have seemed to me to be of any
consequence, should he endeavor to subordinate or even to compare to bodily sense, or to
those things that pertain to bodily sense as objects of knowledge, either intellect or those
things that are perceived (not by way of defect) by the intellect. Which point having been
settled, how would he or any other have dared to deny that such souls as he would consider
evil, yet since they are souls, are to be reckoned in the number of intelligible things, nor are
objects of intellectual perception by way of defect? This is on the supposition that souls are
souls only by being alive. For if they were intellectually perceived as vicious through defect,
being vicious by lack of virtue, yet they are perceived as souls not through defect, for they
are souls by reason of being alive. Nor can it be maintained that presence of life is a cause
of defect, for by as much as anything is defective, by so much is it severed from life.</p>
<p>9. Since therefore it would have been every way evident that no souls can be separated
from that Author from whom yonder light is not separated, whatever they might have now
adduced I should not have accepted, and should rather have admonished them that they
should choose with me to follow those who maintain that whatever is, since it is, and in
whatever degree it is, has its existence from the one God.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—How Evil Men are of God, and Not of God.</head>
<p>They might have cited against me those words of the gospel: "Ye therefore do not hear,
because ye are not of God;" "Ye are of your father the devil."199 I also should have cited:
"All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made,"200 and this of the
Apostle: "One God of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are
all things,"201 and again from the same Apostle: "Of whom are all things, through whom
are all things, in whom are all things, to Him be glory."202 I should have exhorted those
men (if indeed I had found them men), that we should presume upon nothing as if we had
found it out, but should rather inquire of the masters who would demonstrate the agreement
and harmony of those passages that seem to be discordant. For when in one and the same
Scriptural authority we read: "All things are of God,"203 and elsewhere: "Ye are not of God,"
since it is wrong rashly to condemn books of Scripture, who would not have seen that a
skilled teacher should be found who would know a solution of this problem, from whom
assuredly if endowed with good intellectual powers, and a "spiritual man," as is said by divine
inspiration204 (for he would necessarily have favored the true arguments concerning the
intelligible and sensible nature, which, as far as I can, I have conducted and handled, nay
he would have disclosed them far better and more convincingly); we should have heard
nothing else concerning this problem, except, as might happen, that there is no class of souls
but has its existence from God, and that it is yet rightly said to sinners and unbelievers: "Ye
are not of God." For we also, perchance, Divine aid having been implored, should have
been able easily to see, that it is one thing to live and another to sin, and (although life in
sin may be called death in comparison with just life,205 and while in one man it may be
found, that he is at the same time alive and a sinner) that so far as he is alive, he is of God,
so far as he is a sinner he is not of God. In which division we use that alternative that suits
our sentiment; so that when we wish to insist upon the omnipotence of God as Creator, we
may say even to sinners that they are of God. For we are speaking to those who are contained
in some class, we are speaking to those having animal life, we are speaking to rational beings,
we are speaking lastly—and this applies especially to the matter in hand—to living beings,
all which things are essentially divine functions. But when our purpose is to convict evil
men, we rightly say: "Ye are not of God." For we speak to them as averse to truth, unbeliev-

ing, criminal, infamous, and, to sum up all in one term—sinners, all of which things are
undoubtedly not of God. Therefore what wonder is it, if Christ says to sinners, convicting
them of this very thing that they were sinners and did not believe in Him: "Ye are not of
God;" and on the other hand, without prejudice to the former statement: "All things were
made through Him," and "All things are of God?" For if not to believe Christ, to repudiate
Christ’s advent, not to accept Christ, was a sure mark of souls that are not of God; and so
it was said: "Ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of God;" how would that saying of
the apostle be true that occurs in the memorable beginning of the gospel: "He came unto
his own things, and his own people did not receive him?"206 Whence his own if they did
not receive him; or whence therefore not his own because they did not receive him, unless
that sinners by virtue of being men belong to God, but by virtue of being sinners belong to
the devil? He who says: "His own people received him not" had reference to nature; but he
who says: "Ye are not of God." had reference to will; for the evangelist was commending
the works of God, Christ was censuring the sins of men.</p>

They Have Triumphed. Let Them First Know, Which is Most Easy to Do, that
Nothing Can Live Without God. Consummate Evil Cannot Be Known Except
by the Knowledge of Consummate Good, Which is God.</head>
<p>Here perchance some one may say: Whence are sins themselves, and whence is evil in
general? If from man, whence is man? if from an angel, whence is the angel? When it is
said, however truly and rightly, that these are from God, it nevertheless seems to those unskillful
and possessed of little power to look into recondite matters, that evils and sins are
thereby connected, as by a sort of chain, to God. By this question they think themselves
triumphant, as if forsooth to ask were to know;—would it were so, for in that case no one
would be more knowing than myself. Yet very often in controversy the propounder of a
great question, while impersonating the great teacher, is himself more ignorant in the matter
concerning which he would frighten his opponent, than he whom he would frighten.</p>
<p>These therefore suppose that they are superior to the common run, because the former
ask questions that the latter cannot answer. If therefore when I most unfortunately was associated
with them, not in the position in which I have now for some time been, they had
raised these objections when I had brought forward this argument, I should have said: I
ask that you meanwhile agree with me, which is most easy, that if nothing can shine without
God, much less can anything live without God. Let us not persist in such monstrous opinions
as to maintain that any souls whatsoever have life apart from God. For perchance it may
so happen that with me you are ignorant as to this thing, namely whence is evil, let us then
learn either simultaneously or in any order, I care not what. For what if knowledge of the
perfection of evil is impossible to man without knowledge of the perfection of good? For
we should not know darkness if we were always in darkness. But the notion of light does
not allow its opposite to be unknown. But the highest good is that than which there is
nothing higher. But God is good and than Him nothing can be higher. God therefore is
the highest good. Let us therefore together so recognize God, and thus what we seek too
hastily will not be hidden from us. Do you suppose then that the knowledge of God is a
matter of small account or desert. For what other reward is there for us than life eternal,
which is to know God? For God the Master says: "But this is life eternal, that they might
know Thee the only and true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent."207 For the soul,
although it is immortal, yet because aversion from the knowledge of God is rightly called
its death, when it is converted to God, the reward of eternal life to be attained is that
knowledge; so that this is, as has been said, eternal life. But no one can be converted to God,
except he turn himself away from this world. This for myself I feel to be arduous and exceedingly
difficult, whether it is easy to you, God Himself would have seen. I should have
<note type="footnote">207 John xvii. 3.</note>

<pb n="173"/>
been inclined to think it easy to you, had I not been moved by the fact, that, since the world
from which we are commanded to turn away is visible, and the apostle says: "The things
that are seen are temporal, but the things that are unseen are eternal,"208 you ascribe more
importance to the judgment of these eyes than to that of the mind, asserting and believing
as you do that there is no shining feather that does not shine from God; and that there are
living souls that do not live from God. These and like things I should either have said to
them or considered with myself, for even then, supplicating God with all my bowels, so to
speak, and examining as attentively as possible the Scriptures, I should perchance have been
able either to say such things or to think them, so far as was necessary for my salvation.</p>

<p>But two things especially, which easily lay hold upon that unwary age, urged me through
wonderful circuits. One of these was familiarity, suddenly, by a certain false semblance of
goodness, wrapped many times around my neck as a certain sinuous chain. The other was,
that I was almost always noxiously victorious in arguing with ignorant Christians who yet
eagerly attempted, each as he could, to defend their faith.209 By which frequent success the
ardor of youth was kindled, and by its own impulse rashly verged upon the great evil of
stubbornness. For this kind of wrangling, after I had become an auditor among them,
whatever I was able to do either by my own genius, such as it was, or by reading the works
of others, I most gladly devoted to them alone. Accordingly from their speeches ardor in
disputations was daily increased, from success in disputations love for them <del>the
Manichæans</del>. Whence it resulted that whatever they said, as if affected by certain strange
disorders, I approved of as true, not because I knew it to be true, but because I wished it to

that preferred a sleek straw to a living soul.</p>

things, carnal forsooth from spiritual. It did not belong to age, nor to discipline, nor even
to any habit, nor, finally, to any deserts; for it is a matter of no small joy and felicitation:

<head>Chapter 10.—Sin is Only from the Will. His Own Life and Will Best Known to Each
Individual. What Will is.</head>
<p>For let any men whatever, if only no madness has broken them loose from the common
sense of the human race, bring whatever zeal they like for judging, whatever ignorance, nay
whatever slowness of mind, I should like to find out what they would have replied to me
had I asked, whether a man would seem to them to have sinned by whose hand while he
was asleep another should have written something disgraceful? Who doubts that they would
have denied that it is a sin, and have exclaimed against it so vehemently that they might
perchance have been enraged that I should have thought them proper objects of such a
question? Of whom reconciled and restored to equanimity, as best I could do it, I should
have begged that they would not take it amiss if I asked them another thing just as manifest,
just as completely within the knowledge of all. Then I should have asked, if some stronger
person had done some evil thing by the hand of one not sleeping but conscious, yet with
the rest of his members bound and in constraint, whether because he knew it, though absolutely
unwilling, he should be held guilty of any sin? And here all marvelling that I should
ask such questions, would reply without hesitation, that he had absolutely not sinned at all.
Why so? Because whoever has done anything evil by means of one unconscious or unable
to resist, the latter can by no means be justly condemned. And precisely why this is so, if I
should inquire of the human nature in these men, I should easily bring out the desired answer,
by asking in this manner: Suppose that the sleeper already knew what the other would do
with his hand, and of purpose aforethought, having drunk so much as would prevent his
being awakened, should go to sleep, in order to deceive some one with an oath. Would any
amount of sleep suffice to prove his innocence? What else than a guilty man would one
pronounce him? But if he has also willingly been bound that he may deceive some one by
this pretext, in what respect then would those chains profit as a means of relieving him of
sin? Although bound by these he was really not able to resist, as in the other case the
sleeper was absolutely ignorant of what he was then doing. Is there therefore any possibility
of doubting that both should be judged to have sinned? Which things having been conceded,
I should have argued, that sin is indeed nowhere but in the will,210 since this consideration
<note type="footnote">210 The Pelagians used this statement with considerable effect in their polemics against its author. In his
Retractations Augustin has this to say by way of explanation: "The Pelagians may think that thus was said in
their interest, on account of young children whose sin which is remitted to them in baptism they deny on the
ground that they do not yet use the power of will. As if indeed the sin, which we say they derive originally from
Adam, that is, that they are implicated in his guilt and on this account are held obnoxious to punishment, could
ever be otherwise than in will, by which will it was committed when the transgression of the divine precept was
accomplished. Our statement, that ‘there is never sin but in will,’ may be thought false for the reason that the
apostle says: ‘If what I will not this I do, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.’ For this sin is</note>

<pb n="176"/>
also would have helped me, that justice holds guilty those sinning by evil will alone, although
they may have been unable to accomplish what they willed.</p>
<p>13. For who could have said that, in adducing these considerations, I was dwelling upon
obscure and recondite things, where on account of the fewness of those able to understand,
either fraud or suspicion of ostentation is accustomed to arise? Let that distinction between
intelligible and sensible things withdraw for a little: let me not be found fault with for following
up slow minds with the stimuli of subtle disputations. Permit me to know that I
live, permit me to know that I will to live. If in this the human race agrees, as our life is
known to us, so also is our will. Nor when we become possessed of this knowledge, is there
any occasion to fear lest any one should convince us that we may be deceived; for no one
can be deceived as to whether he does not live, or wishes nothing. I do not think that I have
adduced anything obscure, and my concern is rather lest some should find fault with me
for dwelling on things that are too manifest. But let us consider the bearing of these things.</p>
<p>14. Sinning therefore takes place only by exercise of will. But our will is very well known
to us; for neither should I know that I will, if I did not know what will itself is. Accordingly,
<note type="footnote">to such an extent involuntary, that he says: ‘What I will not this I do.’ How, therefore, is there never sin but in
the will? But this sin concerning which the apostle has spoken is called sin, because by sin it was done, and it
is the penalty of sin; since this is said concerning carnal concupiscence, which he discloses in what follows saying:
‘I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth no good; for to will is present to me, but to accomplish that
which is good, is not.’ (Rom. vii. 16-18). Since the perfection of good is, that not even the concupiscence of sin
should be in man, to which indeed when one lives well the will does not consent; nevertheless man does not
accomplish the good because as yet concupiscence is in him, to which the will is antagonistic, the guilt of which
concupiscence is loosed by baptism, but the infirmity remains, against which until it is healed every believer
who advances well most earnestly struggles. But sin, which is never but in will, must especially be known as
that which is followed by just condemnation. For this through one man entered into the world; although that
sin also by which consent is yielded to concupiscence is not committed but by will. Wherefore also in another
place I have said: ‘Not therefore except by will is sin committed.’"—A.H.N. On this matter Augustin’s still
earlier treatise De Libero Arbitrio, and his interesting Retractations on the same, should be compared. The
reader of these earlier treatises in comparison with the Anti-Pelagian treatises can hardly fail to recognize a
marked change of base on Augustin’s part. His efforts to show the consistency of his earlier with his later modes
of thought are to be pronounced only partially successful. The fact is, that in the Anti-Manichæan time he went
too far in maintaining the absolute freedom of the will and the impossibility of sin apart from personal will in
the sinner; while in the Anti-Pelagian time he ventured too near to the fatalism that he so earnestly combated
in the Manichæans.—A.H.N.</note>

it is thus defined: will is a movement of mind, no one compelling, either for not losing or
for obtaining something.211 Why therefore could not I have so defined it then? Was it
difficult to see that one unwilling is contrary to one willing, just as the left hand is contrary
to the right, not as black to white? For the same thing cannot be at the same time black and
white. But whoever is placed between two men is on the left hand with reference to one,
on the right with reference to the other. One man is both on the right hand and on the left
hand at the same time, but by no means both to the one man. So indeed one mind may be
at the same time unwilling and willing, but it cannot be at the same time unwilling and
willing with reference to one and the same thing. For when any one unwillingly does anything;
if you ask him whether he wished to do it, he says that he did not. Likewise if you
ask whether he wished not to do it, he replies that he did. So you will find him unwilling
with reference to doing, willing with reference to not doing, that is to say, one mind at the
same time having both attitudes, but each referring to different things. Why do I say this?
Because if we should again ask wherefore though unwilling he does this, he will say that he
is compelled. For every one also who does a thing unwillingly is compelled, and every one
who is compelled, if he does a thing, does it only unwillingly. It follows that he that is willing
is free from compulsion, even if any one thinks himself compelled. And in this manner
every one who willingly does a thing is not compelled, and whoever is not compelled, either
does it willingly or not at all. Since nature itself proclaims these things in all men whom we
can interrogate without absurdity, from the boy even to the old man, from literary sport
even to the throne of the wise, why then should I not have seen that in the definition of will
<note type="footnote">211 This dictum also Augustin thought it needful to explain: "This was said that by this definition a willing
person might be distinguished from one not willing, and so the intention might be referred to those who first
in Paradise were the origin of evil to the human race, by sinning no one compelling, that is by sinning with free
will, because also knowingly they sinned against the command, and the tempters persuaded, did not compel,
that this should be done. For he who ignorantly sinned may not incongruously be said to have sinned unwillingly,
although not knowing what he did, yet willingly he did it. So not even the sin of such a one could be without
will, which will assuredly, as it has been defined, was a ‘movement of the mind, no one compelling, either for
not losing or for obtaining something.’ For he was not compelled to do what if he had been unwilling he would
not have done. Because he willed, therefore he did it, even if he did not sin because he willed, being ignorant
that what he did is sin. So not even such a sin could be without will, but by will of deed not by will of sin, which
deed was yet sin; for this deed is what ought not to have taken place. But whoever knowingly sins, if he can
without sin resist the one compelling him to sin, yet resists not, assuredly sins willingly. For he who can resist
is not compelled to yield. But he who cannot by good will resist cogent covetousness, and therefore does what
is contrary to the precepts of righteousness, this now is sin in the sense of being the penalty of sin. Wherefore
it is most true that sin cannot be apart from will." It is needless to say that such reasoning would not have
answered Augustin’s purpose in writing against the Manichæans.—A.H.N.</note>

should be put, "no one compelling," which now as if with greater experience most cautiously
I have done. But if this is everywhere manifest, and promptly occurs to all not by instruction
but by nature, what is there left that seems obscure, unless perchance it be concealed from
some one, that when we wish for something, we will, and our mind is moved towards it,
and we either have it or do not have it, and if we have it we will to retain it, if we have it not,
to acquire it? Wherefore everyone who wills, wills either not to lose something or to obtain
it. Hence if all these things are clearer than day, as they are, nor are they given to my conception
alone, but by the liberality of truth itself to the whole human race, why could I not
have said even at that time: Will is a movement of the mind, no one compelling, either for
not losing or for obtaining something?</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—What Sin is.</head>
<p>Some one will say: What assistance would this have furnished you against the
Manichæans? Wait a moment; permit me first also to define sin, which, every mind reads
divinely written in itself, cannot exist apart from will. Sin therefore is the will to retain and
follow after what justice forbids, and from which it is free to abstain.212 Although if it be
not free, it is not will. But I have preferred to define more roughly than precisely. Should
I not also have carefully examined those obscure books, whence I might have learned that
no one is worthy of blame or punishment who either wills what justice does not prohibit
him from willing, or does not do what he is not able to do? Do not shepherds on mountains,
poets in theatres, unlearned in social intercourse, learned in libraries, masters in schools,
priests in consecrated places, and the human race throughout the whole world, sing out
these things? But if no one is worthy of blame and condemnation, who either does not act
against the prohibition of justice, or who does not do what he cannot do, yet every sin is
blameworthy and condemnable, who doubts then that it is sin, when willing is unjust, and
not willing is free. And hence that definition is both true and easy to understand, and not
only now but then also could have been spoken by me: Sin is the will of retaining or of obtaining,
what justice forbids, and whence it is free to abstain?</p>
<note type="footnote">212 Here also Augustin guards himself in his Retractations: "The definition is true, inasmuch as that is
defined which is only sin, and not also that which is the penalty of sin."—A.H.N.</note>

<head>Chapter 12.—From the Definitions Given of Sin and Will, He Overthrows the Entire
Heresy of the Manichæans. Likewise from the Just Condemnation of Evil Souls
It Follows that They are Evil Not by Nature But by Will. That Souls are Good
By Nature, to Which the Pardon of Sins is Granted.</head>
<p>16. Come now, let us see in what respect these things would have aided us. Much every
way, so that I should have desired nothing more; for they end the whole cause; for whoever
consulting in the inner mind, where they are more pronounced and assured, the secrets of
his own conscience, and the divine laws absolutely imposed upon nature, grants that these
two definitions of will and sin are true, condemns without any hesitation by the fewest and
the briefest, but plainly the most invincible reasons, the whole heresy of the Manichæans.
Which can be thus considered. They say that there are two kinds of souls, the one good,
which is in such a way from God, that it is said not to have been made by Him out of any
material or out of nothing, but to have proceeded as a certain part from the very substance
itself of God; the other evil, which they believe and strive to get others to believe pertains
to God in no way whatever; and so they maintain that the one is the perfection of good, but
the other the perfection of evil, and that these two classes were at one time distinct but are
now commingled. The character and the cause of this commingling I had not yet heard;
but nevertheless I could have inquired whether that evil kind of souls, before it was mingled
with the good, had any will. For if not, it was without sin and innocent, and so by no means
evil.213 But if evil in such a way, that though without will, as fire, yet if it should touch the
good it would violate and corrupt it; how impious it is to believe that the nature of evil is
powerful enough to change any part of God, and that the Highest Good is corruptible and
violable! But if the will was present, assuredly there was present, no one compelling, a
movement of the mind either towards not losing something or obtaining something. But
this something was either good, or was thought to be good, for not otherwise could it be
earnestly desired. But in supreme evil, before the commingling which they maintain, there
never was any good. Whence then could there be in it either the knowledge or the thought
of good? Did they wish for nothing that was in themselves, and earnestly desire that true
good which was without? That will must truly be declared worthy of distinguished and
great praise by which is earnestly desired the supreme and true good. Whence then in supreme
evil was this movement of mind most worthy of so great praise? Did they seek it for
the sake of injuring it? In the first place, the argument comes to the same thing. For he
who wishes to injure, wishes to deprive another of some good for the sake of some good of
<note type="footnote">213 In his Retractations, Augustin replies to the Pelagian denial of the sinfulness of infants, in support of
which they had quoted the above sentence. "They [infants] are held guilty not by propriety of will but by origin.
For what is every earthly man in origin but Adam?" The will of the whole human race was in Adam, and when
Adam sinned the whole race voluntarily sinned, seems to be his meaning.—A.H.N.</note>

<pb n="181"/>
his own. There was therefore in them either a knowledge of good or an opinion of good,
which ought by no means to belong to supreme evil. In the second place, whence had they
known, that good placed outside of themselves, which they designed to injure, existed at
all. If they had intellectually perceived it, what is more excellent than such a mind? Is there
anything else for which the whole energy of good men is put forth except the knowledge of
that supreme and sincere good? What therefore is now scarcely conceded to a few good
and just men, was mere evil, no good assisting, then able to accomplish? But if those souls
bore bodies and saw the supreme good with their eyes, what tongues, what hearts, what intellects
suffice for lauding and proclaiming those eyes, with which the minds of just men
can scarcely be compared? How great good things we find in supreme evil! For if to see
God is evil, God is not a good; but God is a good; therefore to see God is good; and I know
not what can be compared to this good. Since to see anything is good, whence can it be
made out that to be able to see is evil? Therefore whatever in those eyes or in those minds
brought it about, that the divine essence could be seen by them, brought about a great thing
and a good thing most worthy of ineffable praise. But if it was not brought about, but it was
such in itself and eternal, it is difficult to find anything better than this evil.</p>
<p>17. Lastly, that these souls may have nothing of these praiseworthy things which by the
reasonings of the Manichæans they are compelled to have, I should have asked, whether
God condemns any or no souls. If none, there is no judgment of rewards and punishments,
no providence, and the world is administered by chance rather than by reason, or rather is
not administered at all. For the name administration must not be given to chances. But if
it is impious for all those that are bound by any religion to believe this, it remains either
that there is condemnation of some souls, or that there are no sins. But if there are no sins,
neither is there any evil. Which if the Manichæans should say, they would slay their heresy
with a single blow. Therefore they and I agree that some souls are condemned by divine
law and judgment. But if these souls are good, what is that justice? If evil, are they so by
nature, or by will? But by nature souls can in no way be evil. Whence do we teach this.
From the above definitions of will and sin. For to speak of souls, and that they are evil, and
that they do not sin, is full of madness; but to say that they sin without will, is great craziness,
and to hold any one guilty of sin for not doing what he could not do, belongs to the height
of iniquity and insanity. Wherefore whatever these souls do, if they do it by nature not by
will, that is, if they are wanting in a movement of mind free both for doing and not doing,
if finally no power of abstaining from their work is conceded to them; we cannot hold that
the sin is theirs.214 But all confess both that evil souls are justly, and souls that have not
<note type="footnote">214 In his Retractations, Augustin explains that by nature is to be understood the state in which we were
created without vice. He transfers the entire argument from the actual condition of man to the primitive Adamic
condition. It is evident, however, that this was not his meaning when he combated the Manichæans. The
question of infant sinfulness arises here also, and is discussed in the usual Anti-Pelagian way.—A.H.N.</note>

<pb n="182"/>
sinned are unjustly condemned; therefore they confess that those souls are evil that sin. But
these, as reason teaches, do not sin. Therefore the extraneous class of evil souls of the
Manichæans, whatever it may be, is a non-entity.</p>
<p>18. Let us now look at that good class of souls, which again they exalt to such a degree
as to say that it is the very substance of God. But how much better it is that each one should
recognize his own rank and merit, nor be so puffed up with sacrilegious pride as to believe
that as often as he experiences a change in himself it is the substance of that supreme good,
which devout reason holds and teaches to be unchangeable! For behold! since it is manifest
that souls do not sin in not being such as they cannot be; it follows that these supposititious
souls, whatever they may be, do not sin at all, and moreover that they are absolutely nonexistent;
it remains that since there are sins, they find none to whom to attribute them except
the good class of souls and the substance of God. But especially are they pressed by Christian
authority; for never have they denied that forgiveness of sins is granted when any one has
been converted to God; never have they said (as they have said of many other passages) that
some corrupter has interpolated this into the divine Scriptures. To whom then are sins attributed?
If to those evil souls of the alien class, these also can become good, can possess
the kingdom of God with Christ. Which denying, they <del>the Manichæans</del> have no other
class except those souls which they maintain are of the substance of God. It remains that
they acknowledge that not only these latter also, but these alone sin. But I make no contention
about their being alone in sinning; yet they sin. But are they compelled to sin by being
commingled with evil? If so compelled that there was no power of resisting, they do not
sin. If it is in their power to resist, and they voluntarily consent, we are compelled to find
out through their <del>the Manichæan</del> teaching, why so great good things in supreme evil, why
this evil in supreme good, unless it be that neither is that which they bring into suspicion
evil, nor is that which they pervert by superstition supreme good?</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—From Deliberation on the Evil and on the Good Part It Results that
Two Classes of Souls are Not to Be Held to. A Class of Souls Enticing to
Shameful Deeds Having Been Conceded, It Does Not Follow that These are Evil
by Nature, that the Others are Supreme Good.</head>
<p>19. But if I had taught, or at any rate had myself learned, that they rave and err regarding
those two classes of souls, why should I have thenceforth thought them worthy of being
heard or consulted about anything? That I might learn hence, that these two kinds of souls
are pointed out, which in the course of deliberation assent puts now on the evil side, now
on the good? Why is not this rather the sign of one soul which by free will can be borne
here and there, swayed hither and thither? For it was my own experience to feel that I am
one, considering evil and good and choosing one or the other, but for the most part the one
pleases, the other is fitting, placed in the midst of which we fluctuate. Nor is it to be wondered
at, for we are now so constituted that through the flesh we can be affected by sensual pleasure,
and through the spirit by honorable considerations. Am I not therefore compelled to acknowledge
two souls? Nay, we can better and with far less difficulty recognize two classes
of good things, of which neither is alien from God as its author, one soul acted upon from
diverse directions, the lower and the higher, or to speak more correctly, the external and
the internal. These are the two classes which a little while ago we considered under the
names sensible and intelligible, which we now prefer to call more familiarly carnal and
spiritual. But it has been made difficult for us to abstain from carnal things, since our truest
bread is spiritual. For with great labor we now eat this bread. For neither without punishment
for the sin of transgression have we been changed from immortal into mortal. So it
happens, that when we strive after better things, habit formed by connection with the flesh
and our sins in some way begin to militate against us and to put obstacles in our way, some
foolish persons with most obtuse superstition suspect that there is another kind of souls
which is not of God.</p>
<p>20. However even if it be conceded to them that we are enticed to shameful deeds by
another inferior kind of souls, they do not thence make it evident that those enticing are
evil by nature, or those enticed, supremely good. For it may be, the former of their own
will, by striving after what was not lawful, that is, by sinning, from being good have become
evil; and again they may be made good, but in such manner that for a long time they remain
in sin, and by a certain occult suasion traduce to themselves other souls. Then, they may
not be absolutely evil, but in their own kind, however inferior, they may exercise their own
functions without any sin. But those superior souls to whom justice, the directress of things,
has assigned a far more excellent activity, if they should wish to follow and to imitate those
inferior ones, become evil, not because they imitate evil souls, but because they imitate in
an evil way. By the evil souls is done what is proper to them, by the good what is alien to

<pb n="184"/>
them is striven after. Hence the former remain in their own grade, the latter are plunged
into a lower. It is as when men copy after beasts. For the four-footed horse walks beautifully,
but if a man on all fours should imitate him, who would think him worthy even of chaff for
food? Rightly therefore we generally disapprove of one who imitates, while we approve of
him whom he imitates. But we disapprove not because he has not succeeded, but for wishing
to succeed at all. For in the horse we approve of that to which by as much as we prefer man,
by so much are we offended that he copies after inferior creatures. So among men, however
well the crier may do in sending forth his voice, would not the senator be insane, if he should
do it even more clearly and better than the crier? Take an illustration from the heavenly
bodies: The moon when shining is praised, and by its course and its changes is quite
pleasing to those that pay attention to such things. But if the sun should wish to imitate it
(for we may feign that it has desires of this sort215), who would not be greatly and rightly
displeased. From which illustrations I wish it to be understood, that even if there are souls
(which meanwhile is left an open question216) devoted to bodily offices not by sin but by
nature, and even if they are related to us, however inferior they may be, by some inner affinity,
they should not be esteemed evil simply because we are evil ourselves in following them and
in loving corporeal things. For we sin by loving corporeal things, because by justice we are
required and by nature we are able to love spiritual things, and when we do this we are, in
our kind, the best and the happiest. 217</p>
<p>21. Wherefore what proof does deliberation, violently urged in both directions, now
prone to sin, now borne on toward right conduct, furnish, that we are compelled to accept
two kinds of souls, the nature of one of which is from God, of the other not; when we are
free to conjecture so many other causes of alternating states of mind? But that these things
are obscure and are to no purpose pried into by blear-eyed minds, whoever is a good judge
of things sees. Wherefore those things rather which have been said regarding the will and
sin, those things, I say, that supreme justice permits no man using his reason to be ignorant
of, those things which if they were taken from us, there is nothing whence the discipline of
virtue may begin, nothing whence it may rise from the death of vices, those things I say
<note type="footnote">215 Augustin’s carefulness to explain that he is only indulging in personification is doubtless due to the fact
that with the Manichæans the sun and the moon were objects of worship.—A.H.N.</note>

of it as such only so far as this particular discussion is concerned. He simply declines to enter upon a consideration
of it in this connection.—A.H.N.</note>

<head>Chapter 14.—Again It is Shown from the Utility of Repenting that Souls are Not by
Nature Evil. So Sure a Demonstration is Not Contradicted Except from the
Habit of Erring.</head>
<p>22. Like the foregoing considerations is what I shall now say about repenting. For as
among all sane people it is agreed, and this the Manichæans themselves not only confess
but also teach, that to repent of sin is useful. Why shall I now, in this matter, collect the
testimonies of the divine Scriptures, which are scattered throughout their pages? It is also
the voice of nature; notice of this thing has escaped no fool. We should be undone, if this
were not deeply imbedded in our nature. Some one may say that he does not sin; but no
barbarity will dare to say, that if one sins he should not repent of it. This being the case, I
ask to which of the two kinds of souls does repenting pertain? I know indeed that it can
pertain neither to him who does ill nor to him who cannot do well. Wherefore, that I may
use the words of the Manichæans, if a soul of darkness repent of sin, it is not of the substance
of supreme evil, if a soul of light, it is not of the substance of supreme good; that disposition
of repenting which is profitable testifies alike that the penitent has done ill, and that he could
have done well. How, therefore, is there from me nothing of evil, if I have acted unadvisedly,
or how can I rightly repent if I have not so done? Hear the other part. How is there from
me nothing of good, if in me there is good will, or how do I rightly repent if there is not?
Wherefore, either let them deny that there is great utility in repenting, so that they may be
driven not only from the Christian name, but from every even imaginary argument for their
views, or let them cease to say and to teach that there are two kinds of souls, one of which
has nothing of evil, the other nothing of good; for that whole sect is propped up by this twoheaded218
or rather headlong219 variety of souls.</p>
<p>23. And to me indeed it is sufficient thus to know that the Manichæans err, that I know
that sin must be repented of; and yet if now by right of friendship I should accost some one
of my friends who still thinks that they are worthy of being listened to, and should say to
him: Do you not know that it is useful, when any one has sinned, to repent? Without hesitation
he will swear that he knows. If then I shall have convinced you that Manichæism is
false, will you not desire anything more? Let him reply what more he can desire in this
matter. Very well, so far. But when I shall have begun to show the sure and necessary arguments
which, bound to it with adamantine chains, as the saying is, follow that proposition,
and shall have conducted to its conclusion the whole process by which that sect is overthrown,
he will deny perhaps that he knows the utility of repenting, which no learned man, no unlearned,
is ignorant of, and will rather contend, when we hesitate and deliberate, that two
souls in us furnish each its own proper help to the solution of the different parts of the

question. O habit of sin! O accompanying penalty of sin! Then you turned me away from

<head>Disputation of the First Day.</head>
<p>On the fifth of September, the most renowned men Arcadius Augustus (the second time) and
Rufinus being consuls, a disputation against Fortunatus, an elder of the Manichæans,
was held in the city of Hippo Regius, in the baths of Sossius, in the presence of the people.</p>
<p>1. Augustin said: I now regard as error what formerly I regarded as truth. I desire to
hear from you who are present whether my supposition is correct. First of all I regard it as
the height of error to believe that Almighty God, in whom is our one hope, is in any part
either violable, or contaminable, or corruptible. This I know your heresy affirms, not indeed
in the words that I now use; for when you are questioned you confess that God is incorruptible,
and absolutely inviolable, and incontaminable; but when you begin to expound the
rest of your system, we are compelled to declare Him corruptible, penetrable, contaminable.
For you say that another race of darkness, whatever it may be, has rebelled against the
kingdom of God; but that Almighty God, when He saw what ruin and desolation threatened

<note type="footnote">221 This Disputation seems to have occurred shortly after the writing of the preceding treatise. It appears
from the Retractations that Fortunatus had lived for a considerable time at Hippo, and had secured so large a
number of followers that it was a delight to him to dwell there. The Disputation is supposed to be a verbatim
report of what Augustin and Fortunatus said during a two days’ discussion. The subject is the origin of evil.
Augustin maintains that evil, so far as man is concerned, has arisen from a free exercise of the will on man’s
part; Fortunatus, on the other hand, maintains that the nature of evil is co-eternal with God. Fortunatus shows
considerable knowledge of the New Testament, but no remarkable dialectic powers. He appears at great disadvantage
beside his great antagonist. In fact, he is far from saying the best that can be said in favor of dualism.
We may say that he was fairly vanquished in the argument, and at the close confessed himself at a loss what to
say, and expressed an intention of more carefully examining the problems discussed, in view of what Augustin
had said. Augustin is more guarded in this treatise than in the preceding in his statements about free will. He
found little occasion here, therefore, to retract or explain. Fortunatus often expresses himself vaguely and obscurely.

framed. Hence it is that here good souls labor, serve, err, are corrupted: that they may see
the need of a liberator, who should purge them from error, loose them from this commingling
with evil, and liberate them from servitude. I think it impious to believe that Almighty God
ever feared any adverse race, or was under necessity to precipitate us into afflictions.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Because I know that you have been in our midst, that is, have lived as
an adherent among the Manichæans, these are the principles of our faith. The matter now
to be considered is our mode of living, the falsely alleged crimes for which we are maltreated.
Therefore let the good men present hear from you whether these things with which we are
charged and which we have thrown in our teeth are true or false. For from your instruction,
and from your exposition and explanation, they will have been able to gain more correct
information about our mode of life, if it shall have been set forth by you.</p>
<p>2. Augustin said: I was among you, but faith and morals are different questions. I
proposed to discuss faith. But if those present prefer to hear about morals, I do not decline
that question.
Fortunatus said: I wish first to purge myself in your conscience in which we are polluted,
by the testimony of a competent man, (who even now is competent for me), and in view of
the future examination of Christ, the just judge, whether he saw in us, or himself practiced
by imitation, the things that are now thrown in our teeth?</p>
<p>3. Augustin said: You call me to something else, when I had proposed to discuss faith,
but concerning your morals only those who are your Elect can fully know. But you know
that I was not your Elect, but an Auditor. Hence though I was present at your prayer
meetings,222 as you have asked (whether separately among yourselves you have any prayer
meetings, God alone and yourselves can know); yet in your prayer meetings where I have
been present I have seen nothing shameful take place; but only that the faith that I afterwards
learned and approved is denounced, and that you perform your services facing the sun.
Besides this I found out nothing new in your meetings, but whoever raises any question of
morals against you, raises it against your Elect. But what you who are Elect do among
yourselves, I have no means of knowing. For I have often heard from you that you receive
the Eucharist. But since the time of receiving it was concealed from me, how could I know
what you receive?223 So keep the question about morals, if you please, for discussion among

<note type="footnote">223 The allusion here is doubtless to the probably slanderous charge that the Manichæans were accustomed
to partake of human semen as a Eucharist. The Manichæan view of the relation of the substance mentioned to
the light, and their well-known opposition to procreation, give a slight plausibility to the charge. Compare the
Morals of the Manichæans, ch. xviii., where Augustin expresses his suspicions of Manichæan shamelessness.

your Elect, if it can be discussed. You gave me a faith that I today disapprove. This I proposed
to discuss. Let a response be made to my proposition.</p>
<p>Fortunatussaid: And our profession is this very thing: that God is incorruptible, lucid,
unapproachable, intenible, impassible, that He inhabits His own eternal lights, that nothing
corruptible proceeds from Him, neither darkness, demons, Satan, nor anything adverse can
be found in His kingdom. But that He sent forth a Saviour like Himself; that the Word born
from the foundation of the world, when He had formed the world, after the formation of
the world came among men; that He has chosen souls worthy of Himself according to His
own holy will, sanctified by celestial command, imbued with the faith and reason of celestial
things; that under His leadership those souls will return hence again to the kingdom of God
according to the holy promise of Him who said: "I am the way, the truth, and the door;"224
and "No one can come unto the Father, except through me." These things we believe because
otherwise, that is, through another mediator, souls cannot return to the kingdom of God,
unless they find Him as the way, the truth, and the door. For Himself said: "He that hath
seen me, hath seen my Father also;"225 and "whosoever shall have believed on me shall not
taste death forever, but has passed from death unto life, and shall not come into judgment."
226 These things we believe and this is the reason of our faith, and according to the
strength of our mind we endeavor to act according to His commandments, following after
the one faith of this Trinity, Father and Son and Holy Spirit.227</p>
<p>4. Augustin said: What was the cause of those souls being precipitated into death,
whom you confess come through Christ from death to life?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Hence now deign to go on and to contradict, if there is nothing besides
God.</p>
<p>5. Augustin said: Nay, do you deign to answer the question put to you: What cause
has given these souls to death?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Nay but do you deign to say whether there is anything besides God,
or all things are in God.</p>
<p>6. Augustin said: This I can reply, that the Lord wished me to know that God cannot
suffer any necessity, nor be violated or corrupted in any part. Which, since you also acknowledge,
I ask by what necessity He sent hither souls that you say return through Christ?</p>
<note type="footnote">224 This is, of course, a mixture of two passages of Scripture.—A.H.N.</note>

<note type="footnote">226 John v. 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">227 As remarked in the Introduction, the Manichæans of the West, in Augustin’s time, sustained a far more
intimate relation to Christianity than did Mani and his immediate followers. Far as Fortunatus may have been
from using the above language in the ordinary Christian sense, yet he held, by profession at least, enough of
Christian truth to beguile the unwary.—A.H.N.</note>

<pb n="193"/>
<p>Fortunatus said: What you have said: that thus far God has revealed to you, that He is
incorruptible, as He has also revealed to me; the reason must be sought, how and wherefore
souls have come into this world, so that now of right God should liberate them from this
world through his Son only begotten and like Himself, if besides Himself there is nothing?</p>
<p>7. Augustin said: We ought not to disappoint those present, being men of note, and
from the question proposed for discussion go to another. So we both confess, so we concede
to ourselves, that God is incorruptible and inviolable, and could have in no way suffered.
From which it follows, that your heresy is false, which says that God, when He saw desolation
and ruin threaten His kingdom, sent forth a power that should do battle with the race of
darkness, and that out of this commingling our souls are laboring. My argument is brief,
and as I suppose, perfectly clear to any one. If God could have suffered nothing from the
race of darkness because He is inviolable, without cause He sent us hither that we might
here suffer distress. But if anything can suffer, it is not inviolable, and you deceive those to
whom you say that God is inviolable. For this your heresy denies when you expound the
rest of it.</p>
<p>Fortunatussaid: We are of that mind in which the Apostle Paul instructs us, who says:
"Let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who when He had been constituted
in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but emptied Himself receiving
the form of a servant, having been made in the likeness of men, and having been
found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and was made obedient even unto death."
228 We have this mind therefore about ourselves, which we have also about Christ, who
when He was constituted in the form of God, was made obedient even unto death that He
might show the similitude of our souls. And like as He showed in Himself the similitude
of death, and having been raised from the midst of the dead showed that He was from the
Father, in the same manner we think it will be with our souls, because through Him we shall
have been able to be freed from this death, which is either alien from God, or if it belongs
to God, His mercy ceases, and the name of liberator, and the works of Him who liberates.229</p>
<p>8. Augustin said: I ask how we came into death, and you tell how we may be liberated
from death.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: So the apostle said that we ought to have that mind concerning ourselves
which Christ has shown us. If Christ was in suffering and death, so also are we.</p>

that is the Power and Wisdom of God,230 and the Word through whom all things have been

seems, against Mani, to have identified in some sense the Jesus that suffered with Christ. Yet even in this statement
his docetism is manifest.—A.H.N.</note>

made and without whom was not anything made,231 took upon Himself man to liberate
us. In the man whom He took upon Himself, He demonstrated those things that you spoke
of. But we now ask concerning the substance of God Himself and of Unspeakable Majesty,
whether anything can injure it or not. For if anything can injure it, He is not inviolable. If
nothing can injure the substance of God, what was the race of darkness about to do to it,
against which you say war was waged by God before the foundation of the world; in which
war you assert that we, that is souls that are now manifestly in need of a liberator, have been
commingled with every evil and implicated in death. For I return to that very brief statement:
If He could be injured, He is not inviolable; if He could not, He acted cruelly in sending us
hither to suffer these things.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Does the soul belong to God, or not?</p>
<p>10. Augustin said: If it is just that you should fail to respond to my questions, and that
I should be questioned, I will reply.
Fortunatus said: Does the soul act independently? This I ask of you.</p>
<p>11. Augustin said: I indeed will tell what you have asked; only remember this, that
while you have refused to respond to my questions, I have responded to yours. If you ask
whether the soul descended from God, it is indeed a great question; but whether it descends
from God or not, I make this reply concerning the soul, that it is not God; that God is one
thing, the soul another. That God is inviolable, incorruptible, and impenetrable, and incontaminable,
who also could be corrupted in no part and to whom no injury can be done in
any part. But we see also that the soul is sinful, and is conversant with misery, and seeks
the truth, and is in want of a liberator. This changing condition of the soul shows me that
the soul is not God. For if the soul is the substance of God, the substance of God errs, the
substance of God is corrupted, the substance of God is violated, the substance of God is
deceived; which it is impious to say.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Therefore you have denied that the soul is of God, so long as it serves
sins, and vices, and earthly things, and is led by error, because it cannot happen that either
God or His substance should suffer this thing. For God is incorruptible and His substance
immaculate and holy. But here it is inquired of you whether the soul is of God, or not?
Which we confess, and show from the advent of the Saviour, from His holy preaching, from
His election; while He pitied souls, and the soul is said to have come according to His will,
that He might free it from death and might bring it to eternal glory, and restore it to the
Father. But what do you say and hope concerning the soul; is it from God or not? Can the
substance of God, from which you deny that the soul has its being, be subject to no passions?</p>
<p>12. Augustin said: I have denied that the soul is the substance of God in the sense of
its being God; but yet I hold that it is from God as its author, because it was made by God.
<note type="footnote">231 John i. 3.</note>

<pb n="195"/>
The Maker is one thing, the thing made is another. He who made cannot be corruptible at
all, but what He made cannot be at all equal to Him who made it.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Nor have I said that the soul is like God. But because you have said
that the soul is an artificial thing, and that there is nothing besides God, I ask whence then
God invented the substance of the soul?</p>
<p>13. Augustin said: Only bear in mind that I reply to your interrogations, but that you
do not reply to mine. I say that the soul was made by God as all other things that were made
by God; and that among the things that God Almighty made the principal place was given
to the soul. But if you ask whence God made the soul, remember that you and I agree in
confessing that God is almighty. But he is not almighty who seeks the assistance of any
material whence he may make what he will. From which it follows, that according to our
faith, all things that God made through His Word and Wisdom, He made out of nothing.
For so we read: "He ordered and they were made; He commanded and they were created."232</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Do all things have their existence from God’s command?</p>
<p>14. Augustin said: So I believe, but all things which were made.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: As things made they agree, but because they are unsuitable to themselves,
therefore on this account it follows, that there is not one substance, although from
the same order of the One they came to the composition and fashioning of this world. But
it is plain in the things themselves that there is no similarity between darkness and light,
truth and falsehood, death and life, soul and body, and other similar things which differ
from each other both in names and appearances. And for good reason did our Lord say:
"The tree which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up and cast into the
fire, because it brings not forth good fruit:"233 and that the tree has been rooted up. Hence
truly it follows from the reason of things that there are two substances in this world which
agree in forms and in names, of which one belongs to corporeal natures, but the other is
the eternal substance of the omnipotent Father, which we believe to be God’s substance.</p>
<p>15. Augustin said: Those contrary things that move you so that we think adversely,
have happened on account of our sin, that is, on account of the sin of man. For God made
all things good, and ordered them well; but He did not make sin, and our voluntary sin is
the only thing that is called evil. There is another kind of evil, which is the penalty of sin.
Since therefore there are two kinds of evil, sin and the penalty of sin, sin does not pertain
to God; the penalty of sin pertains to the avenger. For as God is good who constituted all
things, so He is just in taking vengeance on sin. Since therefore all things are ordered in
the best possible way, which seem to us now to be adverse, it has deservedly happened to
fallen man who was unwilling to keep the law of God. For God gave free will to the rational
<note type="footnote">232 Ps. cxlviii. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">233 Matt. xv. 13, and iii. 10.</note>

<pb n="196"/>
soul which is in man. For thus it would have been possible to have merit, if we should be
good voluntarily and not of necessity. Since therefore it behooves us to be good not of necessity
but voluntarily, it behooved God to give to the soul free will. But to this soul obeying
His laws, He subjected all things without adversity, so that the rest of the things that God
made should serve it, if also the soul itself had willed to serve God. But if it should refuse
to serve God, those things that served it should be converted into its punishment. Wherefore
if all things are rightly ordered by God, and are good, neither does God suffer evil.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: He does not suffer, but prevents evil.</p>
<p>16. Augustin said: From whom then was He about to suffer it?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: This is my point, that He wished to prevent it, not rashly, but by power
and prescience. But deny evil to be apart from God, when other precepts can be shown
which are done apart from His will. A precept is not introduced, unless where there is
contrariety. The free faculty of living is not given except where there is a fall according to
the argument of the apostle who says: "And you did he quicken, when ye were dead in your
trespasses and sins, wherein aforetime ye walked according to the rulership of this world,
according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the souls
of disobedience; among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires
of the counsels of the flesh, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest: but God,
who is rich in all mercy, had mercy on us. And when we were dead by sins, quickened us
together in Christ, by whose grace ye have been saved; and at the same time also raised us
up, and made us to sit with Him in the heavenly places with Christ Jesus, that in the ages to
come He might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
For by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, for it is a gift of
God; not of works, lest any one should glory. For we are his workmanship created in Christ
Jesus in good works, which God prepared that we should walk in them. Wherefore remember,
that aforetime ye were Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision, by that
which is called circumcision in flesh made by hands, because ye were at that time without
Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers of the covenant, having
no hope of the promise, and without God in this world. But now in Christ Jesus, ye that
once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ. For He is our peace, who made both
one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in His flesh, making void
by His decrees the law of commandments, that in Himself He might unite the two into one
new man, making peace, that He might reconcile them both in one body unto God through
the cross, slaying the enmities in Himself. And He came and preached peace unto you that

<pb n="197"/>
were far off, and peace to them that were nigh. For through Him we both have our access
in one Spirit unto the Father." 234</p>
<p>17. Augustin said: This passage from the apostle, which you have thought fit to recite,
if I mistake not, makes very strongly for my faith and against yours. In the first place, because
free will itself, on which I have said that the possibility of the soul’s sinning depends, is here
sufficiently expressed, when sins are mentioned, and it is said that our reconciliation with
God takes place through Jesus Christ. For by sinning we were brought into opposition to
God; but by holding to the precepts of Christ we are reconciled to God; so that we who were
dead in sins may be made alive by keeping His precepts, and may have peace with Him in
one Spirit, from whom we were alienated, by failure to keep His precepts; as is set forth in
our faith concerning the man who was first created. I ask of you, therefore, according to
that passage which has been read, how can we have sins if contrary nature compels us to do
what we do? For he who is compelled by nature to do anything, does not sin. But he who
sins, sins by free will. Wherefore would repentance be enjoined upon us, if we have done
nothing evil, but only the race of darkness? Likewise, I ask, to whom is forgiveness of sins
granted, to us or to the race of darkness? If to the race of darkness, their race will also reign
with Him, receiving the forgiveness of sin; but if to us it is manifest that we have sinned
voluntarily. For it is the height of folly for him to be pardoned who has done no evil. But
he has done no evil, who has done nothing of his own will. Therefore the soul that today
promises itself forgiveness of sins and reconciliation to God, if it should cease to sin, and
repent of past sins: if it should answer according to your faith and should say: In what have
I sinned? In what am I guilty? Why hast Thou expelled me from Thy domains, that I might
do battle with some sort of race? I have been trodden under foot, I have been mixed up, I
have been corrupted, I am worn out,235 my free will has not been preserved. Thou knowest
the necessity by which I am preserved: Why dost Thou impute to me the wounds that I
have received? Wherefore dost Thou compel me to repentance when Thou art the cause of
my wounds; when Thou knowest what I have suffered, what the race of darkness has done
against me, Thou being the author who couldst suffer no harm and yet wishing to save the
domains which nothing could injure, Thou didst thrust me down into these miseries. If
indeed I am a part of Thee, who have proceeded from Thy bowels, if I am from Thy kingdom
and Thy mouth, I ought not to suffer anything in this race of darkness, so that I being uncorrupted
that race should be subjected, if I was a part of the Lord. But now since it cannot

be controlled except by my corruption, how can I either be said to be a part of Thee, or Thou
remain inviolable, or not be cruel in wishing me to suffer for those domains, that could in
no way be injured by that race of darkness? Respond to this if you please, and deign also
to explain to me how it was said by the apostle, "We were by nature children of wrath," who,
he says, have been reconciled to God. If therefore they were by nature children of wrath,
how do you say that the soul is by nature a daughter and portion of God?</p>
<p>Fortunatussaid: If with regard to the soul the apostle had said that we are by nature
children of wrath, the soul would have been alienated by the mouth of the apostle from
God. From this argument you only show that the soul does not belong to God, because, the
apostle says, "We are by nature children of wrath." But if it is said in view of the fact that
the apostle236 was held by the law, descending as he himself testifies, from the seed of Abraham,
it follows that he has said corporeally, that we [i.e., Jews] were children of wrath even
as the rest of mankind. But he shows that the substance of the soul is of God, and that the
soul cannot otherwise be reconciled to God than through the Master, who is Christ Jesus.
For the enmity having been slain, the soul seemed to God unworthy to have existed. But
that it was sent, this we confess, by God yet omnipotent, both deriving its origin from Him
and sent for the sealing of His will. In the same way we believe also that Christ the Saviour
came from heaven to fulfill the will of the Father. Which will of the Father was this, to free
our souls from the same enmity, this enmity having been slain, which if it had not been
opposed to God could neither be called enmity where there was unity, nor could slaying be
spoken of or take place where there was life.</p>
<p>18. Augustin said: Remember that the apostle said that we are alienated from God by
our manner of life.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: I submit, that there were two substances. In the substance of light, as
we have above said, God is to be held incorruptible; but that there was a contrary nature of
darkness, that which I also today confess is vanquished by the power of God, and that Christ
has been sent forth as a Saviour for my restoration, as previously the same apostle says.</p>
<p>19. Augustin said: That we should discuss on rational grounds the belief in two natures,
has been made obligatory by those who are hearing us. But inasmuch as you have again
betaken yourself to the Scriptures, I descend to them, and demand that nothing be passed
by, lest using certain statements we should bring confusion into the minds of those to whom
the Scriptures are not well known. Let us therefore consider a statement that the apostle
has in his epistle to the Romans. For on the first page is what is strongly against you. For
he says: "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel
of God, which He promised aforetime by His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, concerning
his Son, who was made unto Him of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was pre-
<note type="footnote">236 Rom. xi. 1.</note>

<pb n="199"/>
destinated to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness from the resurrection
from the dead of our Lord Jesus Christ."237 We see that the apostle teaches us
concerning our Lord Jesus Christ that before the flesh he was predestinated by the power
of God, and according to the flesh was made unto Him of the seed of David. Since you have
always denied and always will deny this, how do you so earnestly demand the Scriptures
that we should discuss rather according to them.</p>
<p>Fortunatussaid: You assert that according to the flesh Christ was of the seed of David,
when it should be asserted that he was born of a virgin,238 and should be magnified as Son
of God. For this cannot be, unless as what is from spirit may be held to be spirit, so also
what is from flesh may be known to be flesh.239 Against which is the authority of the Gospel
in which it is said, that "flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God, neither shall
corruption inherit incorruption."240</p>
<p>Here a clamor was made by the audience who wished the argument to be conducted
on rational grounds, because they saw that Fortunatus was not willing to receive all things
that are written in the Codex of the apostle. Then little discussions began to be held here
and there by all, until Fortunatus said that the Word of God has been fettered in the race of
darkness. At which, when those present had expressed their horror, the meeting was closed.

<head>Disputation of the Second Day.</head>
<p>The next day, a notary having again been summoned, the discussion was conducted as follows:</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: I say that God Almighty brings forth from Himself nothing evil, and
that the things that are His remain incorrupt, having sprung and being born from an inviolable
source; but other contrary things which have their being in this world, do not flow
from God nor have appeared in this world with God as their author; that is to say, they do
not derive their origin from God. These things therefore we have received in the belief that
evil things are foreign to God.</p>
<p>20. Augustin said: And our faith is this, that God is not the progenitor of evil things,
neither has He made any evil nature. But since both of us agree that God is incorruptible
and incontaminable, it is the part of the prudent and faithful to consider, which faith is
purer and worthier of the majesty of God; that in which it is asserted that either the power
of God, or some part of God, or the Word of God, can be changed, violated, corrupted,
fettered; or that in which it is said that Almighty God and His entire nature and substance
can never be corrupted in any part, but that evils have their being by the voluntary sin of
the soul, to which God gave free will. Which free will if God had not given, there could be
no just penal judgment, nor merit of righteous conduct, nor divine instruction to repent of
sins, nor the forgiveness of sins itself which God has bestowed upon us through our Lord
Jesus Christ. Because he who sins not voluntarily, sins not at all. This I suppose to be open
and perspicuous to all. Wherefore it ought not to trouble us if according to our deserts we
suffer some inconveniences in the things God has made. For as He is good, that He should
constitute all things; so He is just, that He may not spare sins, which sins, as I have said,
unless free will were in us, would not be sins. For if any one, so to speak, should be bound
by some one in his other members, and with his hand something false should be written
without his own will, I ask whether if this were laid open before a judge, he could condemn
this one for the crime of falsehood. Wherefore, if it is manifest that there is no sin where
there is not free exercise of will,242 I wish to hear what evil the soul which you call either
part, or power, or word, or something else, of God, has done, that it should be punished by
God, or repent of sin, or merit forgiveness, since it has in no way sinned?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: I proposed concerning substances, that God is to be regarded as creator
only of good things, but as the avenger of evil things, for the reason that evil things are not
of Him. Therefore for good reason I think this, and that God avenges evil things because
they are not of Himself. But if they were from Him, either He would give them license to
sin, as you say that God has given free will, He would be already found a participator in my
fault, because He would be the author of my fault; or ignorant what I should be, he left me
<note type="footnote">242 Liberum voluntatis arbitrium.</note>

<pb n="201"/>
whom he did not constitute worthy of Himself. This therefore is proposed by me, and what
I ask now is, whether God instituted evil or not? and whether He Himself instituted the end
of evils. For it appears from these things, and the evangelical faith teaches, that the things
which we have said were made by God Himself as God the Creator, as having been created
and begotten by Him, are to be esteemed incorruptible. These things I also proposed which
belong to our belief, and which can be confirmed by you in that profession of ours, without
prejudice to the authority of the Christian faith. And because I can in no way show that I
rightly believe, unless I should confirm that belief by the authority of the Scriptures, this is
therefore what I have insinuated, what I have said. Either if evil things have appeared in
the world with God as their author, deign to say so yourself; or if it is right to believe that
evil things are not of God, this also the contemplation of those present ought to honor and
receive. I have spoken about substances, not about sin that dwells in us. For if what we
think to make faults had no origin, we should not be compelled to come to sin or to fault.
For because we sinned unwillingly, and are compelled by a substance contrary and hostile
to ourselves, therefore we follow the knowledge of things. By which knowledge the soul
admonished and restored to pristine memory, recognizes the source from which it derives
its existence, in what evil it dwells, by what good works emending again that in which un-
willingly it sinned, it may be able through the emendation of its faults, for the sake of good
works, to secure for itself the merit of reconciliation with God, our Saviour being the author
of it, who teaches us also to practice good things and to flee from evil. For you ask us to
believe that not by some contrary nature, but by his own choice, man either serves righteousness
or becomes involved in sins; since, no contrary race existing, if the soul, to which as
you say God has given free will, having been constituted in the body, dwells alone, it would
be without sin, nor would it become involved in sins.</p>
<p>21. Augustin said: I say it is not sin, if it be not committed by one’s own will; hence
also there is reward, because of our own will we do right. Or if he who sins unwillingly deserves
punishment, he who unwillingly does well ought to deserve reward. But who doubts
that reward is only bestowed upon him who does something of good will? From which we
know that punishment also is inflicted upon him who does something of ill will. But since
you recall me to primordial natures and substances, my faith is that God Almighty—which
must especially be attended to and fixed in the mind—that God Almighty has made good
things. But the things made by Him cannot be such as is He who made them. For it is unjust
and foolish to believe that works are equal to the workman, things made to the maker.
Wherefore if it is reverential to believe that God made all good things, than which nevertheless
He is by far more excellent and by far more pre-eminent; the origin and head of evil is sin,
as the apostle said: "Covetousness is the root of all evils; which some following after have
made shipwreck of the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows."243
<note type="footnote">243 1 Tim. vi. 10.</note>

<pb n="202"/>
For if you seek the root of all evils, you have the apostle saying that covetousness is the root
of all evils. But the root of a root I cannot seek. Or if there is another evil, whose root covetousness
is not, covetousness will not be the root of all evils. But if it is true that covetousness
is the root of all evils, in vain do we seek some other kind of evil. But as regards that contrary
nature of yours which you introduce, since I have responded to your objections, I ask that
you deign to tell me whether it is wholly evil, whether there can be no sin apart from it,
whether by this alone punishment is deserved, not by the soul by which no sin has been
committed. But if you say that this contrary nature alone deserves punishment, and not
the soul, I ask to which is repentance, which is commanded, vouchsafed. If the soul is
commanded to repent, sin is from the soul, and the soul has sinned voluntarily. For if the
soul is compelled to do evil, that which it does is not evil. Is it not foolish and most absurd
to say that the race of darkness has sinned and that I repent of the sins. Is it not most absurd
to say that the race of darkness has sinned and that forgiveness of sins is vouchsafed to me,
who according to your faith may well say: What have I done? What have I committed? I
was with Thee, I was in a state of integrity, I was contaminated with no pollution. Thou
didst send me hither, Thou didst suffer necessity, Thou didst protect Thy domains when
great pollution and desolation threatened them. Since therefore Thou knowest the necessity
by which I have been here oppressed, by reason of which I could not breathe, which I could
not resist; why dost Thou accuse me as if sinning? or why dost Thou promise forgiveness
of sins? Reply to this without evasion, if you please, as I have replied to you.</p>
<p>Fortunatussaid: We say this, that the soul is compelled by contrary nature to transgress,
for which transgression you maintain there is no root save the evil that dwells in us; for it
is certain that apart from our bodies evil things dwell in the whole world. For not those
things alone that we have in our bodies, dwell in the whole world, and are known by their
names as good; an evil root also inheres. For your dignity said that this covetousness that
dwells in our bodies is the root of evils; since therefore there is no desire of evil out of our
bodies, from that source contrary nature dwells in the whole world. For the apostle designated
that, namely covetousness, as the root of evils, not one evil which you have called the
root of all evils. But not in one manner is covetousness, which you have said is the root of
all evils, understood, as if of that which dwells in our bodies alone; for it is certain that this
evil which dwells in us descends from an evil author and that this root as you call it is a small
portion of evil, so that it is not the root itself, but is a small portion of evil, of that evil which
dwells everywhere. Which root and tree our Lord called evil, as never bearing good fruit,
which his Father did not plant, and which is deservedly rooted up and cast into the fire.244
For as you say, that sin ought to be imputed to the contrary nature, that nature belongs to
evil; and that this is sin of the soul, if after the warning of our Saviour and his wholesome
<note type="footnote">244 Matt. xv. 13, and iii. 10.</note>

<pb n="203"/>
instruction, the soul shall have segregated itself from its contrary and hostile race, adorning
itself also with purer things; that otherwise it cannot be restored to its own substance. For
it is said: "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin. But now that I
have come and spoken, and they have refused to believe me, they shall have no excuse for
their sin."245 Whence it is perfectly plain, that repentance has been given after the Saviour’s
advent, and after this knowledge of things, by which the soul can, as if washed in a divine
fountain from the filth and vices as well of the whole world as of the bodies in which the
same soul dwells, be restored to the kingdom of God whence it has gone forth. For it is said
by the apostle, that "the mind of the flesh is hostile to God; is not subject to the law of God,
neither indeed can be."246 Therefore it is evident from these things that the good soul seems
to sin not voluntarily, but by the doing of that which is not subject to the law of God. For
it likewise follows that "the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh; so
that ye may not do the things that ye will."247 Again: "I see another law in my members,
warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive in the law of sin and of death.
Therefore I am a miserable man; who shall deliver me from the body of this death, unless
it be the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"248 "through whom the world has been
crucified to me and I to the world?"249</p>
<p>22. Augustin said: I recognize and embrace the testimonies of the divine Scriptures,
and I will show in a few words, as God may deign to grant, how they are consistent with my
faith. I say that there was free exercise of will in that man who was first formed. He was so
made that absolutely nothing could resist his will, if he had willed to keep the precepts of
God. But after he voluntarily sinned, we who have descended from his stock were plunged
into necessity. But each one of us can by a little consideration find that what I say is true.
For today in our actions before we are implicated by any habit, we have free choice of doing
anything or not doing it. But when by that liberty we have done something and the pernicious
sweetness and pleasure of that deed has taken hold upon the mind, by its own habit the
mind is so implicated that afterwards it cannot conquer what by sinning it has fashioned
for itself. We see many who do not wish to swear, but because the tongue has already become
habituated, they are not able to prevent those things from going forth from the mouth which
we cannot but ascribe to the root of evil. For that I may discuss with you those words, which
as they do not withdraw from your mouth so may they be understood by your heart: you
swear by the Paraclete. If therefore you wish to find out experimentally whether what I say

<pb n="204"/>
is true, determine not to swear. You will see, that that habit is borne along as it has become
accustomed to be. And this is what wars against the soul, habit formed in the flesh. This
is indeed the mind of the flesh, which, as long as it cannot thus be subject to the law of God,
so long is it the mind of the flesh; but when the soul has been illuminated it ceases to be the
mind of the flesh. For thus it is said the mind of the flesh cannot be subject to the law of
God, just as if it were said, that snow cannot be warm. For so long as it is snow, it can in
no way be warm. But as the snow is melted by heat, so that it may become warm, so the
mind of the flesh, that is, habit formed with the flesh, when our mind has become illuminated,
that is, when God has subjected for Himself the whole man to the choice of the divine law,
instead of the evil habit of the soul, makes a good habit. Accordingly it is most truly said
by the Lord of the two trees, the one good and the other evil, which you have called to mind,
that they have their own fruits; that is, neither can the good tree yield evil fruit, nor the evil
tree good fruit, but so long as it is evil. Let us take two men, a good and a bad. As long as
he is good he cannot yield evil fruit; as long as he is bad he cannot yield good fruit. But that
you may know that those two trees are so placed by the Lord, that free choice may be there
signified, that these two trees are not natures but our wills, He Himself says in the gospel:
"Either make the tree good, or make the tree evil."250 Who is it that can make nature? If
therefore we are commanded to make a tree either good or evil, it is ours to choose what
we will. Therefore concerning that sin of man and concerning that habit of soul formed
with the flesh the apostle says: "Let no one seduce you;"251 "Every creature that has been
made by God is good."252 The same apostle whom you also have cited says: "As through
the disobedience of the one the many were constituted sinners; so also through the obedience
of the one the many are constituted righteous."253 "Since through man is death, through
man also is resurrection of the dead." As long therefore as we bear the image of the earthly
man,254 that is, as long as we live according to the flesh, which is also called the old man,
we have the necessity of our habit, so that we may not do what we will. But when the grace
of God has breathed the divine love into us and has made us subject to His will, to us it is
said: "Ye are called for freedom,"255 and "the grace of God has made me free from the law
of sin and of death."256 But the law of sin is that whoever has sinned shall die. From this
law we are freed when we have begun to be righteous. The law of death is that by which it

was said to man: "Earth thou art and into earth thou shalt go."257 For from this very fact
we are all so born, because we are earth, and from the fact that we are all so born because
we are earth, we shall all go into earth on account of the desert of the sins of the first man.
But on account of the grace of God, which frees us from the law of sin and of death, having
been converted to righteousness we are freed; so that afterwards this same flesh tortures us
with its punishment so long as we remain in sins, is subjected to us in resurrection, and
shakes us by no adversity from keeping the law of God and His precepts. Whence, since I
have replied to your questions, deign to reply as I desire, how it can happen, that if nature
is contrary to God, sin should be imputed to us, who were sent into that nature not voluntarily,
but by God Himself, whom nothing could injure?</p>
<p>Fortunatussaid: Just as also the Lord said to His disciples: "Behold I send you as sheep
in the midst of wolves."258 Hence it must be known that not with hostile intent did our
Saviour send forth His lambs, that is His disciples, into the midst of wolves, unless there
had been some contrariety, which He would indicate by the similitude of wolves, where also
He had sent His disciples; that the souls which perchance might be deceived in the midst
of wolves might be recalled to their proper substance. Hence also may appear the antiquity
of our times to which we return, and of our years, that before the foundation of the world
souls were sent in this way against the contrary nature, that subjecting the same by their
passion, victory might be restored to God. For the same apostle said, that not only there
should be a struggle against flesh and blood, but also against principalities and powers, and
the spiritual things of wickedness, and the domination of darkness."259 If therefore in both
places evils dwell and are esteemed wickednesses, not only now is evil in our bodies, but in
the whole world, where souls appear to dwell, which dwell beneath yonder heaven and are
fettered.</p>
<p>23. Augustin said: The Lord sent His lambs into the midst of wolves, that is, just men
into the midst of sinners for the preaching of the gospel received in the time of man from
the inestimable divine Wisdom, that He might call us from sin to righteousness. But what
the apostle says, that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities
and powers, and the other things that have been quoted, this signifies that the devil and his
angels, as also we, have fallen and lapsed by sin, and have secured possession of earthly
things, that is, sinful men, who, as long as we are sinners, are under their yoke, just as when
we shall be righteous, we shall be under the yoke of righteousness; and against them we have
a struggle, that passing over to righteousness we may be freed from their dominion. Do

<pb n="206"/>
you also therefore deign to reply to the one question that I ask: Could God suffer injury,
or not? But I ask you to reply: He could not.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: He could not suffer injury.</p>
<p>24. Augustin said: Wherefore then did He send us hither, according to your faith?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: My profession is this, that God could not be injured, and that He directed
us hither. But since this is contrary to your view, do you tell how you account for the
soul being here, which our God desires to liberate both by His commandments and by His
own Son whom He has sent.</p>
<p>25. Augustin said: Since I see that you cannot answer my inquiries, and wish to ask
me something, behold I satisfy you, provided only that you bear in mind that you have not
replied to my question. Why the soul is here in this world involved in miseries has been
explained by me not just now, but again and again a little while ago. The soul sinned, and
therefore is miserable. It accepted free choice, used free choice, as it willed; it fell, was cast
out from blessedness, was implicated in miseries. As bearing upon this I recited to you the
testimony of the apostle who says: "As through one man death, so also through one man
came the resurrection of the dead." What more do you ask? Hence do you reply, wherefore
did He, who could not suffer injury, send us hither?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: The cause must be sought, why the soul came hither, or wherefore
God desires hence to liberate the soul that lives in the midst of evils?</p>
<p>26. Augustin said: This cause I ask of you, that is, if God could not suffer injury,
wherefore He sent us hither?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: It is inquired of us, if evil cannot injure God, wherefore the soul was
sent hither, or for what reason was it mingled with the world? Which is manifest in what
the apostle says: "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou formed
me thus?"260 If therefore this cause must be pleaded, He must be asked, why He sent the
soul, no necessity compelling Him. But if there was necessity for sending the soul, of right
is there also the will of liberating it.</p>
<p>27. Augustin said: Then God is pressed by necessity, is He?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Now this is it. Do not seek to bring odium upon what has been said
because we do not make God subject to necessity, but to have voluntarily sent the soul.</p>
<p>28. Augustin said: Recall what was said above. And it runs: "But if there was necessity
for sending the soul, of right is there also the will of liberating it. Augustin said: We have
heard: But if there was necessity for sending the soul, of right is there also the will of liberating
it." You, therefore, said that there was necessity for sending the soul. But if you only
wish to say "a will to send," I add this also: He who could suffer no injury, had the cruel will
to send the soul to so great miseries. Because I speak for the sake of refuting this statement,
<note type="footnote">260 Rom. ix. 20.</note>

<pb n="207"/>
I ask pardon from the mercy of that One in whom we have hope of liberation from all the
errors of heretics.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: You asseverate that we say that God is cruel in sending the soul, but
that God made man, breathed into him a soul which assuredly He foreknew to be involved
in future misery, and not to be able by reason of evils to be restored to its inheritance. This
belongs either to one who is ignorant, or who gives the soul up to these aforesaid evils. This
I have cited because you said not long since, that God adopted the soul, not that it is from
Him; for to adopt is a different matter.</p>
<p>29. Augustin said: Concerning adoption I remember that I spoke some days ago according
to the testimony of the apostle, who says that we have been called into the adoption
of sons.261 This was not my reply, therefore, but the apostle’s, concerning which thing, that
is, that adoption, we may inquire, if we please, in its own time; and concerning that I will
reply without delay, when you shall have answered my objections.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: I say that there was a going forth of the soul against a contrary nature,
which nature could not injure God.</p>
<p>30. Augustin said: What need was there for that going forth, when God whom nothing
could injure had nothing to protect?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Do you conscientiously hold that Christ came from God?</p>
<p>31. Augustin said: Again you are questioning me. Reply to my inquiries.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: So I have received in faith, that by the will of God He came hither.</p>
<p>32. Augustin said: And I say: Why did God, omnipotent, inviolable, immutable, whom
nothing could injure, send hither the soul, to miseries, to error, to those things that we suffer?</p>
<p>Fortunatussaid: For it has been said: "I have power to lay down my soul and I have
power to take it again."262 Now He said that by the will of God the soul went forth.</p>
<p>33. Augustin said: I ask for the reason why God, when He can in no way suffer injury,
sent the soul hither?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: We have already said that God can in no way suffer injury, and we
have said that the soul is in a contrary nature, therefore that it imposes a limit on the contrary
nature. The restraint having been imposed on the contrary nature, God takes the same.
For He Himself said, "I have power to lay down my soul and power to take it." The Father
gave to me the power of laying down my soul, and of taking it. To what soul, therefore, did
God who spoke in the Son refer? Evidently our soul, which is held in these bodies, which
came of His will, and of His will is again taken up.</p>
<note type="footnote">261 Eph. i. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">262 John x. 18.</note>

<pb n="208"/>
<p>34. Augustin said: Why our Lord said: "I have power to lay down my soul and power
to take it," is known to all; because He was about to suffer and to rise again. But I ask of you
again and again, If God could in no way suffer injury, why did he send souls hither?</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: To impose a limit on contrary nature.</p>
<p>35. Augustin said: And did God omnipotent, merciful and supreme, that He might
impose a restraint on contrary nature, wish it to be limited so that He might make us unrestrained?
Fortunatus said: But so He calls us back to Himself.</p>
<p>36. Augustin said: If He recalls to Himself from an unrestrained state, if from sin, from
error, from misery, what need was there for the soul to suffer so great evils through so long
a time till the world ends? since God by whom you say it was sent could in no way suffer
injury.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: What then am I to say?</p>
<p>37. Augustin said: I know that you have nothing to say, and that I, when I was among
you, never found anything to say on this question, and that I was thus admonished from
on high to leave that error and to be converted to the Catholic faith or rather to recall it, by
the indulgence of Him who did not permit me to inhere forever in this fallacy. But if you
confess that you have nothing to reply, I will expound the Catholic faith to all those hearing
and investigating, seeing that they are believers, if they permit and wish.</p>
<p>Fortunatus said: Without prejudice to my profession I might say: when I shall have
reconsidered with my superiors the things that have been opposed by you, if they fail to respond
to this question of mine, which is now in like manner proposed to me by you, it will
be in my contemplation (since I desire my soul to be liberated by an assured faith) to come
to the investigation of this thing that you have proposed to me and that you promise you
will show.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.—To Heal Heretics is Better Than to Destroy Them.</head>
<p>1. My prayer to the one true, almighty God, of whom, and through whom, and in whom
are all things, has been, and is now, that in opposing and refuting the heresy of you
Manichæans, as you may after all be heretics more from thoughtlessness than from malice,
He would give me a mind calm and composed, and aiming at your recovery rather than at
your discomfiture. For while the Lord, by His servants, overthrows the kingdoms of error,
His will concerning erring men, as far as they are men, is that they should be amended rather
than destroyed. And in every case where, previous to the final judgment, God inflicts punishment,
whether through the wicked or the righteous, whether through the unintelligent
or through the intelligent, whether in secret or openly, we must believe that the designed
effect is the healing of men, and not their ruin; while there is a preparation for the final
doom in the case of those who reject the means of recovery. Thus, as the universe contains
some things which serve for bodily punishment, as fire, poison, disease, and the rest, and
other things, in which the mind is punished, not by bodily distress, but by the entanglements
of its own passions, such as loss, exile, bereavement, reproach, and the like; while other
things, again, without tormenting are fitted to comfort and soothe the languishing, as, for
example, consolations, exhortations, discussions, and such things; in all these the supreme
justice of God makes use sometimes even of wicked men, acting in ignorance, and sometimes
of good men, acting intelligently. It is ours, accordingly, to desire in preference the better
part, that we might attain our end in your correction, not by contention, and strife, and
persecutions, but by kindly consolation, by friendly exhortation, by quiet discussion; as it
is written, "The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle toward all men, apt to

Manichæus, called Fundamental, refutes only its commencement; but on the other parts of the epistle I have
made notes, as required, refuting the whole, and sufficient to recall the argument, had I ever had leisure to write
against the whole." [The Fundamental Epistle seems to have been a sort of hand-book for Manichæan catechumens
or Auditors. In making this document the basis of his attack, Augustin felt that he had selected the best-known
and most generally accepted standard of the Manichæan faith. The tone of the work is conciliatory, yet some
very sharp thrusts are made at Manichæan error. The claims of Mani to be the Paraclete are set aside, and the
absurd cosmological fancies of Mani are ruthlessly exposed. Dualism is combated with substantially the same
weapons as in the treatise Concerning Two Souls. We could wish that the author had found time to finish the
treatise, and had thus preserved for us more of the Fundamental Epistle itself. This work was written after the
author had become Bishop of Hippo.—A.H.N.]</note>

<p>2. Let those rage against you who know not with what labor the truth is to be found
and with what difficulty error is to be avoided. Let those rage against you who know not
how rare and hard it is to overcome the fancies of the flesh by the serenity of a pious disposition.
Let those rage against you who know not the difficulty of curing the eye of the inner
man that he may gaze upon his Sun,—not that sun which you worship, and which shines

which it is written through the prophet, "The Sun of righteousness has arisen upon me;"265

cometh into the world."266 Let those rage against you who know not with what sighs and

against you who have never been led astray in the same way that they see that you are.</p>

the cure of my mental obscuration, in compliance with the call and the tender persuasion
of the all-merciful Physician; who long wept that the immutable and inviolable Existence
would vouchsafe to convince me inwardly of Himself, in harmony with the testimony of
the sacred books; by whom, in fine, all those fictions which have such a firm hold on you,
from your long familiarity with them, were diligently examined, and attentively heard, and
too easily believed, and commended at every opportunity to the belief of others, and defended
against opponents with determination and boldness,—I can on no account rage against you;
for I must bear with you now as formerly I had to bear with myself, and I must be as patient
towards you as my associates were with me, when I went madly and blindly astray in your
beliefs.</p>
<p>4. On the other hand, all must allow that you owe it to me, in return, to lay aside all

truth; let us seek it as if it were unknown to us both. For truth can be sought with zeal and
unanimity if by no rash presumption it is believed to have been already found and ascertained.
But if I cannot induce you to grant me this, at least allow me to suppose myself a
stranger now for the first time hearing you, for the first time examining your doctrines. I
think my demand a just one. And it must be laid down as an understood thing that I am

<head>Chapter 4.—Proofs of the Catholic Faith.</head>
<p>5. For in the Catholic Church, not to speak of the purest wisdom, to the knowledge of
which a few spiritual men attain in this life, so as to know it, in the scantiest measure, indeed,
because they are but men, still without any uncertainty (since the rest of the multitude derive
their entire security not from acuteness of intellect, but from simplicity of faith,)—not to
speak of this wisdom, which you do not believe to be in the Catholic Church, there are many
other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The consent of peoples and nations
keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope,
enlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me, beginning from
the very seat of the Apostle Peter, to whom the Lord, after His resurrection, gave it in charge
to feed His sheep, down to the present episcopate. And so, lastly, does the name itself of
Catholic, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained;
so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the
Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house. Such
then in number and importance are the precious ties belonging to the Christian name which
keep a believer in the Catholic Church, as it is right they should, though from the slowness
of our understanding, or the small attainment of our life, the truth may not yet fully disclose
itself. But with you, where there is none of these things to attract or keep me, the promise
of truth is the only thing that comes into play. Now if the truth is so clearly proved as to
leave no possibility of doubt, it must be set before all the things that keep me in the Catholic
Church; but if there is only a promise without any fulfillment, no one shall move me from
the faith which binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion.</p>

<pb n="215"/>
<head>Chapter 5.—Against the Title of the Epistle of Manichæus.</head>
<p>6. Let us see then what Manichæus teaches me; and particularly let us examine that
treatise which he calls the Fundamental Epistle, in which almost all that you believe is contained.
For in that unhappy time when we read it we were in your opinion enlightened.
The epistle begins thus:—"Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the providence of God
the Father. These are wholesome words from the perennial and living fountain." Now, if
you please, patiently give heed to my inquiry. I do not believe Manichæus to be an apostle
of Christ. Do not, I beg of you, be enraged and begin to curse. For you know that it is my
rule to believe none of your statements without consideration. Therefore I ask, who is this
Manichæus? You will reply, An apostle of Christ. I do not believe it. Now you are at a loss
what to say or do; for you promised to give knowledge of the truth, and here you are forcing
me to believe what I have no knowledge of. Perhaps you will read the gospel to me, and
will attempt to find there a testimony to Manichæus. But should you meet with a person
not yet believing the gospel, how would you reply to him were he to say, I do not believe?
For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic
Church.267 So when those on whose authority I have consented to believe in the gospel tell
me not to believe in Manichæus, how can I but consent? Take your choice. If you say, Believe
the Catholics: their advice to me is to put no faith in you; so that, believing them, I am
precluded from believing you;—If you say, Do not believe the Catholics: you cannot fairly
use the gospel in bringing me to faith in Manichæus; for it was at the command of the
Catholics that I believed the gospel;—Again, if you say, You were right in believing the
Catholics when they praised the gospel, but wrong in believing their vituperation of
Manichæus: do you think me such a fool as to believe or not to believe as you like or dislike,
without any reason? It is therefore fairer and safer by far for me, having in one instance put
faith in the Catholics, not to go over to you, till, instead of bidding me believe, you make
me understand something in the clearest and most open manner. To convince me, then,
you must put aside the gospel. If you keep to the gospel, I will keep to those who commanded
me to believe the gospel; and, in obedience to them, I will not believe you at all. But if haply
you should succeed in finding in the gospel an incontrovertible testimony to the apostleship
of Manichæus, you will weaken my regard for the authority of the Catholics who bid me
not to believe you; and the effect of that will be, that I shall no longer be able to believe the
gospel either, for it was through the Catholics that I got my faith in it; and so, whatever you
bring from the gospel will no longer have any weight with me. Wherefore, if no clear proof
of the apostleship of Manichæus is found in the gospel, I will believe the Catholics rather
than you. But if you read thence some passage clearly in favor of Manichæus, I will believe
<note type="footnote">267 [This is one of the earliest distinct assertions of the dependence of the Scriptures for authority on the
Church.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="216"/>
neither them nor you: not them, for they lied to me about you; nor you, for you quote to
me that Scripture which I had believed on the authority of those liars. But far be it that I
should not believe the gospel; for believing it, I find no way of believing you too. For the
names of the apostles, as there recorded,268 do not include the name of Manichæus. And
who the successor of Christ’s betrayer was we read in the Acts of the Apostles;269 which
book I must needs believe if I believe the gospel, since both writings alike Catholic authority
commends to me. The same book contains the well-known narrative of the calling and
apostleship of Paul.270 Read me now, if you can, in the gospel where Manichæus is called
an apostle, or in any other book in which I have professed to believe. Will you read the
passage where the Lord promised the Holy Spirit as a Paraclete, to the apostles? Concerning
which passage, behold how many and how great are the things that restrain and deter me
from believing in Manichæus.</p>

<head>Chapter 6.—Why Manichæus Called Himself an Apostle of Christ.</head>
<p>7. For I am at a loss to see why this epistle begins, "Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus
Christ," and not Paraclete, an apostle of Jesus Christ. Or if the Paraclete sent by Christ sent
Manichæus, why do we read, "Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus Christ," instead of Manichæus,
an apostle of the Paraclete? If you say that it is Christ Himself who is the Holy Spirit, you
contradict the very Scripture, where the Lord says, "And I will send you another Paraclete."
271 Again, if you justify your putting of Christ’s name, not because it is Christ Himself who
is also the Paraclete, but because they are both of the same substance,—that is, not because
they are one person, but one existence [non quia unus est, sed quia unum sunt],—Paul too
might have used the words, Paul, an apostle of God the Father; for the Lord said, "I and the
Father are one."272 Paul nowhere uses these words; nor does any of the apostles write
himself an apostle of the Father. Why then this new fashion? Does it not savor of trickery
of some kind or other? For if he thought it made no difference, why did he not for the sake
of variety in some epistles call himself an apostle of Christ, and in others of the Paraclete?
But in every one that I know of, he writes, of Christ; and not once, of the Paraclete. What
do we suppose to be the reason of this, but that pride, the mother of all heretics, impelled
the man to desire to seem to have been sent by the Paraclete, but to have been taken into so
close a relation as to get the name of Paraclete himself? As the man Jesus Christ was not
sent by the Son of God, that is, the power and wisdom of God—by which all things were
made, but, according to the Catholic faith, was taken into such a relation as to be Himself
the Son of God—that is, that in Himself the wisdom of God was displayed in the healing of
sinners,—so Manichæus wished it to be thought that he was so taken up by the Holy Spirit,
whom Christ promised, that we are henceforth to understand that the names Manichæus
and Holy Spirit alike signify the apostle of Jesus Christ,—that is, one sent by Jesus Christ,
who promised to send him. Singular audacity this! and unutterable sacrilege!</p>

<head>Chapter 7.—In What Sense the Followers of Manichæus Believe Him to Be the Holy
Spirit.</head>
<p>8. Besides, you should explain how it is that, while the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are
united in equality of nature, as you also acknowledge, you are not ashamed to speak of
Manichæus, a man taken into union with the Holy Spirit, as born of ordinary generation;
and yet you shrink from believing that the man taken into union with the only-begotten
Wisdom of God was born of a Virgin. If human flesh, if generation [concubitus viri], if the
womb of a woman could not contaminate the Holy Spirit, how could the Virgin’s womb
contaminate the Wisdom of God? This Manichæus, then, who boasts of a connection with
the Holy Spirit, and of being spoken of in the gospel, must produce his claim to either of
these two things,—that he was sent by the Spirit, or that he was taken into union with the
Spirit. If he was sent, let him call himself the apostle of the Paraclete; if taken into union,
let him allow that He whom the only-begotten Son took upon Himself had a human mother,
since he admits a human father as well as mother in the case of one taken up by the Holy
Spirit. Let him believe that the Word of God was not defiled by the virgin womb of Mary,
since he exhorts us to believe that the Holy Spirit could not be defiled by the married life of
his parents. But if you say that Manichæus was united to the Spirit, not in the womb or
before conception, but after his birth, still you must admit that he had a fleshly nature derived
from man and woman. And since you are not afraid to speak of the blood and the bodily
substance of Manichæus as coming from ordinary generation, or of the internal impurities
contained in his flesh, and hold that the Holy Spirit, who took on Himself, as you believe,
this human being, was not contaminated by all those things, why should I shrink from
speaking of the Virgin’s womb and body undefiled, and not rather believe that the Wisdom
of God in union with the human being in his mother’s flesh still remained free from stain
and pollution? Wherefore, as, whether your Manichæus professes to be sent by or to be
united with the Paraclete, neither statement can hold good, I am on my guard, and refuse
to believe either in his mission or in his susception.</p>

<pb n="219"/>
<head>Chapter 8.—The Festival of the Birth-Day of Manichæus.</head>
<p>9. In adding the words, "by the providence of God the Father," what else did Manichæus
design but that, having got the name of Jesus Christ, whose apostle he calls himself, and of
God the Father, by whose providence he says he was sent by the Son, we should believe
himself, as the Holy Spirit, to be the third person? His words are: "Manichæus, an apostle
of Jesus Christ, by the providence of God the Father." The Holy Spirit is not named, though
He ought specially to have been named by one who quotes to us in favor of his apostleship
the promise of the Paraclete, that he may prevail upon ignorant people by the authority of
the gospel. In reply to this, you of course say that in the name of the Apostle Manichæus
we have the name of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, because He condescended to come into
Manichæus. Why then, I ask again, should you cry out against the doctrine of the Catholic
Church, that He in whom divine Wisdom came was born of a virgin, when you do not
scruple to affirm the birth by ordinary generation of him in whom you say the Holy Spirit
came? I cannot but suspect that this Manichæus, who uses the name of Christ to gain access
to the minds of the ignorant, wished to be worshipped instead of Christ Himself. I will state
briefly the reason of this conjecture. At the time when I was a student of your doctrines, to
my frequent inquiries why it was that the Paschal feast of the Lord was celebrated generally
with no interest, though sometimes there were a few languid worshippers, but no watchings,
no prescription of any unusual fast,—in a word, no special ceremony,—while great honor
is paid to your Bema, that is, the day on which Manichæus was killed, when you have a
platform with fine steps, covered with precious cloth, placed conspicuously so as to face the
votaries,—the reply was, that the day to observe was the day of the passion of him who really
suffered, and that Christ, who was not born, but appeared to human eyes in an unreal
semblance of flesh, only feigned suffering, without really bearing it. Is it not deplorable,
that men who wish to be called Christians are afraid of a virgin’s womb as likely to defile
the truth, and yet are not afraid of falsehood? But to go back to the point, who that pays
attention can help suspecting that the intention of Manichæus in denying Christ’s being
born of a woman, and having a human body, was that His passion, the time of which is now
a great festival all over the world, might not be observed by the believers in himself, so as
to lessen the devotion of the solemn commemoration which he wished in honor of the day
of his own death? For to us it was a great attraction in the feast of the Bema that it was held
during Pascha, since we used all the more earnestly to desire that festal day [the Bema], that
the other which was formerly most sweet had been withdrawn.</p>

<head>Chapter 9.—When the Holy Spirit Was Sent.</head>
<p>10. Perhaps you will say to me, When, then, did the Paraclete promised by the Lord
come? As regards this, had I nothing else to believe on the subject, I should rather look for
the Paraclete as still to come, than allow that He came in Manichæus. But seeing that the
advent of the Holy Spirit is narrated with perfect clearness in the Acts of the Apostles, where
is the necessity of my so gratuitously running the risk of believing heretics? For in the Acts
it is written as follows: "The former treatise have we made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus
began both to do and teach, in the day in which He chose the apostles by the Holy Spirit,
and commanded them to preach the gospel. By those to whom He showed Himself alive
after His passion by many proofs in the daytime, He was seen forty days, teaching concerning
the kingdom of God. And how He conversed with them, and commanded them that they
should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith He,
ye have heard of me. For John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall begin to be baptized
with the Holy Spirit, whom also ye shall receive after not many days, that is, at Pentecost.
When they had come, they asked him, saying, Lord, wilt Thou at this time manifest Thyself?
And when will be the kingdom of Israel? And He said unto them, No one can know the
time which the Father hath put in His own power. But ye shall receive the power of the
Holy Ghost coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in
all Judæa, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."273 Behold you have
here the Lord reminding His disciples of the promise of the Father, which they had heard
from His mouth, of the coming of the Holy Spirit. Let us now see when He was sent; for
shortly after we read as follows: "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were
all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a
rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared
unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all
filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation
under heaven. And when the sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were
confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all
amazed, and marvelled, saying one to another, Are not all these which speak Galilæans?
and how heard we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? Parthians, and
Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Armenia, and in Cappadocia, in
Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the regions of Africa about Cyrene,
and strangers of Rome, Jews, natives, Cretes, and Arabians, they heard them speak in their
own tongues the wonderful works of God. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt
on account of what had happened, saying, What meaneth this? But others, mocking, said,
<note type="footnote">273 Acts i. 1-8.</note>

<pb n="221"/>
These men are full of new wine."274 You see when the Holy Spirit came. What more do
you wish? If the Scriptures are credible, should not I believe most readily in these Acts,
which have the strongest testimony in their support, and which have had the advantage of
becoming generally known, and of being handed down and of being publicly taught along
with the gospel itself, which contains the promise of the Holy Spirit, which also we believe?
On reading, then, these Acts of the Apostles, which stand, as regards authority, on a level
with the gospel, I find that not only was the Holy Spirit promised to these true apostles, but
that He was also sent so manifestly, that no room was left for errors on this subject.</p>

<head>Chapter 10.—The Holy Spirit Twice Given.</head>
<p>11. For the glorification of our Lord among men is His resurrection from the dead and
His ascension to heaven. For it is written in the Gospel according to John: "The Holy Ghost
was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified."275 Now if the reason why He
was not given was that Jesus was not yet glorified, He was given immediately on the glorification
of Jesus. And since that glorification was twofold, as regards man and as regards God,
twice also was the Holy Spirit given: once, when, after His resurrection from the dead, He
breathed on the face of His disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost;"276 and again, ten
days after His ascension to heaven. This number ten signifies perfection; for to the number
seven which embraces all created things, is added the trinity of the Creator.277 On these
things there is much pious and sober discourse among spiritual men. But I must keep to
my point; for my business at present is not to teach you, which you might think presumptuous,
but to take the part of an inquirer, and learn from you, as I tried to do for nine years
without success. Now, therefore, I have a document to believe on the subject of the Holy
Spirit’s advent; and if you bid me not to believe this document, as your usual advice is not
to believe ignorantly, without consideration,278 much less will I believe your documents.
Away, then, with all books, and disclose the truth with logical clearness, so as to leave no
doubt in my mind; or bring forward books where I shall find not an imperious demand for
my belief, but a trustworthy statement of what I may learn. Perhaps you say this epistle is
also of this character. Let me, then, no longer stop at the threshold: let us see the contents.</p>

<head>Chapter 11.—Manichæus Promises Truth, But Does Not Make Good His Word.</head>
<p>12. "These," he says, "are wholesome words from the perennial and living fountain; and
whoever shall have heard them, and shall have first believed them, and then shall have observed
the truths they set forth, shall never suffer death, but shall enjoy eternal life in glory.
For he is to be judged truly blessed who has been instructed in this divine knowledge, by
which he is made free and shall abide in everlasting life." And this, as you see, is a promise
of truth, but not the bestowal of it. And you yourselves can easily see that any errors whatever
might be dressed up in this fashion, so as under cover of a showy exterior to steal in unawares
into the minds of the ignorant. Were he to say, These are pestiferous words from a poisonous
fountain; and whoever shall have heard them, and shall have first believed them, and then
have observed what they set forth, shall never be restored to life, but shall suffer a woful
death as a criminal: for assuredly he is to be pronounced miserable who falls into this infernal
error, in which he will sink so as to abide in everlasting torments;—were he to say this, he
would say the truth; but instead of gaining any readers for his book, he would excite the
greatest aversion in the minds of all into whose hands the book might come. Let us then
pass on to what follows; nor let us be deceived by words which may be used alike by good
and bad, by learned and unlearned. What, then, comes next?</p>
<p>13. "May the peace," he says, "of the invisible God, and the knowledge of the truth, be
with the holy and beloved brethren who both believe and also yield obedience to the divine
precepts." Amen, say we. For the prayer is a most amiable and commendable one. Only
we must bear in mind that these words might be used by false teachers as well as by good
ones. So, if he said nothing more than this, all might safely read and embrace it. Nor should
I disapprove of what follows: "May also the right hand of light protect you, and deliver you
from every hostile assault, and from the snares of the world." In fact, I have no fault to find
with the beginning of this epistle, till we come to the main subject of it. For I wish not to
spend time on minor points. Now, then, for this writer’s plain statement of what is to be
expected from him.</p>

<head>Chapter 12.—The Wild Fancies of Manichæus. The Battle Before the Constitution
of the World.</head>
<p>14. "Of that matter," he says, "beloved brother of Patticus, of which you told me, saying
that you desired to know the manner of the birth of Adam and Eve, whether they were
produced by a word or sprung from matter, I will answer you as is fit. For in various writings
and narratives we find different assertions made and different descriptions given by many
authors. Now the real truth on the subject is unknown to all peoples, even to those who
have long and frequently treated of it. For had they arrived at a clear knowledge of the
generation of Adam and Eve, they would not have remained liable to corruption and death."
Here, then, is a promise to us of clear knowledge of this matter, so that we shall not be liable
to corruption and death. And if this does not suffice, see what follows: "Necessarily," he
says, "many things have to be said by way of preface, before a discovery of this mystery free
from all uncertainty can be made." This is precisely what I asked for, to have such evidence
of the truth as to free my knowledge of it from all uncertainty. And even were the promise
not made by this writer himself, it was proper for me to demand and to insist upon this, so
that no opposition should make me ashamed of becoming a Manichæan from a Catholic
Christian, in view of such a gain as that of perfectly clear and certain truth. Now, then, let
us hear what he has to state.</p>
<p>15. "Accordingly," he says, "hear first, if you please, what happened before the constitution
of the world, and how the battle was carried on, that you may be able to distinguish the
nature of light from that of darkness." Such are the utterly false and incredible statements
which this writer makes. Who can believe that any battle was fought before the constitution
of the world? And even supposing it credible, we wish now to get something to know, not
to believe. For to say that the Persians and Scythians long ago fought with one another is
a credible statement; but while we believe it when we read or hear it, we cannot know it as
a fact of experience or as a truth of the understanding. So, then, as I would repudiate any
such statement on the ground that I have been promised something, not that I must believe
on authority, but that I shall understand without any ambiguity; still less will I receive
statements which are not only uncertain, but incredible. But what if he have some evidence
to make these things clear and intelligible? Let us hear, then, if we can, what follows with
all possible patience and forbearance.</p>

<head>Chapter 13.—Two Opposite Substances. The Kingdom of Light. Manichæus Teaches
Uncertainties Instead of Certainties.</head>
<p>16. "In the beginning, then," he says, "these two substances were divided. The empire
of light was held by God the Father, who is perpetual in holy origin, magnificent in virtue,
true in His very nature, ever rejoicing in His own eternity, possessing in Himself wisdom
and the vital senses, by which He also includes the twelve members of His light, which are
the plentiful resources of his kingdom. Also in each of His members are stored thousands
of untold and priceless treasures. But the Father Himself, chief in praise, incomprehensible
in greatness, has united to Himself happy and glorious worlds, incalculable in number and
duration, along with which this holy and illustrious Father and Progenitor resides, no poverty
or infirmity being admitted in His magnificent realms. And these matchless realms are so
founded on the region of light and bliss, that no one can ever move or disturb them."279</p>
<p>17. Where is the proof of all this? And where did Manichæus learn it? Do not frighten
me with the name of the Paraclete. For, in the first place, I have come not to put faith in
unknown things, but to get the knowledge of undoubted truths, according to the caution

without consideration. And what is more, this writer, who here begins to tell of very
doubtful things, himself promised a little before to give complete and well-grounded

<head>Chapter 14.—Manichæus Promises the Knowledge of Undoubted Things, and Then
Demands Faith in Doubtful Things.</head>
<p>In the next place, if faith is what is required of me, I should prefer to keep to the Scripture,
which tells me that the Holy Spirit came and inspired the apostles, to whom the Lord had
promised to send Him. You must therefore prove, either that what Manichæus says is true,
and so make clear to me what I am unable to believe; or that Manichæus is the Holy Spirit,
and so lead me to believe in what you cannot make clear. For I profess the Catholic faith,
and by it I expect to attain certain knowledge. Since, then, you try to overthrow my faith,
you must supply me with certain knowledge, if you can, that you may convict me of having
adopted my present belief without consideration. You make two distinct propositions,—one
when you say that the speaker is the Holy Spirit, and another when you say that what the
speaker teaches is evidently true. I might fairly ask undeniable proof for both propositions.
But I am not greedy and require to be convinced only of one. Prove this person to be the
Holy Spirit, and I will believe what he says to be true, even without understanding it; or
prove that what he says is true, and I will believe him to be the Holy Spirit, even without
evidence. Could anything be fairer or kinder than this? But you cannot prove either one
or other of these propositions. You can find nothing better than to praise your own faith
and ridicule mine. So, after having in my turn praised my belief and ridiculed yours, what
result do you think we shall arrive at as regards our judgment and our conduct, but to part
company with those who promise the knowledge of indubitable things, and then demand
from us faith in doubtful things? while we shall follow those who invite us to begin with
believing what we cannot yet fully perceive, that, strengthened by this very faith, we may
come into a position to know what we believe by the inward illumination and confirmation
of our minds, due no longer to men, but to God Himself.</p>
<p>18. And as I have asked this writer to prove these things to me, I ask him now where
he learned them himself. If he replies that they were revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, and
that his mind was divinely enlightened that he might know them to be certain and evident,
he himself points to the distinction between knowing and believing. The knowledge is his
to whom these things are fully made known as proved; but in the case of those who only
hear his account of these things, there is no knowledge imparted, but only a believing acquiescence
required. Whoever thoughtlessly yields this becomes a Manichæan, not by knowing
undoubted truth, but by believing doubtful statements. Such were we when in our inexperienced
youth we were deceived. Instead, therefore, of promising knowledge, or clear evidence,
or the settlement of the question free from all uncertainty, Manichæus ought to have said
that these things were clearly proved to him, but that those who hear his account of them
must believe him without evidence. But were he to say this, who would not reply to him,
If I must believe without knowing, why should I not prefer to believe those things which
have a widespread notoriety from the consent of learned and unlearned, and which among

<pb n="227"/>
all nations are established by the weightiest authority? From fear of having this said to him,
Manichæus bewilders the inexperienced by first promising the knowledge of certain truths,
and then demanding faith in doubtful things. And then, if he is asked to make it plain that
these things have been proved to himself, he fails again, and bids us believe this too. Who
can tolerate such imposture and arrogance?</p>

<head>Chapter 15.—The Doctrine of Manichæus Not Only Uncertain, But False. His Absurd
Fancy of a Land and Race of Darkness Bordering on the Holy Region and the
Substance of God. The Error, First of All, of Giving to the Nature of God Limits
and Borders, as If God Were a Material Substance, Having Extension in Space.</head>
<p>19. What if I shall have shown, with the help of God and of our Lord, that this writer’s
statements are false as well as uncertain? What more unfortunate thing can be found than
that superstition which not only fails to impart the knowledge and the truth which it
promises, but also teaches what is directly opposed to knowledge and truth? This will appear
more clearly from what follows: "In one direction on the border of this bright and holy land
there was a land of darkness deep and vast in extent, where abode fiery bodies, destructive
races. Here was boundless darkness, flowing from the same source in immeasurable
abundance, with the productions properly belonging to it. Beyond this were muddy turbid
waters with their inhabitants; and inside of them winds terrible and violent with their prince
and their progenitors. Then again a fiery region of destruction, with its chiefs and peoples.
And similarly inside of this a race full of smoke and gloom, where abode the dreadful prince
and chief of all, having around him innumerable princes, himself the mind and source of
them all. Such are the five natures of the pestiferous land."</p>
<p>20. To speak of God as an aerial or even as an ethereal body is absurd in the view of all
who, with a clear mind, possessing some measure of discernment, can perceive the nature
of wisdom and truth as not extended or scattered in space, but as great, and imparting
greatness without material size, nor confined more or less in any direction, but throughout
co-extensive with the Father of all, nor having one thing here and another there, but everywhere
perfect, everywhere present.280</p>

<pb n="229"/>
<head>Chapter 16.—The Soul, Though Mutable, Has No Material Form. It is All Present
in Every Part of the Body.</head>
<p>But why speak of truth and wisdom which surpass all the powers of the soul, when the
nature of the soul itself, which is known to be mutable, still has no kind of material extension
in space? For whatever consists of any kind of gross matter must necessarily be divisible
into parts, having one in one place, and another in another. Thus, the finger is less than the
whole hand, and one finger is less than two; and there is one place for this finger, and another
for that, and another for the rest of the hand. And this applies not to organized bodies only,
but also to the earth, each part of which has its own place, so that one cannot be where the
other is. So in moisture, the smaller quantity occupies a smaller space, and the larger
quantity a larger space; and one part is at the bottom of the cup, and another part near the
mouth. So in air, each part has its own place; and it is impossible for the air in this house
to have along with itself, in the same house at the same moment, the air that the neighbors
have. And even as regards light itself, one part pours through one window, and another
through another; and a greater through the larger, and a smaller through the smaller. Nor,
in fact, can there be any bodily substance, whether celestial or terrestrial, whether aerial or
moist, which is not less in part than in whole, or which can possibly have one part in the
place of another at the same time; but, having one thing in one place and another in another,
its extension in space is a substance which has distinct limits and parts, or, so to speak, sections.
The nature of the soul, on the other hand, though we leave out of account its power
of perceiving truth, and consider only its inferior power of giving unity to the body, and of
sensation in the body, does not appear to have any material extension in space. For it is all
present in each separate part of its body when it is all present in any sensation. There is not
a smaller part in the finger, and a larger in the arm, as the bulk of the finger is less than that
of the arm; but the quantity everywhere is the same, for the whole is present everywhere.
For when the finger is touched, the whole mind feels, though the sensation is not through
the whole body. No part of the mind is unconscious of the touch, which proves the presence
of the whole. And yet it is not so present in the finger or in the sensation as to abandon the
rest of the body, or to gather itself up into the one place where the sensation occurs. For
when it is all present in the sensation in a finger, if another part, say the foot, be touched, it
does not fail to be all present in this sensation too: so that at the same moment it is all
present in different places, without leaving one in order to be in the other, and without
having one part in one, and another in the other; but by this power showing itself to be all
present at the same moment in separate places. Since it is all present in the sensations of
these places, it proves that it is not bound by the conditions of space.281</p>

<p>Again, if we consider the mind’s power of remembering not the objects of the intellect,
but material objects, such as we see brutes also remembering (for cattle find their way without
mistake in familiar places, and animals return to their cribs, and dogs recognize the persons
of their masters, and when asleep they often growl, or break out into a bark, which could
not be unless their mind retained the images of things before seen or perceived by some
bodily sense), who can conceive rightly where these images are contained, where they are
kept, or where they are formed? If, indeed, these images were no larger than the size of our
body, it might be said that the mind shapes and retains them in the bodily space which
contains itself. But while the body occupies a small material space, the mind revolves images
of vast extent, of heaven and earth, with no want of room, though they come and go in
crowds; so that clearly, the mind is not diffused through space: for instead of being contained
in images of the largest spaces, it rather contains them; not, however, in any material receptacle,
but by a mysterious faculty or power, by which it can increase or diminish them, can
contract them within narrow limits, or expand them indefinitely, can arrange or disarrange
them at pleasure, can multiply them or reduce them to a few or to one.</p>

<p>What, then, must be said of the power of perceiving truth, and of making a vigorous
resistance against these very images which take their shape from impressions on the bodily
senses, when they are opposed to the truth? This power discerns the difference between, to
take a particular example, the true Carthage and its own imaginary one, which it changes
as it pleases with perfect ease. It shows that the countless worlds of Epicurus, in which his
fancy roamed without restraint, are due to the same power of imagination, and, not to
multiply examples, that we get from the same source that land of light, with its boundless
extent, and the five dens of the race of darkness, with their inmates, in which the fancies of
Manichæus have dared to usurp for themselves the name of truth. What then is this power
which discerns these things? Clearly, whatever its extent may be, it is greater than all these
things, and is conceived of without any such material images. Find, if you can, space for
this power; give it a material extension; provide it with a body of huge size. Assuredly if
you think well, you cannot. For of everything of this corporeal nature your mind forms an
opinion as to its divisibility, and you make of such things one part greater and another less,
as much as you like; while that by which you form a judgment of these things you perceive
to be above them, not in local loftiness of place, but in dignity of power.</p>

<head>Chapter 19.—If the Mind Has No Material Extension, Much Less Has God.</head>
<p>21. So then, if the mind, so liable to change, whether from a multitude of dissimilar
desires, or from feelings varying according to the abundance or the want of desirable things,
or from these endless sports of the fancy, or from forgetfulness and remembrance, or from
learning and ignorance; if the mind, I say, exposed to frequent change from these and the
like causes, is perceived to be without any local or material extension, and to have a vigor
of action which surmounts these material conditions, what must we think or conclude of
God Himself, who remains superior to all intelligent beings in His freedom from perturbation
and from change, giving to every one what is due? Him the mind dares to express more
easily than to see; and the clearer the sight, the less is the power of expression. And yet this
God, if, as the Manichæan fables are constantly asserting, He were limited in extension in
one direction and unlimited in others, could be measured by so many subdivisions or fractions
of greater or less size, as every one might fancy; so that, for example, a division of the
extent of two feet would be less by eight parts than one of ten feet. For this is the property
of all natures which have extension in space, and therefore cannot be all in one place. But
even with the mind this is not the case; and this degrading and perverted idea of the mind
is found among people who are unfit for such investigations.</p>

<head>Chapter 20.—Refutation of the Absurd Idea of Two Territories.</head>
<p>22. But perhaps, instead of thus addressing carnal minds, we should rather descend to
the views of those who either dare not or are as yet unfit to turn from the consideration of
material things to the study of an immaterial and spiritual nature, and who thus are unable
to reflect upon their own power of reflection, so as to see how it forms a judgment of material
extension without itself possessing it. Let us descend then to these material ideas, and
let us ask in what direction, and on what border of the shining and sacred territory, to use
the expressions of Manichæus, was the region of darkness? For he speaks of one direction
and border, without saying which, whether the right or the left. In any case, it is clear that
to speak of one side implies that there is another. But where there are three or more sides,
either the figure is bounded in all directions, or if it extends infinitely in one direction, still
it must be limited in the directions where it has sides. If, then, on one side of the region of
light there was the race of darkness, what bounded it on the other side or sides? The
Manichæans say nothing in reply to this; but when pressed, they say that on the other sides
the region of light, as they call it, is infinite, that is, extends throughout boundless space.
They do not see, what is plain to the dullest understanding, that in that case there could be
no sides? For the sides are where it is bounded. What, then, he says, though there are no
sides? But what you said of one direction or side, implied of necessity the existence of another
direction and side, or other directions and sides. For if there was only one side, you
should have said, on the side, not on one side; as in reference to our body we say properly,
By one eye, because there is another; or on one breast, because there is another. But if we
spoke of a thing as being on one nose, or one navel, we should be ridiculed by learned and
unlearned, since there is only one. But I do not insist on words, for you may have used one
in the sense of the only one.</p>

<p>What, then, bordered on the side of the region which you call shining and sacred? The
region, you reply, of darkness. Do you then allow this latter region to have been material?
Of course you must, since you assert that all bodies derive their origin from it. How then
is it that, dull and carnal as you are, you do not see that unless both regions were material,
they could not have their sides joined to one another? How could you ever be so blinded
in mind as to say that only the region of darkness was material, and that the so-called region
of light was immaterial and spiritual? My good friends, let us open our eyes for once, and
see, now that we are told of it, what is most obvious, that two regions cannot be joined at
their sides unless both are material.</p>
<p>23. Or if we are too dull and stupid to see this, let us hear whether the region of darkness
too has one side, and is boundless in the other directions, like the region of light. They do
not hold this from fear of making it seem equal to God. Accordingly they make it boundless
in depth and in length; but upwards, above it, they maintain that there is an infinity of empty
space. And lest this region should appear to be a fraction equal in amount to half of that
representing the region of light, they narrow it also on two sides. As if, to give the simplest
illustration, a piece of bread were made into four squares, three white and one black; then
suppose the three white pieces joined as one, and conceive them as infinite upwards and
downwards, and backwards in all directions: this represents the Manichæan region of light.
Then conceive the black square infinite downwards and backwards, but with infinite
emptiness above it: this is their region of darkness. But these are secrets which they disclose
to very eager and anxious inquirers.</p>

<p>Well, then, if this is so, the region of darkness is clearly touched on two sides by the region
of light. And if it is touched on two sides, it must touch on two. So much for its being on
one side, as we were told before.</p>
<p>24. And what an unseemly appearance is this of the region of light!—like a cloven arch,
with a black wedge inserted below, bounded only in the direction of the cleft, and having a
void space interposed where the boundless emptiness stretches above the region of darkness.
Indeed, the form of the region of darkness is better than that of the region of light: for the
former cleaves, the latter is cloven; the former fills the gap which is made in the latter; the
former has no void in it, while the latter is undefined in all directions, except that where it
is filled up by the wedge of darkness. In an ignorant and greedy notion of giving more
honor to a number of pans than to a single one, so that the region of light should have six,
three upwards and three downwards, they have made this region be split up, instead of
sundering the other. For, according to this figure, though there may be no commixture of
darkness with light, there is certainly penetration.</p>

<head>Chapter 23.—The Anthropomorphites Not So Bad as the Manichæans.</head>
<p>25. Compare, now, not spiritual men of the Catholic faith, whose mind, as far as is
possible in this life, perceives that the divine substance and nature has no material extension,
and has no shape bounded by lines, but the carnal and weak of our faith, who, when they
hear the members of the body used figuratively, as, when God’s eyes or ears are spoken of,
are accustomed, in the license of fancy, to picture God to themselves in a human form;
compare these with the Manichæans, whose custom it is to make known their silly stories
to anxious inquirers as if they were great mysteries: and consider who have the most allowable
and respectable ideas of God, —those who think of Him as having a human form which
is the most excellent of its kind, or those who think of Him as having boundless material
extension, yet not in all directions, but with three parts infinite and solid, while in one part
He is cloven, with an empty void, and with undefined space above, while the region of
darkness is inserted wedge-like below. Or perhaps the proper expression is, that He is unconfined
above in His own nature, but encroached on below by a hostile nature. I join with
you in laughing at the folly of carnal men, unable as yet to form spiritual conceptions, who
think of God as having a human form. Do you too join me, if you can, in laughing at those
whose unhappy conceptions represent God as having a shape cloven or cut in such an unseemly
and unbecoming way, with such an empty gap above, and such a dishonorable curtailment
below. Besides, there is this difference, that these carnal people, who think of God
as having a human form, if they are content to be nourished with milk from the breast of
the Catholic Church, and do not rush headlong into rash opinions, but cultivate in the
Church the pious habit of inquiry, and there ask that they may receive, and knock that it
may be opened to them, begin to understand spiritually the figures and parables of the
Scriptures, and gradually to perceive that the divine energies are suitably set forth under
the name, sometimes of ears, sometimes of eyes, sometimes of hands or feet, or even of
wings and feathers a shield too, and sword, and helmet, and all the other innumerable things.
And the more progress they make in this understanding, the more are they confirmed as
Catholics. The Manichæans, on the other hand, when they abandon their material fancies,
cease to be Manichæans. For this is the chief and special point in their praises of Manichæus,
that the divine mysteries which were taught figuratively in books from ancient times were
kept for Manichæus, who was to come last, to solve and demonstrate; and so after him no
other teacher will come from God, for he has said nothing in figures or parables, but has
explained ancient sayings of that kind, and has himself taught in plain, simple terms.
Therefore, when the Manichæans hear these words of their founder, on one side and border
of the shining and sacred region was the region of darkness, they have no interpretations
to fall back on. Wherever they turn, the wretched bondage of their own fancies brings them
upon clefts or sudden stoppages and joinings or sunderings of the most unseemly kind,
which it would be shocking to believe as true of any immaterial nature, even though mutable,

<pb n="237"/>
like the mind, not to speak of the immutable nature of God. And yet if I were unable to rise
to higher things, and to bring my thoughts from the entanglement of false imaginations
which are impressed on the memory by the bodily senses, into the freedom and purity of
spiritual existence, how much better would it be to think of God as in the form of a man,
than to fasten that wedge of darkness to His lower edge, and, for want of a covering for the
boundless vacuity above to leave it void and unoccupied throughout infinite space! What
notion could be worse than this? What darker error can be taught or imagined?</p>

<pb n="238"/>
<head>Chapter 24.—Of the Number of Natures in the Manichæan Fiction.</head>
<p>26. Again, I wish to know, when I read of God the Father and His kingdoms founded
on the shining and happy region, whether the Father and His kingdoms, and the region,
are all of the same nature and substance. If they are, then it is not another nature or sort of
body of God which the wedge of the race of darkness cleaves and penetrates, which itself is
an unspeakably revolting thing, but it is actually the very nature of God which undergoes
this. Think of this, I beseech you: as you are men, think of it, and flee from it; and if by
tearing open your breasts you can cast out by the roots such profane fancies from your faith,
I pray you to do it. Or will you say that these three are not of one and the same nature, but
that the Father is of one, the kingdoms of another, and the region of another, so that each
has a peculiar nature and substance, and that they are arranged according to their degree
of excellence? If this is true, Manichæus should have taught that there are four natures, not
two; or if the Father and the kingdoms have one nature, and the region only one of its own,
he should have made three. Or if he made only two, because the region of darkness does
not belong to God, in what sense does the region of light belong to God? For if it has a
nature of its own, and if God neither generated nor made it, it does not belong to Him, and
the seat of His kingdom is in what belongs to another. Or if it belongs to Him because of
its vicinity, the region of darkness must do so too; for it not only borders on the region of
light, but penetrates it so as to sever it in two. Again, if God generated it, it cannot have a
separate nature. For what is generated by God must be what God is, as the Catholic Church
believes of the only begotten Son. So you are brought back of necessity to that shocking
and detestable profanity, that the wedge of darkness sunders not a region distinct and separate
from God, but the very nature of God. Or if God did not generate, but make it, of
what did He make it? Or if of Himself, what is this but to generate? If of some other nature,
was this nature good or evil? If good, there must have been some good nature not belonging
to God; which you will scarcely have the boldness to assert. If evil, the race of darkness
cannot have been the only evil nature. Or did God take a part of that region and turn it into
a region of light, in order to found His kingdom upon it? If He had, He would have taken
the whole, and there would have been no evil nature left. If God, then, did not make the
region of light of a substance distinct from His own, He must have made it of nothing.282</p>

Impropriety or Absurdity.</head>
<p>27. If, then, you are now convinced that God is able to create some good thing out of
nothing, come into the Catholic Church, and learn that all the natures which God has created
and founded in their order of excellence from the highest to the lowest are good, and some
better than others; and that they were made of nothing, though God, their Maker, made use
of His own wisdom as an instrument, so to speak, to give being to what was not, and that
as far as it had being it might be good, and that the limitation of its being might show that
it was not begotten by God, but made out of nothing. If you examine the matter, you will
find nothing to keep you from agreeing to this. For you cannot make your region of light
to be what God is, without making the dark section an infringement on the very nature of
God. Nor can you say that it was generated by God, without being reduced to the same
enormity, from the necessity of concluding that as begotten of God, it must be what God
is. Nor can you say that it was distinct from Him, lest you should be forced to admit that
God placed His kingdom in what did not belong to Him, and that there are three natures.
Nor can you say that God made it of a substance distinct from His own, without making
something good besides God, or something evil besides the race of darkness. It remains,
therefore that you must confess that God made the region of light out of nothing: and you
are unwilling to believe this; because if God could make out of nothing some great good
which yet was inferior to Himself, He could also, since He is good, and grudges no good,
make another good inferior to the former, and again a third inferior to the second, and so
on, in order down to the lowest good of created natures, so that the whole aggregate, instead
of extending indefinitely without number or measure should have a fixed and definite consistency.
Again, if you will not allow this either, that God made the region of light out of
nothing, you will have no escape from the shocking profanities to which your opinions lead.</p>
<p>28. Perhaps, since the carnal imagination can fancy any shapes it likes, you might be
able to devise some other form for the junction of the two regions, instead of presenting to
the mind such a disagreeable and painful description as this, that the region of God,
whether it be of the same nature as God or not, where at least God’s kingdoms are founded,
lies through immensity in such a huge mass that its members stretch loosely to an infinite
extent, and that on their lower part that wedge of the region of darkness, itself of boundless
size encroaches upon them. But whatever other form you contrive for the junction of these
two regions, you cannot erase what Manichæus has written. I refer not to other treatises
where a more particular description is given,—for perhaps, because they are in the hands
of only a few, there might not be so much difficulty with them,—but to this Fundamental
Epistle which we are now considering, with which all of you who are called enlightened are

you please, draw any kind of lines you like, it is certain that the junction of this boundless
mass of the region of darkness to the region of light must have been either by a straight line,
or a curved, or a tortuous one. If the line of junction is tortuous the side of the region of
light must also be tortuous; otherwise its straight side joined to a tortuous one would leave
gaps of infinite depth, instead of having vacuity only above the land of darkness, as we were
told before. And if there were such gaps, how much better it would have been for the region
of light to have been still more distant, and to have had a greater vacuity between, so that
the region of darkness might not touch it at all! Then there might have been such a gap of
bottomless depth, that, on the rise of any mischief in that race, although the chiefs of darkness
might have the foolhardy wish to cross over, they would fall headlong into the gap (for
bodies cannot fly without air to support them); and as there is infinite space downwards,
they could do no more harm, though they might live for ever, for they would be for ever
falling. Again, if the line of junction was a curved one, the region of light must also have
had the disfigurement of a curve to answer it. Or if the land of darkness were curved inwards
like a theatre, there would be as much disfigurement in the corresponding line in the region
of light. Or if the region of darkness had a curved line, and the region of light a straight
one, they cannot have touched at all points. And certainly, as I said before, it would have
been better if they had not touched, and if there was such a gap between that the regions
might be kept distinctly separate, and that rash evildoers might fall headlong so as to be
harmless. If, then, the line of junction was a straight one, there remain, of course, no more
gaps or grooves, but, on the contrary, so perfect a junction as to make the greatest possible
peace and harmony between the two regions. What more beautiful or more suitable than
that one side should meet the other in a straight line, without bends or breaks to disturb the
natural and permanent connection throughout endless space and endless duration? And
even though there was a separation, the straight sides of both regions would be beautiful in
themselves, as being straight; and besides, even in spite of an interval, their correspondence,
as running parallel, though not meeting, would give a symmetry to both. With the addition
of the junction, both regions become perfectly regular and harmonious; for nothing can be
devised more beautiful in description or in conception than this junction of two straight
lines.283</p>

<p>29. What is to be done with unhappy minds, perverse in error, and held fast by custom?
These men do not know what they say when they say those things; for they do not consider.
Listen to me; no one forces you, no one quarrels with you, no one taunts you with past errors,
unless some one who has not experienced the divine mercy in deliverance from error: all
we desire is that the errors should some time or other be abandoned. Think a little without
animosity or bitterness. We are all human beings: let us hate, not one another, but errors
and lies. Think a little, I pray you. God of mercy, help them to think, and kindle in the
minds of inquirers the true light. If anything is plain, is not this, that right is better than
wrong? Give me, then, a calm and quiet answer to this, whether making crooked the right
line of the region of darkness which joins on to the right line of the region of light, would
not detract from its beauty. If you will not be dogged, you must confess that not only is
beauty taken from it by its being made crooked, but also the beauty which it might have had
from connection with the right line of the region of light. Is it the case, then, that in this
loss of beauty, in which right is made crooked, and harmony becomes discord, and agreement
disagreement, there is any loss of substance? Learn, then, from this that substance is not
evil; but as in the body, by change of form for the worse, beauty is lost, or rather lessened,
and what was called fair before is said to be ugly, and what was pleasing becomes displeasing,
so in the mind the seemliness of a right will, which makes a just and pious life, is injured
when the will changes for the worse; and by this sin the mind becomes miserable, instead
of enjoying as before the happiness which comes from the ornament of a right will, without
any gain or loss of substance.</p>
<p>30. Consider, again, that though we admit that the border of the region of darkness was
evil for other reasons, such as that it was dim and dark, or any other reason, still it was not
evil in being straight. So, if I admit that there was some evil in its color, you must admit
that there was some good in its straightness. Whatever the amount of this good, it is not
allowable to attribute it to any other than God the Maker, from whom we must believe that
all good in whatsoever nature comes, if we are to escape deadly error. It is absurd, then, to
say that this region is perfect evil, when in its straightness of border is found the good of
not a little beauty of a material kind; and also to make this region to be altogether estranged,
from the almighty and good God, when this good which we find in it can be attributed to
no other but the author of all good things. But this border, too, we are told, was evil. Well,
suppose it evil: it would surely have been worse had it been crooked instead of straight.
And how can that be the perfection of evil than which something worse than itself can be

<pb n="243"/>
thought of? And to be worse implies that there is some good, the want of which makes the
thing worse. Here the want of straightness would make the line worse. Therefore its
straightness is something good. And you will never answer the question whence this
goodness comes, without reference to Him from whom we must acknowledge that all good
things come, whether small or great. But now we shall pass on from considering this border
to something else.</p>

<head>Chapter 28.—Manichæus Places Five Natures in the Region of Darkness.</head>
<p>31. "There dwelt," he says, "in that region fiery bodies, destructive races." By speaking
of dwelling, he must mean that those bodies were animated and in life. But, not to appear
to cavil at a word, let us see how he divides into five classes all these inhabitants of this region.
"Here," he says, "was boundless darkness, flowing from the same source in immeasurable
abundance, with the productions properly belonging to it. Beyond this were muddy turbid
waters, with their inhabitants; and inside of them winds terrible and violent, with their
prince and their progenitors. Then, again, a fiery region of destruction, with its chiefs and
peoples. And, similarly, inside of this a race full of smoke and gloom, where abode the
dreadful prince and chief of all, having around him innumerable princes, himself the mind
and source of them all. Such are the five natures of the pestiferous region." We find here
five natures mentioned as part of one nature, which he calls the pestiferous region. The
natures are darkness, waters, winds, fire, smoke; which he so arranges as to make darkness
first, beginning at the outside. Inside of darkness he puts the waters; inside of the waters,
the winds; inside of the winds, the fire; inside of the fire, the smoke. And each of these
natures had its peculiar kind of inhabitants, which were likewise five in number. For to the
question, Whether there was only one kind in all, or different kinds corresponding to the
different natures; the reply is, that they were different: as in other books we find it stated
that the darkness had serpents; the waters swimming creatures, such as fish; the winds flying
creatures, such as birds; the fire quadrupeds, such as horses, lions, and the like; the smoke
bipeds, such as men.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
<pb n="245"/>
<head>Chapter 29.—The Refutation of This Absurdity.</head>
<p>32. Whose arrangement, then, is this? Who made the distinctions and the classification?
Who gave the number, the qualities, the forms, the life? For all these things are in themselves
good, nor could each of the natures have them except from the bestowal of God, the author
of all good things. For this is not like the descriptions or suppositions of poets about an
imaginary chaos, as being a shapeless mass, without form, without quality, without measurement,
without weight and number, without order and variety; a confused something,
absolutely destitute of qualities, so that some Greek writers call it ἄποιον. So far from being
like this is the Manichæan description of the region of darkness, as they call it, that, in a
directly contrary style, they add side to side, and join border to border; they number five
natures; they separate, arrange, and assign to each its own qualities. Nor do they leave the
natures barren or waste, but people them with their proper inhabitants; and to these, again,
they give suitable forms, and adapted to their place of habitation, besides giving the chief
of all endowments, life. To recount such good things as these, and to speak of them as
having no connection with God, the author of all good things, is to lose sight of the excellence
of the order in the things, and of the great evil of the error which leads to such a conclusion.</p>

<head>Chapter 30.—The Number of Good Things in Those Natures Which Manichæus
Places in the Region of Darkness.</head>
<p>33. "But," is the reply, "the orders of beings inhabiting those five natures were fierce
and destructive." As if I were praising their fierceness and destructiveness. I, you see, join
with you in condemning the evils you attribute to them; join you with me in praising the
good things which you ascribe to them: so it will appear that there is a mixture of good and
evil in what you call the last extremity of evil. If I join you in condemning what is mischievous
in this region, you must join with me in praising what is beneficial. For these beings
could not have been produced, or nourished, or have continued to inhabit that region,
without some salutary influence. I join with you in condemning the darkness; join with me
in praising the productiveness. For while you call the darkness immeasurable, you speak
of "suitable productions." Darkness, indeed, is not a real substance, and means no more
than the absence of light, as nakedness means the want of clothing, and emptiness the want
of material contents: so that darkness could produce nothing, although a region in darkness—
that is, in the absence of light—might produce something. But passing over this for
the present, it is certain that where productions arise there must be a beneficent adaptation
of substances, as well as a symmetrical arrangement and construction in unity of the members
of the beings produced,—a wise adjustment making them agree with one another. And
who will deny that all these things are more to be praised than darkness is to be condemned?
If I join with you in condemning the muddiness of the waters, you must join with me in
praising the waters as far as they possessed the form and quality of water, and also the
agreement of the members of the inhabitants swimming in the waters, their life sustaining
and directing their body, and every particular adaptation of substances for the benefit of
health. For though you find fault with the waters as turbid and muddy, still, in allowing
them the quality of producing and maintaining their living inhabitants, you imply that there
was some kind of bodily form, and similarity of parts, giving unity and congruity of character;
otherwise there could be no body at all: and, as a rational being, you must see that all these
things are to be praised. And however great you make the ferocity of these inhabitants, and
their massacrings and devastations in their assaults, you still leave them the regular limits
of form, by which the members of each body are made to agree together, and their beneficial
adaptations, and the regulating power of the living principle binding together the parts of
the body in a friendly and harmonious union. And if all these are regarded with common
sense it will be seen that they are more to be commended than the faults are to be condemned.
I join with you in condemning the frightfulness of the winds; join with me in
praising their nature, as giving breath and nourishment, and their material form in its continuousness
and diffusion by the connection of its parts: for by these things these winds
had the power of producing and nourishing, and sustaining in vigor these inhabitants you
speak of; and also in these inhabitants—besides the other things which have already been

<pb n="247"/>
commended in all animated creatures—this particular power of going quickly and easily
whence and whither they please, and the harmonious stroke of their wings in flight, and
their regular motion. I join with you in condemning the destructiveness of fire; join with
me in commending the productiveness of this fire, and the growth of these productions,
and the adaptation of the fire to the beings produced, so that they had coherence, and came
to perfection in measure and shape, and could live and have their abode there: for you see
that all these things deserve admiration and praise, not only in the fire which is thus habitable,
but in the inhabitants too. I join with you in condemning the denseness of smoke, and the
savage character of the prince who, as you say, abode in it; join with me in praising the
similarity of all the parts in this very smoke, by which it preserves the harmony and proportion
of its parts among themselves, according to its own nature, and has an unity which
makes it what it is: for no one can calmly reflect on these things without wonder and praise.
Besides, even to the smoke you give the power and energy of production, for you say that
princes inhabited it; so that in that region the smoke is productive, which never happens
here, and, moreover, affords a wholesome dwelling place to its inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="31">
<pb n="248"/>
<head>Chapter 31.—The Same Subject Continued.</head>
<p>34. And even in the prince of smoke himself, instead of mentioning only his ferocity
as a bad quality, ought you not to have taken notice of the other things in his nature which
you must allow to be commendable? For he had a soul and a body; the soul life-giving, and
the body endowed with life. Since the soul governed and the body obeyed, the soul took
the lead and the body followed; the soul gave consistency, the body was not dissolved; the
soul gave harmonious motion, and the body was constructed of a well-proportioned
framework of members. In this single prince are you not induced to express approval of
the orderly peace or the peaceful order? And what applies to one applies to all the rest. You
say he was fierce and cruel to others. This is not what I commend, but the other important
things which you will not take notice of. Those things, when perceived and considered,—after
advice by any one who has without consideration put faith in Manichæus,—lead him to a
clear conviction that, in speaking of those natures, he speaks of things good in a sense, not
perfect and un-created, like God the one Trinity, nor of the higher rank of created things,
like the holy angels and the ever-blessed powers; but of the lowest class, and ranked according
to the small measure of their endowments. These things are thought to be blameworthy by
the uninstructed when they compare them with higher things; and in view of their want of
some good, the good they have gets the name of evil, because it is defective. My reason also
for thus discussing the natures enumerated by Manichæus is that the things named are
things familiar to us in this world. We are familiar with darkness, waters, winds, fire, smoke;
we are familiar, too, with animals, creeping, swimming, flying; with quadrupeds and biped.
With the exception of darkness (which, as I have said already, is nothing but the absence of
light, and the perception of it is only the absence of sight, as the perception of silence is the
absence of hearing; not that darkness is anything, but that light is not, as neither that silence
is anything, but that sound is not), all the other things are natural qualities and are familiar
to all; and the form of those natures, which is commendable and good as far as it exists, no
wise man attributes to any other author than God, the author of all good things.284</p>
<note type="footnote">284 [This portion of the argument is conducted with great adroitness. Augustin takes the inhabitants of the
region of darkness, as Mani describes them, and proves that they possess so much of good that they can have

<pb n="249"/>
<head>Chapter 32.—Manichæus Got the Arrangement of His Fanciful Notions from Visible
Objects.</head>
<p>35. For in giving to these natures which he has learned from visible things, an arrange
ment according to his fanciful ideas, to represent the race of darkness, Manichæus is clearly
in error. First of all, he makes darkness productive, which is impossible. But, he replies,
this darkness was unlike what you are familiar with. How, then, can you make me understand
about it? After so many promises to give knowledge, will you force me to take your word
for it? Suppose I believe you, this at least is certain, that if the darkness had no form, as
darkness usually has not, it could produce nothing; if it had form, it was better than ordinary
darkness: whereas, when you call it different from the ordinary kind, you wish us to believe
that it is worse. You might as well say that silence, which is the same to the ear as darkness
to the eyes, produced some deaf or dumb animals in that region; and then, in reply to the
objection that silence is not a nature, you might say that it was different silence from ordinary
silence; in a word, you might say what you pleased to those whom you have once misled
into believing you. No doubt, the obvious facts relating to the origin of animal life led
Manichæus to say that serpents were produced in darkness. However, there are serpents
which have such sharp sight, and such pleasure in light, that they seem to give evidence of
the most weighty kind against this idea. Then the idea of swimming things in the water
might easily be got here, and applied to the fanciful objects in that region; and so of flying
things in the winds, for the motion of the lower air in this world, where birds fly, is called
wind. Where he got the idea of the quadrupeds in fire, no one can tell. Still he said this
deliberately, though without sufficient thought, and from great misconception. The reason
usually given is, that quadrupeds are voracious and salacious. But many men surpass any
quadruped in voracity, though they are bipeds, and are called children of the smoke, and
not of fire. Geese, too, are as voracious as any animal; and though he might place them in
fire as bipeds, or in the water because they love to swim, or in the winds because they have
wings and sometimes fly, they certainly have nothing to do with fire in this classification.
As regards salaciousness, I suppose he was thinking of neighing horses, which sometimes
bite through the bridle and rush at the mares; and writing hastily, with this in his mind, he
forgot the common sparrow, in comparison of which the hottest stallion is cold. The reason
they give for assigning bipeds to the smoke is, that bipeds are conceited and proud, for men
are derived from this class; and the idea, which is a plausible one, is that smoke resembles
proud people in rising up into the air, round and swelling. This idea might warrant a figurative
description of proud men, or an allegorical expression or explanation, but not the belief
that bipeds are born in smoke and of smoke. They might with equal reason be said to be
born in dust, for it often rises up to the heaven with a similar circling and lofty motion; or
in the clouds, for they are often drawn up from the earth in such a way, that those looking
from a distance are uncertain whether they are clouds or smoke. Once more, why, in the

<pb n="250"/>
case of the waters and the winds, does he suit the inhabitants to the character of the place,
as we see swimming things in water, and flying things in the wind; whereas, in the face of
fire and smoke, this bold liar is not ashamed to assign to these places the most unlikely inhabitants?
For fire burns quadrupeds, and consumes them, and smoke suffocates and kills
bipeds. At least he must acknowledge that he has made these natures better in the race of
darkness than they are here, though he wishes us to think everything to be worse. For, according
to this, the fire there produced and nourished quadrupeds, and gave them a lodging
not only harmless, but most convenient. The smoke, too, provided room for the offspring
of its own benign bosom, and cherished them up to the rank of prince. Thus we see that
these lies, which have added to the number of heretics, arose from the perception by carnal
sense, only without care or discernment, of visible objects in this world, and when thus
conceived, were brought forth by fancy, and then presumptuously written and published.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
<pb n="251"/>
<head>Chapter 33.—Every Nature, as Nature, is Good.</head>
<p>36. But the consideration we wish most to urge is the truth of the Catholic doctrine, if
they can understand it, that God is the author of all natures. I urged this before when I said,
I join with you in your condemnation of destructiveness, of blindness, of dense muddiness,
of terrific violence, of perishableness, of the ferocity of the princes, and so on; join with me
in commending form, classification, arrangement, harmony, unity of structure, symmetry
and correspondence of members, provision for vital breath and nourishment, wholesome
adaptation, regulation and control by the mind, and the subjection of the bodies, and the
assimilation and agreement of parts in the natures, both those inhabiting and those inhabited,
and all the other things of the same kind. From this, if they would only think honestly, they
would understand that it implies a mixture of good and evil, even in the region where they
suppose evil to be alone and in perfection: so that if the evils mentioned were taken away,
the good things will remain, without anything to detract from the commendation given to
them; whereas, if the good things are taken away, no nature is left. From this every one sees,
who can see, that every nature, as far as it is nature, is good; since in one and the same thing
in which I found something to praise, and he found something to blame, if the good things
are taken away, no nature will remain; but if the disagreeable things are taken away, the
nature will remain unimpaired. Take from waters their thickness and muddiness, and pure
clear water remains; take from them the consistence of their parts, and no water will be left.
If then, after the evil is removed, the nature remains in a purer state, and does not remain
at all when the good is taken away, it must be the good which makes the nature of the thing
in which it is, while the evil is not nature, but contrary to nature. Take from the winds their
terribleness and excessive force, with which you find fault, you can conceive of winds as
gentle and mild; take from them the similarity of their parts which gives them continuity
of substance, and the unity essential to material existence, and no nature remains to be
conceived of. It would be tedious to go through all the cases; but all who consider the subject
free from party spirit must see that in their list of natures the disagreeable things mentioned
are additions to the nature; and when they are removed, the natures remain better than before.
This shows that the natures, as far as they are natures, are good; for when you take
from them the good instead of the evil, no natures remain. And attend, you who wish to
arrive at a correct judgment, to what is said of the fierce prince himself. If you take away
his ferocity, see how many excellent things will remain; his material frame, the symmetry
of the members on one side with those on the other, the unity of his form, the settled continuity
of his parts, the orderly adjustment of the mind as ruling and animating, and the
body as subject and animated. The removal of these things, and of others I may have
omitted to mention, will leave no nature remaining.</p>

<pb n="252"/>
<head>Chapter 34.—Nature Cannot Be Without Some Good. The Manichæans Dwell
Upon the Evils.</head>
<p>37. But perhaps you will say that these evils cannot be removed from the natures, and
must therefore be considered natural. The question at present is not what can be taken
away, and what cannot; but it certainly helps to a clear perception that these natures, as far
as they are natures, are good, when we see that the good things can be thought of without
these evil things, while without these good things no nature can be conceived of. I can
conceive of waters without muddy commotion; but without settled continuity of parts no
material form is an object of thought or of sensation in any way. Therefore even these
muddy waters could not exist without the good which was the condition of their material
existence. As to the reply that these evil things cannot be taken from such natures, I rejoin
that neither can the good things be taken away. Why, then, should you call these things
natural evils, on account of the evil things which you suppose cannot be taken away, and
yet refuse to call them natural good things, on account of the good things which, as has been
proved, cannot be taken away?</p>
<p>38. You may next ask, as you usually do for a last resource, whence come these evils
which I have said that I too disapprove of. I shall perhaps tell you, if you first tell me whence
are those good things which you too are obliged to commend, if you would not be altogether
unreasonable. But why should I ask this, when we both acknowledge that all good things
whatever, and how great soever, are from the one God, who is supremely good? You must
therefore yourselves oppose Manichæus who has placed all these important good things
which we have mentioned and justly commended,—the continuity and agreement of parts
in each nature, the health and vigor of the animated creatures, and the other things which
it would be wearisome to repeat,—(in an imaginary region of darkness, so as to separate
them altogether from that God whom he allows to be the author of all good things.) He lost
sight of those good things, while taking notice only of what was disagreeable; as if one,
frightened by a lion’s roaring, and seeing him dragging away and tearing the bodies of cattle
or human beings which he had seized, should from childish pusillanimity be so overpowered
with fear as to see nothing but the cruelty and ferocity of the lion; and overlooking or disregarding
all the other qualities, should exclaim against the nature of this animal as not only
evil, but a great evil, his fear adding to his vehemence. But were he to see a tame lion, with
its ferocity subdued, especially if he had never been frightened by a lion, he would have
leisure, in the absence of danger and terror, to observe and admire the beauty of the animal.
My only remark on this is one closely connected with our subject: that any nature may be
in some case disagreeable, so as to excite hatred towards the whole nature; though it is clear
that the form of a real living beast, even when it excites terror in the woods, is far better than
that of the artificial imitation which is commended in a painting on the wall. We must not
then be misled into this error by Manichæus, or be hindered from observing the forms of

<pb n="253"/>
the natures, by his finding fault with some things in them in such a way as to make us disapprove
of them entirely, when it is impossible to show that they deserve entire disapproval.
And when our minds are thus composed and prepared to form a just judgment, we may
ask whence come those evils which I have said that I condemn. It will be easier to see this
if we class them all under one name.</p>

<head>Chapter 35.—Evil Alone is Corruption. Corruption is Not Nature, But Contrary to
Nature. Corruption Implies Previous Good.</head>
<p>39. For who can doubt that the whole of that which is called evil is nothing else than
corruption? Different evils may, indeed, be called by different names; but that which is the
evil of all things in which any evil is perceptible is corruption. So the corruption of an
educated mind is ignorance; the corruption of a prudent mind is imprudence; the corruption
of a just mind, injustice; the corruption of a brave mind, cowardice; the corruption of a
calm, peaceful mind, cupidity, fear, sorrow, pride. Again, in a living body, the corruption
of health is pain and disease; the corruption of strength is exhaustion; the corruption of rest
is toil. Again, in any corporeal thing, the corruption of beauty is ugliness; the corruption
of straightness is crookedness; the corruption of order is confusion; the corruption of entireness
is disseverance, or fracture, or diminution. It would be long and laborious to mention
by name all the corruptions of the things here mentioned, and of countless other things; for
in many cases the words may apply to the mind as well as to the body, and in innumerable
cases the corruption has a distinct name of its own. But enough has been said to show that
corruption does harm only as displacing the natural condition; and so, that corruption is
not nature, but against nature. And if corruption is the only evil to be found anywhere, and
if corruption is not nature, no nature is evil.</p>
<p>40. But if, perchance, you cannot follow this, consider again, that whatever is corrupted
is deprived of some good: for if it were not corrupted, it would be incorrupt; or if it could
not in any way be corrupted, it would be incorruptible. Now, if corruption is an evil, both
incorruption and incorruptibility must be good things. We are not, however, speaking at
present of incorruptible nature, but of things which admit of corruption, and which, while
not corrupted, may be called incorrupt, but not incorruptible. That alone can be called incorruptible
which not only is not corrupted, but also cannot in any part be corrupted.
Whatever things, then, being incorrupt, but liable to corruption, begin to be corrupted, are
deprived of the good which they had as incorrupt. Nor is this a slight good, for corruption
is a great evil. And the continued increase of corruption implies the continued presence of
good, of which they may be deprived. Accordingly, the natures supposed to exist in the region
of darkness must have been either corruptible or incorruptible. If they were incorruptible,
they were in possession of a good than which nothing is higher. If they were corruptible,
they were either corrupted or not corrupted. If they were not corrupted, they were incorrupt,
to say which of anything is to give it great praise. If they were corrupted, they were deprived
of this great good of incorruption; but the deprivation implies the previous possession of
the good they are deprived of; and if they possessed this good, they were not the perfection
of evil, and consequently all the Manichæan story is a falsehood.</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—The Source of Evil or of Corruption of Good.</head>
<p>41. After thus inquiring what evil is, and learning that it is not nature, but against nature,
we must next inquire whence it is. If Manichæus had done this, he might have escaped
falling into the snare of these serious errors. Out of time and out of order, he began with
inquiring into the origin of evil, without first asking what evil was; and so his inquiry led
him only to the reception of foolish fancies, of which the mind, much fed by the bodily
senses, with difficulty rids itself. Perhaps, then, some one, desiring no longer argument, but
delivery from error, will ask, Whence is this corruption which we find to be the common
evil of good things which are not incorruptible? Such an inquirer will soon find the answer
if he seeks for truth with great earnestness, and knocks reverently with sustained assiduity.
For while man can use words as a kind of sign for the expression of his thoughts, teaching
is the work of the incorruptible Truth itself, who is the one true, the one internal Teacher.
He became external also, that He might recall us from the external to the internal; and taking
on Himself the form of a servant, that He might bring down His height to the knowledge
of those rising up to Him, He condescended to appear in lowliness to the low. In His name
let us ask, and through Him let us seek mercy of the Father while making this inquiry. For
to answer in a word the question, Whence is corruption? it is hence, because these natures
that are capable of corruption were not begotten by God, but made by Him out of nothing;
and as we already proved that those natures are good, no one can say with propriety that
they were not good as made by God. If it is said that God made them perfectly good, it must
be remembered that the only perfect good is God Himself, the maker of those good things.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="37">
<pb n="256"/>
<head>Chapter 37.—God Alone Perfectly Good.</head>
<p>42. What harm, you ask, would follow if those things too were perfectly good? Still,
should any one, who admits and believes the perfect goodness of God the Father, inquire
what source we should reverently assign to any other perfectly good thing, supposing it to
exist, our only correct reply would be, that it is of God the Father, who is perfectly good.
And we must bear in mind that what is of Him is born of Him, and not made by Him out
of nothing, and that it is therefore perfectly, that is, incorruptibly, good like God Himself.
So we see that it is unreasonable to require that things made out of nothing should be as
perfectly good as He who was begotten of God Himself, and who is one as God is one, otherwise
God would have begotten something unlike Himself. Hence it shows ignorance and
impiety to seek for brethren for this only-begotten Son through whom all good things were
made by the Father out of nothing, except in this, that He condescended to appear as man.
Accordingly in Scripture He is called both only-begotten and first-begotten; only-begotten
of the Father, and first-begotten from the dead. "And we beheld," says John, "His glory, the
glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."285 And Paul says, "that
He might be the first-born among many brethren."286</p>
<p>43. But should we say, These things made out of nothing are not good things, but only
God’s nature is good, we shall be unjust to good things of great value. And there is impiety
in calling it a defect in anything not to be what God is, and in denying a thing to be good
because it is inferior to God. Pray submit then, thou nature of the rational soul, to be
somewhat less than God, but only so far less, that after Him nothing else is above thee.
Submit, I say, and yield to Him, lest He drive thee still lower into depths where the punishment
inflicted will continually detract more and more from the good which thou hast. Thou
exaltest thyself against God, if thou art indignant at His preceding thee; and thou art very
contumacious in thy thoughts of Him, if thou dost not rejoice unspeakably in the possession
of this good, that He alone is above thee. This being settled as certain, thou art not to say,
God should have made me the only nature: there should be no good thing after me. It could
not be that the next good thing to God should be the last. And in this is seen most clearly
how great dignity God conferred on thee, that He who in the order of nature alone rules
over thee, made other good things for thee to rule over. Nor be surprised that they are not
now in all respects subject to thee, and that sometimes they pain thee; for thy Lord has
greater authority over the things subject to thee than thou hast, as a master over the servants
of his servants. What wonder, then, if, when thou sinnest, that is, disobeyest thy Lord, the
things thou before ruledst over are made instrumental in thy punishment? For what is so
just, or what is more just than God? For this befell human nature in Adam, of whom this
<note type="footnote">285 John i. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">286 Rom. viii. 29.</note>

<pb n="257"/>
is not the place to speak. Suffice it to say, the righteous Ruler acts in character both in just
rewards and in just punishments, in the happiness of those who live rightly, and in the
penalty inflicted on sinners. Nor yet art thou287 left without mercy, since by an appointed
distribution of things and times thou art called to return. Thus the righteous control of the
supreme Creator extends even to earthly good things, which are corrupted and restored,
that thou mightest have consolations mingled with punishments; that thou mightest both
praise God when delighted by the order of good things, and mightest take refuge in Him
when tried by experience of evils. So, as far as earthly things are subject to thee, they teach
thee that thou art their ruler; as far as they distress thee, they teach thee to be subject to thy
Lord.</p>

<head>Chapter 38.—Nature Made by God; Corruption Comes from Nothing.</head>
<p>44. In this way, though corruption is an evil, and though it comes not from the Author
of natures, but from their being made out of nothing, still, in God’s government and control
over all that He has made, even corruption is so ordered that it hurts only the lowest natures,
for the punishment of the condemned, and for the trial and instruction of the returning,
that they may keep near to the incorruptible God, and remain incorrupt, which is our only
good; as is said by the prophet, "But it is good for me that I keep near to God."288 And you
must not say, God did not make corruptible natures: for, as far as they are natures, God
made them; but as far as they are corruptible, God did not make them: for corruption cannot
come from Him who alone is incorruptible. If you can receive this, give thanks to God; if
you cannot, be quiet and do not condemn what you do not yet understand, but humbly wait
on Him who is the light of the mind that thou mayest know. For in the expression "corruptible
nature" there are two words, and not one only. So, in the expression, God made out of
nothing, "God" and "nothing" are two separate words. Render therefore to each of these
words that which belongs to each, so that the word "nature" may go with the word "God,"and
the word "corruptible" with the word "nothing." And yet even the corruptions, though they
have not their origin from God, are to be overruled by Him in accordance with the order
of inanimate things and the deserts of His intelligent creatures. Thus we say rightly that
reward and punishment are both from God. For God’s not making corruption is consistent
with His giving over to corruption the man who deserves to be corrupted, that is, who has
begun to corrupt himself by sinning, that he who has wilfully yielded to the allurements of
corruption may, against his will, suffer its pains.</p>

<head>Chapter 39.—In What Sense Evils are from God.</head>
<p>45. Not only is it written in the Old Testament, "I make good, and create evil;"289 but
more clearly in the New Testament, where the Lord says, "Fear not them which kill the body,
and have no more that they can do; but fear him who, after he has killed the body, has power
to cast the soul into hell."290 And that to voluntary corruption penal corruption is added
in the divine judgment, is plainly declared by the Apostle Paul, when he says, "The temple
of God is holy, which temple ye are; whoever corrupts the temple of God, him will God
corrupt."291 If this had been said in the Old Law, how vehemently would the Manichæans
have denounced it as making God a corrupter! And from fear of the word, many Latin
translators make it, "him shall God destroy," instead of corrupt, avoiding the offensive word
without any change of meaning. Although these would inveigh against any passage in the
Old Law or the prophets if God was called in it a destroyer. But the Greek original here
shows that corrupt is the true word; for it is written distinctly, "Whoever corrupts the temple
of God, him will God corrupt." If the Manichæans are asked to explain the words, they will
say, to escape making God a corrupter, that corrupt here means to give over to corruption,
or some such explanation. Did they read the Old Law in this spirit, they would both find
many admirable things in it; and instead of spitefully attacking passages which they did not
understand, they would reverently postpone the inquiry.</p>

<head>Chapter 40.—Corruption Tends to Non-Existence.</head>
<p>46. But if any one does not believe that corruption comes from nothing, let him place
before himself existence and non-existence—one, as it were, on one side, and the other on
the other (to speak so as not to outstrip the slow to understand); then let him set something,
say the body of an animal, between them, and let him ask himself whether, while the body
is being formed and produced, while its size is increasing, while it gains nourishment, health,
strength, beauty, stability, it is tending, as regards its duration and permanence, to this side
or that, to existence or non-existence. He will see without difficulty, that even in the rudimentary
form there is an existence, and that the more the body is established and built up
in form, and figure and strength, the more does it come to exist, and to tend to the side of
existence. Then, again, let the body begin to be corrupted; let its whole condition be enfeebled,
let its vigor languish, its strength decay, its beauty be defaced, its framework be
sundered, the consistency of its parts give way and go to pieces; and let him ask now where
the body is tending in this corruption, whether to existence or non-existence: he will not
surely be so blind or stupid as to doubt how to answer himself, or as not to see that, in proportion
as anything is corrupted, in that proportion it approaches decease. But whatever
tends to decease tends to non-existence. Since, then, we must believe that God exists im-
mutably and incorruptibly, while what is called nothing is clearly altogether nonexistent;
and since, after setting before yourself existence and non-existence, you have observed that
the more a visible object increases the more it tends towards existence, while the more it is
corrupted the more it tends towards non-existence, why are you at a loss to tell regarding
any nature what in it is from God, and what from nothing; seeing that visible form is natural,
and corruption against nature? The increase of form leads to existence, and we acknowledge
God as supreme existence; the increase of corruption leads to non-existence, and we know
that what is non-existent is nothing. Why then, I say, are you at a loss to tell regarding a
corruptible nature, when you have both the words nature and corruptible, what is from
God, and what from nothing? And why do you inquire for a nature contrary to God, since,
if you confess that He is the supreme existence, it follows that non-existence is contrary to
Him?292</p>

<head>Chapter 41.—Corruption is by God’s Permission, and Comes from Us.</head>
<p>47. You ask, Why does corruption take from nature what God has given to it? It takes
nothing but where God permits; and He permits in righteous and well-ordered judgment,
according to the degrees of non-intelligent and the deserts of intelligent creatures. The
word uttered passes away as an object of sense, and perishes in silence; and yet the coming
and going of these passing words make our speech, and the regular intervals of silence give
pleasing and appropriate distinction; and so it is with temporal natures which have this
lowest form of beauty, that transition gives them being, and the death of what they give
birth to gives them individuality. And if our sense and memory could rightly take in the
order and proportions of this beauty, it would so please us, that we should not dare to give
the name of corruptions to those imperfections which give rise to the distinction. And when
distress comes to us through their peculiar beauty, by the loss of beloved temporal things
passing away, we both pay the penalty of our sins, and are exhorted to set our affection on
eternal things.</p>

<head>Chapter 42.—Exhortation to the Chief Good.</head>
<p>48. Let us, then, not seek in this beauty for what has not been given to it (and from not
having what we seek for, this is the lowest form of beauty); and in that which has been given
to it, let us praise God, because He has bestowed this great good of visible form even on the
lowest degree of beauty. And let us not cleave as lovers to this beauty, but as praisers of God
let us rise above it; and from this superior position let us pronounce judgment on it, instead
of so being bound up in it as to be judged along with it. And let us hasten on to that good
which has no motion in space or advancement in time, from which all natures in space and
time receive their sensible being and their form. To see this good let us purify our heart by
faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God."293 For the eyes needed in order to see this good are not those with which we see the
light spread through space, which has part in one place and part in another, instead of being
all in every place. The sight and the discernment we are to purify is that by which we see,
as far as is allowed in this life, what is just, what is pious, what is the beauty of wisdom. He
who sees these things, values them far above the fullness of all regions in space, and finds
that the vision of these things requires not the extension of his perception through distances
in space, but its invigoration by an immaterial influence.294</p>

which has been led by faith in its fancies to represent the divine substance as extended and
diffused through space, even through infinite space, and to cut short one side so as to make
room for evil,—not being able to perceive that evil is not nature, but against nature; and to
beautify this very evil with such visible appearance, and forms, and consistency of parts
prevailing in its several natures, not being able to conceive of any nature without those good
things, that the evils found fault with in it are buried under a countless abundance of good
things.</p>

<head>Reply to Faustus the Manichæan.</head>
<p><del>Contra Faustum Manichæum.</del> a.d. 400.</p>
<p>Written about the year 400. <del>Faustus was undoubtedly the acutest, most determined
and most unscrupulous opponent of orthodox Christianity in the age of Augustin. The
occasion of Augustin’s great writing against him was the publication of Faustus’ attack on
the Old Testament Scriptures, and on the New Testament so far as it was at variance with
Manichæan error. Faustus seems to have followed in the footsteps of Adimantus, against
whom Augustin had written some years before, but to have gone considerably beyond
Adimantus in the recklessness of his statements. The incarnation of Christ, involving his
birth from a woman, is one of the main points of attack. He makes the variations in the
genealogical records of the Gospels a ground for rejecting the whole as spurious. He supposed
the Gospels, in their present form, to be not the works of the Apostles, but rather of later
Judaizing falsifiers. The entire Old Testament system he treats with the utmost contempt,
blaspheming the Patriarchs, Moses, the Prophets, etc., on the ground of their private lives
and their teachings. Most of the objections to the morality of the Old Testament that are
now current were already familiarly used in the time of Augustin. Augustin’s answers are
only partially satisfactory, owing to his imperfect view of the relation of the old dispensation
to the new; but in the age in which they were written they were doubtless very effective.
The writing is interesting from the point of view of Biblical criticism, as well as from that
of polemics against Manichæism.—A.H.N.</del></p>

<pb n="266"/>
<head>Book I.</head>
<p>Who Faustus was. Faustus’s object in writing the polemical treatise that forms the basis of
Augustin’s reply. Augustin’s remarks thereon.</p>
<p>1. Faustus was an African by race, a citizen of Mileum; he was eloquent and clever, but
had adopted the shocking tenets of the Manichæan heresy. He is mentioned in my Confessions,
296 where there is an account of my acquaintance with him. This man published a
certain volume against the true Christian faith and the Catholic truth. A copy reached us,
and was read by the brethren, who called for an answer from me, as part of the service of
love which I owe to them. Now, therefore, in the name and with the help of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, I undertake the task, that all my readers may know that acuteness of
mind and elegance of style are of no use to a man unless the Lord directs his steps.297 In
the mysterious equity of divine mercy, God often bestows His help on the slow and the
feeble; while from the want of this help, the most acute and eloquent run into error only
with greater rapidity and willfulness. I will give the opinions of Faustus as if stated by
himself, and mine as if in reply to him.</p>
<p>2. Faustus said: As the learned Adimantus, the only teacher since the sainted Manichæus
deserving of our attention, has plentifully exposed and thoroughly refuted the errors of
Judaism and of semi-Christianity, I think it not amiss that you should be supplied in writing
with brief and pointed replies to the captious objections of our adversaries, that when, like
children of the wily serpent, they try to bewilder you with their quibbles, you may be prepared
to give intelligent answers. In this way they will be kept to the subject, instead of wandering
from one thing to another. And I have placed our opinions and those of our opponent over
against one another, as plainly and briefly as possible, so as not to perplex the reader with
a long and intricate discourse.</p>
<p>3. Augustin replies: You warn against semi-Christians, which you say we are; but we
warn against pseudo-Christians, which we have shown you to be. Semi-Christianity may
be imperfect without being false. So, then, if the faith of those whom you try to mislead is
imperfect, would it not be better to supply what is lacking than to rob them of what they
have? It was to imperfect Christians that the apostle wrote, "joying and beholding your
conversation," and "the deficiency in your faith in Christ."298 The apostle had in view a
spiritual structure, as he says elsewhere, "Ye are God’s building;"299 and in this structure he
found both a reason for joy and a reason for exertion. He rejoiced to see part already finished;

<note type="footnote">299 1 Cor. iii. 9.</note>

<pb n="267"/>
and the necessity of bringing the edifice to perfection called for exertion. Imperfect Christians
as we are, you pursue us with the desire to pervert what you call our semi-Christianity
by false doctrine; while even those who are so deficient in faith as to be unable to reply to
all your sophisms, are wise enough at least to know that they must not have anything at all
to do with you. You look for semi-Christians to deceive: we wish to prove you pseudo-
Christians, that Christians may learn something from your refutation, and that the less advanced
may learn to avoid you. Do you call us children of the serpent? You have surely
forgotten how often you have found fault with the prohibition in Paradise, and have praised
the serpent for opening Adam’s eyes. You have the better claim to the title which you give
us. The serpent owns you as well when you blame him as when you praise him.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="2">
<pb n="268"/>
<head>Book II.</head>
<p>Faustus claims to believe the Gospel, yet refuses to accept the genealogical tables on various
grounds which Augustin seeks to set aside.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Do I believe the gospel? Certainly. Do I therefore believe that Christ
was born? Certainly not. It does not follow that because I believe the gospel, as I do, I must
therefore believe that Christ was born. This I do not believe; because Christ does not say
that He was born of men, and the gospel, both in name and in fact, begins with Christ’s
preaching. As for the genealogy, the author himself does not venture to call it the gospel.
For what did he write? "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ the Son of David."300
The book of the generation is not the book of the gospel. It is more like a birth-register, the
star confirming the event. Mark, on the other hand, who recorded the preaching of the Son
of God, without any genealogy, begins most suitably with the words, "The gospel of Jesus
Christ the Son of God." It is plain that the genealogy is not the gospel. Matthew himself
says, that after John was put in prison, Jesus began to preach the gospel of the kingdom; so
that what is mentioned before this is the genealogy, and not the gospel. Why did not Matthew
begin with, "The gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God," but because he thought it sinful to
call the genealogy the gospel? Understand, then, what you have hitherto overlooked —the
distinction between the genealogy and the gospel. Do I then admit the truth of the gospel?
Yes; understanding by the gospel the preaching of Christ. I have plenty to say about the
generations too, if you wish. But you seem to me now to wish to know not whether I accept
the gospel, but whether I accept the generations.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: Well, in answer to your own questions, you tell us first that you
believe the gospel, and next, that you do not believe in the birth of Christ; and your reason
is, that the birth of Christ is not in the gospel. What, then, will you answer the apostle when
he says, "Remember that Christ Jesus rose from the dead, of the seed of David, according
to my gospel?"301 You surely are ignorant, or pretend to be ignorant, what the gospel is.
You use the word, not as the apostle teaches, but as suits your own errors. What the apostles
call the gospel you depart from; for you do not believe that Christ was of the seed of David.
This was Paul’s gospel; and it was also the gospel of the other apostles, and of all faithful
stewards of so great a mystery. For Paul says elsewhere, "Whether, therefore, I or they, so
we preach, and so ye believed."302 They did not all write the gospel, but they all preached
it. The name evangelist is properly given to the narrators of the birth, the actions, the words,
the sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ. The word gospel means good news, and might be

<note type="footnote">302 1 Cor. xv. 11.</note>

<pb n="269"/>
used of any good news, but is properly applied to the narrative of the Saviour. If, then, you
teach something different, you must have departed from the gospel. Assuredly those babes
whom you despise as semi-Christians will oppose you, when they hear their mother Charity
declaring by the mouth of the apostle, "If any one preach another gospel than that which
we have preached to you, let him be accursed."303 Since, then, Paul, according to his gospel,
preached that Christ was of the seed of David, and you deny this and preach something else,
may you be accursed! And what can you mean by saying that Christ never declares Himself
to have been born of men, when on every occasion He calls Himself the Son of man?</p>
<p>3. You learned men, forsooth, dress up for our benefit some wonderful First Man, who
came down from the race of light to war with the race of darkness, armed with his waters
against the waters of the enemy, and with his fire against their fire, and with his winds against
their winds. And why not with his smoke against their smoke, and with his darkness against
their darkness? According to you, he was armed against smoke with air, and against darkness
with light. So it appears that smoke and darkness are bad, since they could not belong to
his goodness. The other three, again—water, wind, and fire—are good. How, then, could
these belong to the evil of the enemy? You reply that the water of the race of darkness was
evil, while that which the First Man brought was good; and so, too, his good wind and fire
fought against the evil wind and fire of the adversary. But why could he not bring good
smoke against evil smoke? Your falsehoods seem to vanish in smoke. Well, your First Man
warred against an opposite nature. And yet only one of the five things he brought was the
opposite of what the hostile race had. The light was opposed to the darkness, but the four
others are not opposed to one another. Air is not the opposite of smoke, and still less is
water the opposite of water, or wind of wind, or fire of fire.</p>
<p>4. One is shocked at your wild fancies about this First Man changing the elements which
he brought, that he might conquer his enemies by pleasing them. So you make what you
call the kingdom of falsehood keep honestly to its own nature, while truth is changeable in
order to deceive. Jesus Christ, according to you, is the son of this First Man. Truth springs,
forsooth, from your fiction. You praise this First Man for using changeable and delusive
forms in the contest. If you, then, speak the truth, you do not imitate him. If you imitate
him, you deceive as he did. But our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the true and truthful
Son of God, the true and truthful Son of man, both of which He testifies of Himself, derived
the eternity of His godhead from true God, and His incarnation from true man. Your First
Man is not the first man of the apostle. "The first man," he says, "was of the earth, earthy;
the second man is from heaven, heavenly. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy;
as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. As we have borne the image of the
earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly."304 The first man of the earth, earthy, is
<note type="footnote">303 Gal. i. 8, 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">304 1 Cor. xv. 47-49.</note>

<pb n="270"/>
Adam, who was made of dust. The second man from heaven, heavenly, is the Lord Jesus
Christ; for, being the Son of God, He became flesh that He might be a man outwardly, while
He remained God within; that He might be both the true Son of God, by whom we were
made, and the true Son of man, by whom we are made anew. Why do you conjure up this
fabulous First Man of yours, and refuse to acknowledge the first man of the apostle? Is this
not a fulfillment of what the apostle says: "Turning away their ears from the truth, they will
give heed to fables?"305 According to Paul, the first man is of the earth, earthy; according
to Manichæus, he is not earthy, and is equipped with five elements of some unreal, unintel-
ligible kind. Paul says: "If any one should have announced to you differently from what we
have announced let him be accursed." Therefore lest Paul be a liar, let Manichæus be accursed.</p>
<p>5. Again, you find fault with the star by which the Magi were led to worship the infant
Christ, which you should be ashamed of doing, when you represent your fabulous Christ,
the son of your fabulous First Man not as announced by a star, but as bound up in all the
stars.306 For you say that he mingled with the principles of darkness in his conflict with the
race of darkness, that by capturing these principles the world might be made out of the
mixture. So that, by your profane fancies, Christ is not only mingled with heaven and all
the stars, but conjoined and compounded with the earth and all its productions,307—a Saviour
no more, but needing to be saved by you, by your eating and disgorging Him.</p>
<p>This foolish custom of making your disciples bring you food, that your teeth and
stomach may be the means of relieving Christ, who is bound up in it, is a consequence of
your profane fancies. You declare that Christ is liberated in this way—not, however, entirely;
for you hold that some tiny particles of no value still remain in the excrement, to be mixed
up and compounded again and again in various material forms, and to be released and
purified at any rate by the fire in which the world will be burned up, if not before. Nay,
even then, you say, Christ is not entirely liberated; but some extreme particles of His good
and divine nature, which have been so defiled that they cannot be cleansed, are condemned
to stay for ever in the horrid mass of darkness. And these people pretend to be offended
with our saying that a star announced the birth of the Son of God, as if this were placing
His birth under the influence of a constellation; while they subject Him not to stars only,

but to such polluting contact with all material things, with the juices of all vegetables, and
with the decay of all flesh, and with the decomposition of all food, in which He is bound
up, that the only way of releasing Him, at least one great means, is that men, that is the Elect
of the Manichæans, should succeed in digesting their dinner.</p>
<p>We, too, deny the influence of the stars upon the birth of any man; for we maintain that,
by the just law of God, the free-will of man, which chooses good or evil, is under no constraint
of necessity. How much less do we subject to any constellation the incarnation of the
eternal Creator and Lord of all! When Christ was born after the flesh, the star which the
Magi saw had no power as governing, but attended as a witness. Instead of assuming control
over Him, it acknowledged Him by the homage it did. Besides, this star was not one of
those which from the beginning of the world continue in the course ordained by the Creator.
Along with the new birth from the Virgin appeared a new star, which served as a guide to
the Magi who were themselves seeking for Christ; for it went before them till they reached
the place where they found the Word of God in the form of a child. But what astrologer
ever thought of making a star leave its course, and come down to the child that is born, as
they imagine, under it? They think that the stars affect the birth, not that the birth changes
the course of the stars; so, if the star in the Gospel was one of those heavenly bodies, how
could it determine Christ’s action, when it was compelled to change its own action at Christ’s
birth? But if, as is more likely, a star which did not exist before appeared to point out Christ,
it was the effect of Christ’s birth, and not the cause of it. Christ was not born because the
star was there; but the star was there because Christ was born. If there was any fate, it was
in the birth, and not in the star. The word fate is derived from a word which means to speak;
and since Christ is the Word of God by which all things were spoken before they were, the
conjunction of stars is not the fate of Christ, but Christ is the fate of the stars. The same
will that made the heavens took our earthly nature. The same power that ruled the stars
laid down His life and took it again.</p>
<p>6. Why, then, should the narrative of the birth not be the gospel, since it conveys such
good news as heals our malady? Is it because Matthew begins, not like Mark, with the words,
"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ," but, "The book of the generation of Jesus
Christ?" In this way, John, too, might be said not to have written the gospel, for he has not
the words, Beginning of the gospel, or Book of the gospel, but, "In the beginning was the
Word." Perhaps the clever word-maker Faustus will call the introduction in John a Verbidium,
as he called that in Matthew a Genesidium. The wonder is, that you are so impudent
as to give the name of gospel to your silly stories. What good news is there in telling us that,
in the conflict against some strange hostile nation, God could protect His own kingdom
only by sending part of His own nature into the greedy jaws of the former, and to be so defiled,
that after all those toils and tortures it cannot all be purged? Is this bad news the gospel?
Every one who has even a slender knowledge of Greek knows that gospel means good news.</p>

<pb n="272"/>
<p>But where is your good news, when your God himself is said to weep as under eclipse till
the darkness and defilement are removed from his members? And when he ceases to weep,
it seems he becomes cruel. For what has that part of him which is to be involved in the mass
done to deserve this condemnation? This part must go on weeping for ever. But no; whoever
examines this news will not weep because it is bad, but will laugh because it is not true.</p>

<head>Book III.</head>
<p>Faustus objects to the incarnation of God on the ground that the evangelists are at variance
with each other, and that incarnation is unsuitable to deity. Augustin attempts to remove
the critical and theological difficulties.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Do I believe in the incarnation? For my part, this is the very thing I
long tried to persuade myself of, that God was born; but the discrepancy in the genealogies
of Luke and Matthew stumbled me, as I knew not which to follow. For I thought it might
happen that, from not being omniscient, I might take the true for false, and the false for
true. So, in despair of settling this dispute, I betook myself to Mark and John, two authorities
still, and evangelists as much as the others. I approved with good reason of the beginning
of Mark and John, for they have nothing of David, or Mary, or Joseph. John says, "In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," meaning
Christ. Mark says, "The gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God," as if correcting Matthew,
who calls him the Son of David. Perhaps, however, the Jesus of Matthew is a different person
from the Jesus of Mark. This is my reason for not believing in the birth of Christ.</p>
<p>Remove this difficulty, if you can, by harmonizing the accounts, and I am ready to yield.
In any case, however, it is hardly consistent to believe that God, the God of Christians, was
born from the womb.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: Had you read the Gospel with care, and inquired into those places
where you found opposition, instead of rashly condemning them, you would have seen that
the recognition of the authority of the evangelists by so many learned men all over the world,
in spite of this most obvious discrepancy, proves that there is more in it than appears at first
sight. Any one can see, as well as you, that the ancestors of Christ in Matthew and Luke are
different; while Joseph appears in both, at the end in Matthew and at the beginning in Luke.
Joseph, it is plain, might be called the father of Christ, on account of his being in a certain
sense the husband of the mother of Christ; and so his name, as the male representative, appears
at the beginning or end of the genealogies. Any one can see as well as you that Joseph
has one father in Matthew and another in Luke, and so with the grandfather and with all
the rest up to David. Did all the able and learned men, not many Latin writers certainly,
but innumerable Greek, who have examined most attentively the sacred Scriptures, overlook
this manifest difference? Of course they saw it. No one can help seeing it. But with a due
regard to the high authority of Scripture, they believed that there was something here which
would be given to those that ask, and denied to those that snarl; would be found by those
that seek, and taken away from those that criticise; would be open to those that knock, and
shut against those that contradict. They asked, sought, and knocked; they received, found,
and entered in.</p>

<pb n="274"/>
<p>3. The whole question is how Joseph had two fathers. Supposing this possible, both
genealogies may be correct. With two fathers, why not two grandfathers, and two greatgrandfathers,
and so on, up to David, who was the father both of Solomon, who is mentioned
in Matthew’s list, and of Nathan, who occurs in Luke? This is the difficulty with many
people who think it impossible that two men should have one and the same son, forgetting
the very obvious fact that a man may be called the son of the person who adopted him as
well as of the person who begot him.</p>
<p>Adoption, we know, was familiar to the ancients; for even women adopted the children
of other women, as Sarah adopted Ishmael, and Leah her handmaid’s son, and Pharaoh’s
daughter Moses. Jacob, too, adopted his grandsons, the children of Joseph. Moreover, the
word adoption is of great importance in the system of our faith, as is seen from the
apostolic writings. For the Apostle Paul, speaking of the advantages of the Jews, says:
"Whose are the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law; whose
are the fathers, and of whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed
for ever."308 And again: "We ourselves also groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption
of the sons of God, even the redemption of the body."309 Again, elsewhere: "But in the
fullness of time, God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, that we might
receive the adoption of sons."310 These passages show clearly that adoption is a significant
symbol. God has an only Son, whom He begot from His own substance, of whom it is said,
"Being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal to God."311 Us He begot
not of His own substance, for we belong to the creation which is not begotten, but made;
but that He might make us the brothers of Christ, He adopted us. That act, then, by which
God, when we were not born of Him, but created and formed, begot us by His word and
grace, is called adoption. So John says, "He gave them power to become the sons of God."312</p>
<p>Since, therefore; the practice of adoption is common among our fathers, and in Scripture,
is there not irrational profanity in the hasty condemnation of the evangelists as false because
the genealogies are different, as if both could not be true, instead of considering calmly the
simple fact that frequently in human life one man may have two fathers, one of whose flesh
he is born, and another of whose will he is afterwards made a son by adoption? If the second
is not rightly called father, neither are we right in saying, "Our Father which art in heaven,"
to Him of whose substance we were not born, but of whose grace and most merciful will
we were adopted, according to apostolic doctrine, and truth most sure. For one is to us

<pb n="275"/>
God, and Lord, and Father: God, for by Him we are created, though of human parents;
Lord, for we are His subjects; Father, for by His adoption we are born again. Careful students
of sacred Scripture easily saw, from a little consideration, how, in the different genealogies
of the two evangelists, Joseph had two fathers, and consequently two lists of ancestors. You
might have seen this too, if you had not been blinded by the love of contradiction. Other
things far beyond your understanding have been discovered in the careful investigation of
all parts of these narratives. The familiar occurrence of one man begetting a son and another
adopting him, so that one man has two fathers, you might, in spite of Manichæan error,
have thought of as an explanation, if you had not been reading in a hostile spirit.</p>
<p>4. But why Matthew begins with Abraham and descends to Joseph, while Luke begins
with Joseph and ascends, not to Abraham, but to God, who made man, and, by giving a
commandment, gave him power to become, by believing, a son of God; and why Matthew
records the generations at the commencement of his book, Luke after the baptism of the
Saviour by John; and what is the meaning of the number of the generations in Matthew,
who divides them into three sections of fourteen each, though in the whole sum there appears
to be one wanting; while in Luke the number of generations recorded after the baptism
amount to seventy-seven, which number the Lord Himself enjoins in connection with the
forgiveness of sins, saying, "Not only seven times, but seventy-seven times;"—these things
you will never understand, unless either you are taught by some Catholic of superior stamp,
who has studied the sacred Scriptures, and has made all the progress possible, or you
yourselves turn from your error, and in a Christian spirit ask that you may receive, seek that
you may find, and knock that it may be opened to you.</p>
<p>5. Since, then, this double fatherhood of nature and adoption removes the difficulty
arising from the discrepancy of the genealogies, there is no occasion for Faustus to leave the
two evangelists and betake himself to the other two, which would be a greater affront to
those he betook himself to than to those he left. For the sacred writers do not desire to be
favored at the expense of their brethren. For their joy is in union, and they are one in Christ;
and if one says one thing, and another another, or one in one way and another in another,
still they all speak truth, and in no way contradict one another; only let the reader be reverent
and humble, not in an heretical spirit seeking occasion for strife, but with a believing heart
desiring edification. Now, in this opinion that the evangelists give the ancestors of different
fathers, as it is quite possible for a man to have two fathers, there is nothing inconsistent
with truth. So the evangelists are harmonized, and you, by Faustus’s promise are bound to
yield at once.</p>
<p>6. You may perhaps be troubled by that additional remark which he makes: "In any
case, however, it is hardly consistent to believe that God, the God of Christians, was born
from the womb." As if we believed that the divine nature came from the womb of a woman.
Have I not just quoted the testimony of the apostle, speaking of the Jews: "Whose are the

<pb n="276"/>
fathers, and of whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is God over all, blessed for
ever?" Christ, therefore, our Lord and Saviour, true Son of God in His divinity, and true
son of man according to the flesh, not as He is God over all was born of a woman, but in
that feeble nature which He took of us, that in it He might die for us, and heal it in us: not
as in the form of God, in which He thought it not robbery to be equal to God, was He born
of a woman, but in the form of a servant, in taking which He emptied Himself. He is
therefore said to have emptied Himself because He took the form of a servant, not because
He lost the form of God. For in the unchangeable possession of that nature by which in the
form of God He is equal to the Father, He took our changeable nature, by which He might
be born of a virgin. You, while you protest against putting the flesh of Christ in a virgin’s
womb, place the very divinity of God in the womb not only of human beings, but of dogs
and swine. You refuse to believe that the flesh of Christ was conceived in the Virgin’s womb,
in which God was not found nor even changed; while you assert that in all men and beasts,
in the seed of male and in the womb of female, in all conceptions on land or in water, an
actual part of God and the divine nature is continually bound, and shut up, and contaminated,
never to be wholly set free.313</p>

<head>Book IV.</head>
<p>Faustus’s reasons for rejecting the Old Testament, and Augustin’s animadversions thereon.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Do I believe the Old Testament? If it bequeaths anything to me, I believe
it; if not, I reject it. It would be an excess of forwardness to take the documents of others
which pronounce me disinherited. Remember that the promise of Canaan in the Old
Testament is made to Jews, that is, to the circumcised, who offer sacrifice, and abstain from
swine’s flesh, and from the other animals which Moses pronounces unclean, and observe
Sabbaths, and the feast of unleavened bread, and other things of the same kind which the
author of the Testament enjoined. Christians have not adopted these observances, and no
one keeps them; so that if we will not take the inheritance, we should surrender the documents.
This is my first reason for rejecting the Old Testament, unless you teach me better.
My second reason is, that this inheritance is such a poor fleshly thing, without any spiritual
blessings, that after the New Testament, and its glorious promise of the kingdom of heaven
and eternal life, I think it not worth the taking.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: No one doubts that promises of temporal things are contained in
the Old Testament, for which reason it is called the Old Testament; or that the kingdom of
heaven and the promise of eternal life belong to the New Testament. But that in these
temporal things were figures of future things which should be fulfilled in us upon whom
the ends of the ages are come, is not my fancy, but the judgment of the apostle, when he
says of such things, "These things were our examples;" and again, "These things happened
to them for an example, and they are written for us on whom the ends of the ages are
come."314 We receive the Old Testament, therefore, not in order to obtain the fulfillment
of these promises, but to see in them predictions of the New Testament; for the Old bears
witness to the New. Whence the Lord, after He rose from the dead, and allowed His disciples
not only to see but to handle Him, still, lest they should doubt their mortal and fleshly senses,
gave them further confirmation from the testimony of the ancient books, saying, "It was
necessary that all things should be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in
the Prophets and Psalms, concerning me."315 Our hope, therefore, rests not on the promise
of temporal things. Nor do we believe that the holy and spiritual men of these times—the
patriarchs and prophets—were taken up with earthly things. For they understood, by the
revelation of the Spirit of God, what was suitable for that time, and how God appointed all
these sayings and actions as types and predictions of the future. Their great desire was for
the New Testament; but they had a personal duty to perform in those predictions, by which
the new things of the future were foretold. So the life as well as the tongue of these men was

<pb n="278"/>
Faustus’s reasons for rejecting the Old Testament, and Augustin’s animadversions…
prophetic. The carnal people, indeed, thought only of present blessings, though even in
connection with the people there were prophecies of the future.</p>
<p>These things you do not understand, because, as the prophet said, "Unless you believe,
you shall not understand."316 For you are not instructed in the kingdom of heaven,—that
is, in the true Catholic Church of Christ. If you were, you would bring forth from the
treasure of the sacred Scriptures things old as well as new. For the Lord Himself says,
"Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like an householder who
brings forth from his treasure things new and old."317 And so, while you profess to receive
only the new promises of God, you have retained the oldness of the flesh, adding only the
novelty of error; of which novelty the apostle says, "Shun profane novelties of words, for
they increase unto more ungodliness, and their speech eats like a cancer. Of whom is Hymenæus
and Philetus, who concerning the faith have erred, saying that the resurrection is
past already, and have overthrown the faith of some." 318 Here you see the source of your
false doctrine, in teaching that the resurrection is only of souls by the preaching of the truth,
and that there will be no resurrection of the body. But how can you understand spiritual
things of the inner man, who is renewed in the knowledge of God, when in the oldness of
the flesh, if you do not possess temporal things, you concoct fanciful notions about them
in those images of carnal things of which the whole of your false doctrine consists? You
boast of despising as worthless the land of Canaan, which was an actual thing, and actually
given to the Jews; and yet you tell of a land of light cut asunder on one side, as by a narrow
wedge, by the land of the race of darkness,—a thing which does not exist, and which you
believe from the delusion of your minds; so that your life is not supported by having it, and
your mind is wasted in desiring it.319</p>

<p>Faustus claims that the Manichæans and not the Catholics are consistent believers in the
Gospel, and seeks to establish this claim by comparing Manichæan and Catholic obedience
to the precepts of the Gospel. Augustin exposes the hypocrisy of the Manichæans and
praises the asceticism of Catholics.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Do I believe the gospel? You ask me if I believe it, though my obedience
to its commands shows that I do. I should rather ask you if you believe it, since you give
no proof of your belief. I have left my father, mother, wife, and children, and all else that
the gospel requires;320 and do you ask if I believe the gospel? Perhaps you do not know
what is called the gospel. The gospel is nothing else than the preaching and the precept of
Christ. I have parted with all gold and silver, and have left off carrying money in my purse;
content with daily food; without anxiety for tomorrow; and without solicitude about how
I shall be fed, or where-withal I shall be clothed: and do you ask if I believe the gospel? You
see in me the blessings of the gospel; 321 and do you ask if I believe the gospel? You see me
poor, meek, a peacemaker, pure in heart, mourning, hungering, thirsting, bearing persecutions
and enmity for righteousness’ sake; and do you doubt my belief in the gospel? One
can understand now how John the Baptist, after seeing Jesus, and also hearing of His works,
yet asked whether He was Christ. Jesus properly and justly did not deign to reply that He
was; but reminded him of the works of which he had already heard: "The blind see, the deaf
hear, the dead are raised."322 In the same way, I might very well reply to your question
whether I believe the gospel, by saying, I have left all, father, mother, wife, children, gold,
silver, eating, drinking, luxuries, pleasures; take this as a sufficient answer to your questions,
and believe that you will be blessed if you are not offended in me.323</p>
<p>2. But, according to you, to believe the gospel is not only to obey its commands, but
also to believe in all that is written in it; and, first of all, that God was born. But neither is
believing the gospel only to believe that Jesus was born, but also to do what He commands.
So, if you say that I do not believe the gospel because I disbelieve the incarnation, much
more do you not believe because you disregard the commandments. At any rate, we are on
a par till these questions are settled. If your disregard of the precepts does not prevent you
from professing faith in the gospel, why should my rejection of the genealogy prevent me?
And if, as you say, to believe the gospel includes both faith in the genealogies and obedience

<pb n="280"/>
to the precepts, why do you condemn me, since we both are imperfect? What one wants
the other has. But if, as there can be no doubt, belief in the gospel consists solely in obedience
to the commands of God, your sin is twofold. As the proverb says, the deserter accuses the
soldier. But suppose, since you will have it so, that there are these two parts of perfect faith,
one consisting in word, or the confession that Christ was born, the other in deed or the observance
of the precepts; it is plain that my part is hard and painful, yours light and easy.
It is natural that the multitude should flock to you and away from me, for they know not
that the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. Why, then, do you blame me for
taking the harder part, and leaving to you, as to a weak brother, the easy part? You have
the idea that your part of faith, or confessing that Christ was born, has more power to save
the soul than the other parts.</p>
<p>3. Let us then ask Christ Himself, and learn from His own mouth, what is the chief
means of our salvation. Who shall enter, O Christ, into Thy kingdom? He that doeth the
will of my Father in heaven,324 is His reply; not, "He that confesses that I was born." And
again, He says to His disciples, "Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things which I
have commanded you."325 It is not, "teaching them that I was born," but, "to observe my
commandments." Again, "Ye are my friends if ye do what I command you;"326 not, "if you
believe that I was born." Again, "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love,"327
and in many other places. Also in the sermon on the mount, when He taught, "Blessed are
the poor, blessed are the meek, blessed are the peacemakers, blessed are the pure in heart,
blessed are they that mourn, blessed are they that hunger, blessed are they that are persecuted
for righteousness’ sake,"328 He nowhere says, "Blessed are they that confess that I was born."
And in the separation of the sheep from the goats in the judgment, He says that He will say
to them on the right hand, "I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave
me drink,"329 and so on; therefore "inherit the kingdom." Not, "Because ye believe that I
was born, inherit the kingdom." Again, to the rich man seeking for eternal life, He says,
"Go, sell all that thou hast, and follow me;"330 not, "Believe that I was born, that you may
have eternal life." You see, the kingdom, life, happiness, are everywhere promised to the
part I have chosen of what you call the two parts of faith, and nowhere to your part. Show,

if you can, a place where it is written that whoso confesses that Christ was born of a woman
is blessed, or shall inherit the kingdom, or have eternal life. Even supposing, then, that there
are two parts of faith, your part has no blessing. But what if we prove that your part is not
a part of faith at all? It will follow that you are foolish, which indeed will be proved beyond
a doubt. At present, it is enough to have shown that our part is crowned with the beatitudes.
Besides, we have also a beatitude for a confession in words: for we confess that Jesus Christ
is the Son of the living God; and Jesus declares with His own lips that this confession has a
benediction, when He says to Peter, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood
hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."331 So that we have not
one, but both these parts of faith, and in both alike are we pronounced blessed by Christ;
for in one we reduce faith to practice, while in the other our confession is unmixed with
blasphemy.</p>
<p>4. Augustin replied: I have already said that the Lord Jesus Christ repeatedly calls
Himself the Son of man, and that the Manichæans have contrived a silly story about some
fabulous First Man, who figures in their impious heresy, not earthly, but combined with
spurious elements, in opposition to the apostle, who says, "The first man is of the earth,
earthy;"332 and that the apostle carefully warns us, "If any one preaches to you differently
from what we have preached, let him be accursed."333 So that we must believe Christ to be
the Son of man according to apostolic truth, not according to Manichæan error. And since
the evangelists assert that Christ was born of a woman, of the seed of David, and Paul writing
to Timothy says, "Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the
dead, according to my gospel,"334 it is clear what sense we must believe Christ to be the Son
of man; for being the Son of God by whom we were made, He also by His incarnation became
the Son of man, that He might die for our sins, and rise again for our justification.335 Accordingly
He calls Himself both Son of God and Son of man. To take only one instance out
of many, in the Gospel of John it is written, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh,
and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall
live. For as the Father hath life in Himself, so He hath given to the Son to have life in
Himself; and hath given Him power to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of
man." 336 He says, "They shall hear the voice of the Son of God;" and He says, "because He
is the Son of man." As the Son of man, He has received power to execute judgment, because

<pb n="282"/>
He will come to judgment in human form, that He may be seen by the good and the wicked.
In this form He ascended into heaven, and that voice was heard by His disciples, "He shall
so come as ye have seen Him go into heaven."337 As the Son of God, as God equal to and
one with the Father, He will not be seen by the wicked; for "blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God." Since, then, He promises eternal life to those that believe in Him,
and since to believe in Him is to believe in the true Christ, such as He declares Himself and
His apostles declare Him to be, true Son of God and true Son of man; you, Manichæans,
who believe on a false and spurious son of a false and spurious man, and teach that God
Himself, from fear of the assault of the hostile race, gave up His own members to be tortured,
and after all not to be wholly liberated, are plainly far from that eternal life which Christ
promises to those who believe in Him. It is true, He said to Peter when he confessed Him
to be the Son of God, "Blessed art thou, Simon. Barjona." But does He promise nothing to
those who believe Him to be the Son of man, when the Son of God and the Son of man are
the same? Besides, eternal life is expressly promised to those who believe in the Son of man.
"As Moses," He says, "lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted
up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."338 What more
do you wish? Believe then in the Son of man, that you may have eternal life; for He is also
the Son of God, who can give eternal life: for He is "the true God and eternal life," as the
same John says in his epistle. John also adds, that he is antichrist who denies that Christ
has come in the flesh.339</p>
<p>5. There is no need, then that you should extol so much the perfection of Christ’s
commands, because you obey the precepts of the gospel. For the precepts, supposing you
really to fulfill them, would not profit you without true faith. Do you not know that the
apostle says, "If I distribute all my goods to the poor, and give my body to be burned, and
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing?"340 Why do you boast of having Christian poverty,
when you are destitute of Christian charity? Robbers have a kind of charity to one another,
arising from a mutual consciousness of guilt and crime; but this is not the charity commended
by the apostle. In another passage he distinguishes true charity from all base and vicious
affections, by saying, "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
a good conscience, and faith unfeigned." 341 How then can you have true charity from a
fictitious faith?342 You persist in a faith corrupted by falsehood: for your First Man, accord-

ing to you, used deceit in the conflict by changing his form, while his enemies remained in
their own nature; and, besides, you maintain that Christ, who says, "I am the truth," feigned
His incarnation, His death on the cross, the wounds of His passion, the marks shown after
His resurrection. If you speak the truth, and your Christ speaks falsehood, you must be
better than he. But if you really follow your own Christ, your truthfulness may be doubted,
and your obedience to the precepts you speak of may be only a pretence. Is it true, as
Faustus says, that you have no money in your purses? He means, probably, that your money
is in boxes and bags; nor would we blame you for this, if you did not profess one thing and
practise another. Constantius, who is still alive, and is now our brother in Catholic Christianity,
once gathered many of your sect into his house at Rome, to keep these precepts of
Manichæus, which you think so much of, though they are very silly and childish. The precepts
proved too much for your weakness, and the gathering was entirely broken up. Those
who persevered separated from your communion, and are called Mattarians, because they
sleep on mats,—a very different bed from the feathers of Faustus and his goatskin coverlets,
and all the grandeur that made him despise not only the Mattarians, but also the house of
his poor father in Mileum. Away, then, with this accursed hypocrisy from your writing, if
not from your conduct; or else your language will conflict with your life by your deceitful
words, as your First Man with the race of darkness by his deceitful elements.</p>
<p>6. I am, however, addressing not merely men who fail to do what they are commanded,
but the members of a deluded sect. For the precepts of Manichæus are such that, if you do
not keep them, you are deceivers; if you do keep them, you are deceived. Christ never taught
you that you should not pluck a vegetable for fear of committing homicide; for when His
disciples were hungry when passing through a field of corn, He did not forbid them to pluck
the ears on the Sabbath-day; which was a rebuke to the Jews of the time since the action was
on Sabbath; and a rebuke in the action itself to the future Manichæans. The precept of
Manichæus, however, only requires you to do nothing while others commit homicide for
you; though the real homicide is that of ruining miserable souls by such doctrines of devils.</p>
<p>7. The language of Faustus has the typhus of heresy in it, and is the language of overweening
arrogance. "You see in me" he says, "the beatitudes of the gospel; and do you ask
if I believe the gospel? You see me poor, meek, a peacemaker, pure in heart, mourning,
hungering, thirsting, bearing persecution and enmity for righteousness’ sake; and do you
doubt my belief in the gospel?" If to justify oneself were to be just, Faustus would have flown
to heaven while uttering these words. I say nothing of the luxurious habits of Faustus,
known to all the followers of the Manichæans, and especially to those at Rome. I shall
suppose a Manichæan such as Constantius sought for, when he enforced the observance of
these precepts with the sincere desire to see them observed. How can I see him to be poor
in spirit, when he is so proud as to believe that his own soul is God, and is not ashamed to
speak of God as in bondage? How can I see him meek, when he affronts all the authority

<pb n="284"/>
of the evangelists rather than believe? How a peacemaker, when he holds that the divine
nature itself by which God is whatever is, and is the only true existence, could not remain
in lasting peace? How pure in heart, when his heart is filled with so many impious notions?
How mourning, unless it is for his God captive and bound till he be freed and escape, with
the loss, however, of a part which is to be united by the Father to the mass of darkness, and
is not to be mourned for? How hungering and thirsting for righteousness, which Faustus
omits in his writings lest, no doubt, he should be thought destitute of righteousness? But
how can they hunger and thirst after righteousness, whose perfect righteousness will consist
in exulting over their brethren condemned to darkness, not for any fault of their own, but
for being irremediably contaminated by the pollution against which they were sent by the
Father to contend?</p>
<p>8. How do you suffer persecution and enmity for righteousness’ sake, when, according
to you, it is righteous to preach and teach these impieties? The wonder is, that the gentleness
of Christian times allows such perverse iniquity to pass wholly or almost unpunished. And
yet, as if we were blind or silly, you tell us that your suffering reproach and persecution is
a great proof of your righteousness. If people are just according to the amount of their
suffering, atrocious criminals of all kinds suffer much more than you. But, at any rate, if
we are to grant that suffering endured on account of any sort of profession of Christianity
proves the sufferer to be in possession of true faith and righteousness, you must admit that
any case of greater suffering that we can show proves the possession of truer faith and
greater righteousness. Of such cases you know many among our martyrs, and chiefly Cyprian
himself, whose writings also bear witness to his belief that Christ was born of the Virgin
Mary. For this faith, which you abhor, he suffered and died along with many Christian believers
of that day, who suffered as much, or more. Faustus, when shown to be a Manichæan
by evidence, or by his own confession, on the intercession of the Christians themselves, who
brought him before the proconsul, was, along with some others, only banished to an island,
which can hardly be called a punishment at all, for it is what God’s servants do of their own
accord every day when they wish to retire from the tumult of the world. Besides, earthly
sovereigns often by a public decree give release from this banishment as an act of mercy.
And in this way all were afterwards released at once. Confess, then, that they were in possession
of a truer faith and a more righteous life, who were accounted worthy to suffer for
it much more than you ever suffered. Or else, cease boasting of the abhorrence which many
feel for you, and learn to distinguish between suffering for blasphemy and suffering for
righteousness. What it is you suffer for, your own books will show in a way that deserves
your most particular attention.</p>
<p>9. Those evangelical precepts of peculiar sublimity which you make people who know
no better believe that you obey, are really obeyed by multitudes in our communion. Are
there not among us many of both sexes who have entirely refrained from sexual intercourse,

<pb n="285"/>
and many formerly married who practise continence? Are there not many others who give
largely of their property, or give it up altogether, and many who keep the body in subjection
by fasts, either frequent or daily, or protracted beyond belief? Then there are fraternities
whose members have no property of their own, but all things common, including only things
necessary for food and clothing, living with one soul and one heart towards God, inflamed
with a common feeling of charity. In all such professions many turn out to be deceivers
and reprobates, while many who are so are never discovered; many, too, who at first walk
well, fall away rapidly from willfulness. Many are found in times of trial to have adopted
this kind of life with another intention than they professed; and again, many in humility
and steadfastness persevere in their course to the end, and are saved. There are apparent
diversities in these societies; but one charity unites all who, from some necessity, in obedience
to the apostle’s injunction, have their wives as if they had them not, and buy as if they bought
not, and use this world as if they used it not. With these are joined, in the abundant riches
of God’s mercy, the inferior class of those to whom it is said, "Defraud not one another, except
it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to prayer; and come together again,
that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. But I speak this by permission, and not of
commandment."343 To such the same apostle also says, "Now therefore there is utterly a
fault among you, that ye go to law one with another;" while, in consideration of their infirmity,
he adds, "If ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who
are least esteemed in the Church."344 For in the kingdom of heaven there are not only those
who, that they may be perfect, sell or leave all they have and follow the Lord; but others in
the partnership of charity are joined like a mercenary force to the Christian army, to whom
it will be said at last, "I was hungry, and ye gave me meat," and so on. Otherwise, there
would be no salvation for those to whom the apostle gives so many anxious and particular
directions about their families, telling the wives to be obedient to their husbands, and husbands
to love their wives; children to obey their parents, and parents to bring up their children
in the instruction and admonition of the Lord; servants to obey with fear their masters according
to the flesh, and masters to render to their servants what is just and equal. The
apostle is far from condemning such people as regardless of gospel precepts, or unworthy
of eternal life. For where the Lord exhorts the strong to attain perfection, saying, "If any
man take not up his cross and follow me, he cannot be my disciple," He immediately adds,
for the consolation of the weak, "Whoso receiveth a just man in the name of a just man shall
receive a just man’s reward; and whoso receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall
receive a prophet’s reward." So that not only he who gives Timothy a little wine for his
<note type="footnote">343 1 Cor. vii. 5, 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">344 1 Cor. vi. 7, 4.</note>

<pb n="286"/>
stomach’s sake, and his frequent infirmities, but he who gives to a strong man a cup of cold
water only in the name of a disciple, shall not lose his reward.345</p>
<p>10. If it is true that a man cannot receive the gospel without giving up everything, why
do you delude your followers, by allowing them to keep in your service their wives, and
children, and households, and houses, and fields? Indeed, you may well allow them to disregard
the precepts of the gospel: for all you promise them is not a resurrection, but a change
to another mortal existence, in which they shall live the silly, childish, impious life of those
you call the Elect, the life you live yourself, and are so much praised for; or if they possess
greater merit, they shall enter into melons or cucumbers, or some eatables which you will
masticate, that they may be quickly purified by your digestion. Least of all should you who
teach such doctrines profess any regard for the gospel. For if the faith of the gospel had any
connection with such nonsense, the Lord should have said, not, "I was hungry, and ye gave
me meat;" but, "Ye were hungry, and ye ate me," or, "I was hungry, and I ate you." For, by
your absurdities, a man will not be received into the kingdom of God for the service of giving
food to the saints, but, because he has eaten them and belched them out, or has himself been
eaten and belched into heaven. Instead of saying, "Lord, when saw we Thee hungry, and
fed Thee?" the righteous must say, "When saw we Thee hungry, and were eaten by Thee?"
And He must answer, not, "When ye gave food to one of the least of these my brethren, you
gave to me;" but, "When you were eaten by one of the least of these my brethren, you were
eaten by me."</p>
<p>11. Believing and teaching such monstrosities, and living accordingly, you yet have the
boldness to say that you obey the precepts of the gospel, and to decry the Catholic Church,
which includes many weak as well as strong, both of whom the Lord blesses, because both
according to their measure obey the precepts of the gospel and hope in its promises. The
blindness of hostility makes you see only the tares in our harvest: for you might easily see
wheat too, if you were willing that there should be any. But among you, those who are
pretended Manichæans are wicked, and those who are really Manichæans are silly. For
where the faith itself is false, he who hypocritically professes it acts deceitfully, while he who
truly believes is deceived. Such a faith cannot produce a good life, for every man’s life is
good or bad according as his heart is engaged. If your affections were set upon spiritual
and intellectual good, instead of material forms, you would not pay homage to the material
sun as a divine substance, and as the light of wisdom, which every one knows you do, though
I now only mention it in passing.</p>

<head>Book VI.</head>
<p>Faustus avows his disbelief in the Old Testament and his disregard of its precepts, and accuses
Catholics of inconsistency in neglecting its ordinances, while claiming to accept it as authoritative.
Augustin explains the Catholic view of the relation of the Old Testament to
the New.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You ask if I believe the Old Testament. Of course not, for I do not
keep its precepts. Neither, I imagine, do you. I reject circumcision as disgusting; and if I
mistake not, so do you. I reject the observance of Sabbaths as superfluous: I suppose you
do the same. I reject sacrifice as idolatry, as doubtless you also do. Swine’s flesh is not the
only flesh I abstain from; nor is it the only flesh you eat. I think all flesh unclean: you think
none unclean. Both alike, in these opinions, throw over the Old Testament. We both look
upon the weeks of unleavened bread and the feast of tabernacles as unnecessary and useless.
Not to patch linen garments with purple; to count it adultery to make a garment of linen
and wool; to call it sacrilege to yoke together an ox and an ass when necessary; not to appoint
as priest a bald man, or a man with red hair, or any similar peculiarity, as being unclean in
the sight of God, are things which we both despise and laugh at, and rank as of neither first
nor second importance; and yet they are all precepts and judgments of the Old Testament.
You cannot blame me for rejecting the Old Testament; for whether it is right or wrong to
do so, you do it as much as I. As for the difference between your faith and mine, it is this,
that while you choose to act deceitfully, and meanly to praise in words what in your heart
you hate, I, not having learned the art of deception, frankly declare that I hate both these
abominable precepts and their authors.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: How and for what purpose the Old Testament is received by the
heirs of the New Testament has been already explained.346 But as the remarks of Faustus
were then about the promises of the Old Testament, and now he speaks of the precepts, I
reply that he displays ignorance of the difference between moral and symbolical precepts.
For example, "Thou shalt not covet" is a moral precept; "Thou shalt circumcise every male
on the eighth day" is a symbolical precept. From not making this distinction, the
Manichæans, and all who find fault with the writings of the Old Testament, not seeing that
whatever observance God appointed for the former dispensation was a shadow of future
things, because these observances are now discontinued, condemn them, though no doubt
what is unsuitable now was perfectly suitable then as prefiguring the things now revealed.
In this they contradict the apostle who says, "All these things happened to them for an example,
and they were written for our learning, on whom the end of the world is come."347
<note type="footnote">346 Book iv.</note>
<note type="footnote">347 1 Cor. x. 6.</note>

<pb n="288"/>
The apostle here explains why these writings are to be received, and why it is no longer necessary
to continue the symbolical observances. For when he says, "They were written for
our learning," he clearly shows that we should be very diligent in reading and in discovering
the meaning of the Old Testament Scriptures, and that we should have great veneration for
them, since it was for us that they were written. Again, when he says, "They are our examples,"
and "these things happened to them for an example," he shows that, now that the
things themselves are clearly revealed, the observance of the actions by which these things
were prefigured is no longer binding. So he says elsewhere, "Let no man judge you in meat,
or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon or of the sabbath-days, which
are a shadow of things to come."348 Here also, when he says, "Let no one judge you" in these
things, he shows that we are no longer bound to observe them. And when he says, "which
are a shadow of things to come," he explains how these observances were binding at the
time when the things fully disclosed to us were symbolized by these shadows of future things.</p>
<p>3. Assuredly, if the Manichæans were justified by the resurrection of the Lord,—the
day of whose resurrection, the third after His passion, was the eighth day, coming after the
Sabbath, that is, after the seventh day,—their carnal minds would be delivered from the
darkness of earthly passions which rests on them; and rejoicing in the circumcision of the
heart, they would not ridicule it as prefigured in the Old Testament by circumcision in the
flesh, although they should not enforce this observance under the New Testament. But, as
the apostle says, "To the pure all things are pure. But to the impure and unbelieving nothing
is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled."349 So these people, who are so
pure in their own eyes, that they regard, or pretend to regard, as impure these members of
their bodies, are so defiled with unbelief and error, that, while they abhor the circumcision
of the flesh,—which the apostle calls a seal of the righteousness of faith,—they believe that
the divine members of their God are subjected to restraint and contamination in these very
carnal members of theirs. For they say that flesh is unclean; and it follows that God, in the
part which is detained by the flesh, is made unclean: for they declare that He must be
cleansed, and that till this is done, as far as it can be done, He undergoes all the passions to
which flesh is subject, not only in suffering pain and distress, but also in sensual gratification.
For it is for His sake, they say, that they abstain from sexual intercourse, that He may not
be bound more closely in the bondage of the flesh, nor suffer more defilement. The apostle
says, "To the pure all things are pure." And if this is true of men, who may be led into evil
by a perverse will, how much more must all things be pure to God, who remains for ever
immutable and immaculate! In those books which you defile with your violent reproaches,
it is said of the divine wisdom, that "no defiled thing falleth into it, and it goeth everywhere
<note type="footnote">348 Col. ii. 16, 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">349 Tit. i. 15.</note>

<pb n="289"/>
by reason of its pureness."350 It is mere prurient absurdity to find fault with the sign of
human regeneration appointed by that God, to whom all things are pure, to be put on the
organ of human generation, while you hold that your God, to whom nothing is pure, is in
a part of his nature subjected to taint and corruption by the vicious actions in which impure
men employ the members of their body. For if you think there is pollution in conjugal intercourse,
what must there be in all the practices of the licentious? If you ask, then, as you
often do, whether God could not find some other way of sealing the righteousness of faith,
the answer is, Why not this way, since all things are pure to the pure, much more to God?
And we have the authority of the apostle for saying that circumcision was the seal of the
righteousness of the faith of Abraham. As for you, you must try not to blush when you are
asked whether your God had nothing better to do than to entangle part of his nature with
these members that you revile so much. These are delicate subjects to speak of, on account
of the penal corruption attending the propagation of man. They are things which call into
exercise the modesty of the chaste, the passions of the impure, and the justice of God.</p>
<p>4. The rest of the Sabbath we consider no longer binding as an observance, now that
the hope of our eternal rest has been revealed. But it is a very useful thing to read of, and
to reflect on. In prophetic times, when things now manifested were prefigured and predicted
by actions as well as words, this sign of which we read was a presage of the reality which we
possess. But I wish to know why you observe a sort of partial rest. The Jews, on their Sabbath,
which they still keep in a carnal manner, neither gather any fruit in the field, nor dress and
cook it at home. But you, in your rest, wait till one of your followers takes his knife or hook
to the garden, to get food for you by murdering the vegetables, and brings back, strange to
say, living corpses. For if cutting plants is not murder, why are you afraid to do it? And
yet, if the plants are murdered, what becomes of the life which is to obtain release and restoration
from your mastication and digestion? Well, you take the living vegetables, and
certainly you ought, if it could be done to swallow them whole; so that after the one wound
your follower has been guilty of inflicting in pulling them, of which you will no doubt consent
to absolve him, they may reach without loss or injury your private laboratory, where your
God may be healed of his wound. Instead of this, you not only tear them with your teeth,
but, if it pleases your taste, mince them, inflicting a multitude of wounds in the most criminal
manner. Plainly it would be a most advantageous thing if you would rest at home too,
and not only once a week, like the Jews, but every day of the week. The cucumbers suffer
while you are cooking them, without any benefit to the life that is in them: for a boiling pot
cannot be compared to a saintly stomach. And yet you ridicule as superfluous the rest of
the Sabbath. Would it not be better, not only to refrain from finding fault with the fathers
for this observance, in whose case it was not superfluous, but, even now that it is superfluous,
<note type="footnote">350 Wisd. vii. 24, 25.</note>

<pb n="290"/>
to observe this rest yourselves instead of your own, which has no symbolical use, and is
condemned as grounded on falsehood? According to your own foolish opinions, you are
guilty of a defective observance of your own rest, though the observance itself is foolish in
the judgment of truth. You maintain that the fruit suffers when it is pulled from the tree,
when it is cut and scraped, and cooked, and eaten. So you are wrong in eating anything
that can not be swallowed raw and unhurt, so that the wound inflicted might not be from
you, but from your follower in pulling them. You declare that you could not give release
to so great a quantity of life, if you were to eat only things which could be swallowed without
cooking or mastication. But if this release compensates for all the pains you inflict, why is
it unlawful for you to pull the fruit? Fruit may be eaten raw, as some of your sect make a
point of eating raw vegetables of all kinds. But before it can be eaten at all, it must be pulled
or fall off, or be taken in some way from the ground or from the tree. You might well be
pardoned for pulling it, since nothing can be done without that, but not for torturing the
members of your God to the extent you do in dressing your food. One of your silly notions
is that the tree weeps when the fruit is pulled. Doubtless the life in the tree knows all things,
and perceives who it is that comes to it. If the elect were to come and pull the fruit, would
not the tree rejoice to escape the misery of having its fruit plucked by others, and to gain
felicity by enduring a little momentary pain? And yet, while you multiply the pains and
troubles of the fruit after it is plucked, you will not pluck it. Explain that, if you can! Fasting
itself is a mistake in your case. There should be no intermission in the task of purging away
the dross of the excrements from the spiritual gold, and of releasing the divine members
from confinement. The most merciful man among you is he who keeps himself always in
good health, takes raw food, and eats a great deal. But you are cruel when you eat, in making
your food undergo so much suffering; and you are cruel when you fast, in desisting from
the work of liberating the divine members.351</p>
<p>5. With all this, you venture to denounce the sacrifices of the Old Testament, and to
call them idolatry, and to attribute to us the same impious notion. To answer for ourselves
in the first place, while we consider it no longer a duty to offer sacrifices, we recognize sacrifices
as part of the mysteries of Revelation, by which the things prophesied were foreshadowed.
For they were our examples, and in many and various ways they all pointed to the
one sacrifice which we now commemorate. Now that this sacrifice has been revealed, and
has been offered in due time, sacrifice is no longer binding as an act of worship, while it retains

the end of the world is come."352 What you object to in sacrifice is the slaughter of animals,

though the whole animal creation is intended conditionally in some way for the use of man.
You are merciful to beasts, believing them to contain the souls of human beings, while you
refuse a piece of bread to a hungry beggar. The Lord Jesus, on the other hand, was cruel to
the swine when He granted the request of the devils to be allowed to enter into them. 353
The same Lord Jesus, before the sacrifice of His passion, said to a leper whom He had cured,
"Go, show thyself to the priest, and give the offering, as Moses commanded, for a testimony
unto them."354 When God, by the prophets, repeatedly declares that He needs no offering,
as indeed reason teaches us that offerings cannot be needed by Him who stands in need of
nothing, the human mind is led to inquire what God wished to teach us by these sacrifices.
For, assuredly, He would not have required offerings of which He had no need, except to
teach us something that it would profit us to know, and which was suitably set forth by
means of these symbols. How much better and more honorable it would be for you to be
still bound by these sacrifices, which have an instructive meaning, though they are not now
necessary, than to require your followers to offer to you as food what you believe to be living
victims. The Apostle Paul says most appropriately of some who preached the gospel to
gratify their appetite, that their "god was their belly."355 But the arrogance of your impiety
goes much beyond this; for, instead of making your belly your god, you do what is far worse
in making your belly the purifier of God. Surely it is great madness to make a pretence of
piety in not slaughtering animals, while you hold that the souls of animals inhabit all the
food you eat, and yet make what you call living creatures suffer such torture from your
hands and teeth.</p>
<p>6. If you will not eat flesh why should you not slay animals in sacrifice to your God, in
order that their souls, which you hold to be not only human, but so divine as to be members
of God Himself, may be released from the confinement of flesh, and be saved from returning
by the efficacy of your prayers? Perhaps, however, your stomach gives more effectual aid
than your intellect, and that part of divinity which has had the advantage of passing through
your bowels is more likely to be saved than that which has only the benefit of your prayers.
Your objection to eating flesh will be that you cannot eat animals alive, and so the operation
of your stomach will not avail for the liberation of their souls. Happy vegetables, that, torn
up with the hand, cut with knives, tortured in fire, ground by teeth, yet reach alive the altars
of your intestines! Unhappy sheep and oxen, that are not so tenacious of life, and therefore
are refused entrance into your bodies! Such is the absurdity of your notions. And you
persist in making out an opposition in us to the Old Testament, because we consider no
flesh unclean: according to the opinion of the apostle, "To the pure all things are pure;"356

and according to the saying of our Lord Himself, "Not that which goeth into your mouth
defileth you, but that which cometh out."357 This was not said to the crowd only, as your
Adimantus, whom Faustus, in his attack on the Old Testament, praises as second only to
Manichæus, wishes us to understand; but when retired from the crowd, the Lord repeated
this still more plainly and pointedly to His disciples. Adimantus quotes this saying of our
Lord in opposition to the Old Testament, where the people are prohibited from eating some
animals which are pronounced unclean; and doubtless he was afraid that he should be asked
why, since he quotes a passage from the Gospel about man not being defiled by what enters
into his mouth and passes into his belly, and out into the draft, he yet considers not some
only, but all flesh unclean, and abstains from eating it. It is in order to escape from this
strait, when the plain truth is too much for his error, that he makes the Lord say this to the
crowd; as if the Lord were in the habit of speaking the truth only in small companies, while
He blurted out falsehoods in public. To speak of the Lord in this way is blasphemy. And
all who read the passage can see that the Lord said the same thing more plainly to His disciples
in private. Since Faustus praises Adimantus so much at the beginning of this book of his,
placing him next to Manichæus, let him say in a word whether it is true or false that a man
is not defiled by what enters into his mouth. If it is false, why does this great teacher Adimantus
quote it against the Old Testament? If it is true, why, in spite of this, do you believe
that eating any flesh will defile you? It is true, if you choose this explanation, that the apostle
does not say that all things are pure to heretics, but, "to the pure all things are pure." The
apostle also goes on to explain why all things are not pure to heretics: "To the impure and
unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled."358 So to the
Manichæans there is absolutely nothing pure; for they hold that the very substance or nature
of God not only may be, but has actually been defiled, and so defiled that it can never be
wholly restored and purified. What do they mean when they call animals unclean, and refrain
from eating them, when it is impossible for them to think anything, whether food or whatever
it may be, clean? According to them, vegetables too, fruits, all kinds of crops, the earth and
sky, are defiled by mixture with the race of darkness. Why do they not act up to their
opinions about other things as well as about animals? Why do they not abstain altogether,
and starve themselves to death, instead of persisting in their blasphemies? If they will not
repent and reform, this is evidently the best thing that they could do.</p>
<p>7. The saying of the apostle, that "to the pure all things are pure," and that "every creature
of God is good," is not opposed to the prohibitions of the Old Testament; and the explanation,
if they can understand it, is this. The apostle speaks of the natures of the things, while the
Old Testament calls some animals unclean, not in their nature, but symbolically, on account
<note type="footnote">357 Matt. xvi. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">358 Tit. i. 15.</note>

<pb n="293"/>
of the prefigurative character of that dispensation. For instance, a pig and a lamb are both
clean in their nature, for every creature of God is good; but symbolically, a lamb is clean,
and a pig unclean. So the words wise and fool are both clean in their nature, as words
composed of letters but fool may be called symbolically unclean, because it means an unclean
thing. Perhaps a pig is the same among symbols as a fool is among real things. The animal,
and the four letters which compose the word, may mean the same thing. No doubt the animal
is pronounced unclean by the law, because it does not chew the cud; which is not a
fault but its nature. But the men of whom this animal is a symbol are unclean, not by nature,
but from their own fault; because, though they gladly hear the words of wisdom, they never
reflect on them afterwards. For to recall, in quiet repose, some useful instruction from the
stomach of memory to the mouth of reflection, is a kind of spiritual rumination. The animals
above mentioned are a symbol of those people who do not do this. And the prohibition of
the flesh of these animals is a warning against this fault. Another passage of Scripture speaks
of the precious treasure of wisdom, and describes ruminating as clean, and not ruminating
as unclean: "A precious treasure resteth in the mouth of a wise man; but a foolish man
swallows it up."359 Symbols of this kind, either in words or in things, give useful and
pleasant exercise to intelligent minds in the way of inquiry and comparison. But formerly
people were required not only to hear, but to practise many such things. For at that time it
was necessary that, by deeds as well as by words, those things should be foreshadowed which
were in after times to be revealed. After the revelation by Christ and in Christ, the community
of believers is not burdened with the practice of the observances, but is admonished to give
heed to the prophecy. This is our reason for accounting no animals unclean, in accordance
with the saying of the Lord and of the apostle, while we are not opposed to the Old Testament,
where some animals are pronounced unclean. Now let us hear why you consider all animal
food unclean.</p>
<p>8. One of your false doctrines is, that flesh is unclean on account of mixture with the
race of darkness. But this would make not only flesh unclean, but your God himself, in that
part which he sent to become subject to absorption and contamination, in order that the
enemy might be conquered and taken captive. Besides, on account of this mixture, all that
you eat must be unclean. But you say flesh is especially unclean. It requires patience to
listen to all their absurd reasons for this peculiar impurity of flesh. I will mention only what
will suffice to show the inveterate folly of these critics of the Old Testament, who, while they
denounce flesh, savor only fleshly things, and have no sort of spiritual perception. And a
lengthy discussion of this question may perhaps enable us to dispense with saying much on
some other points. The following, then, is an account of their vain delusions in this matter:—
In that battle, when the First Man ensnared the race of darkness by deceitful elements,
<note type="footnote">359 Prov. xxi. 20.</note>

<pb n="294"/>
princes of both sexes belonging to this race were taken. By means of these princes the world
was constructed; and among those used in the formation of the heavenly bodies, were some
pregnant females. When the sky began to rotate, the rapid circular motion made these females
give birth to abortions, which, being of both sexes, fell on the earth, and lived, and
grew, and came together, and produced offspring. Hence sprang all animal life in earth,
air, and sea.360 Now if the origin of flesh is from heaven, that is no reason for thinking it
especially unclean. Indeed, in this construction of the world, they hold that these principles
of darkness were arranged higher or lower, according to the greater or less amount of good
mixed with them in the construction of the various parts of the world. So flesh ought to be
cleaner than vegetables which come out of the earth, for it comes from heaven. And how
irrational to suppose that the abortions, before becoming animate, were so lively, though
in an abortive state, that after falling from the sky, they could live and multiply; whereas,
after becoming animate, they die if brought forth prematurely, and a fall from a very moderate
height is enough to kill them! The kingdom of life in contest with the kingdom of
death ought to have improved them, by giving them life instead of making them more perishable
than before. If the perishableness is a consequence of a change of nature, it is wrong
to say that there is a bad nature. The change is the only cause of the perishableness. Both
natures are good, though one is better than the other. Whence then comes the peculiar
impurity of flesh as it exists in this world, sprung, as they say, from heaven? They tell us,
indeed, of the first bodies of these principles of darkness being generated like worms from
trees of darkness; and the trees, they say, are produced from the five elements. But supposing
that the bodies of animals come in the first place from trees, and afterwards from heaven,
why should they be more unclean than the fruit of trees? Perhaps it will be said that what
remains after death is unclean, because the life is no longer there. For the same reason fruits
and vegetables must be unclean, for they die when they are pulled or cut. As we saw before,
the elect get others to bring their food to them, that they may not be guilty of murder.
Perhaps, since they say that every living being has two souls, one of the race of light, and
the other of the race of darkness, the good soul leaves at death, and the bad soul remains.
But, in that case, the animal would be as much alive as it was in the kingdom of darkness,
when it had only the soul of its own race, with which it had rebelled against the kingdom
of God. So, since both souls leave at death, why call the flesh unclean, as if only the good
soul had left? Any life that remains must be of both kinds; for some remains of the members
of God are found, we are told, even in filth. There is therefore no reason for making flesh
more unclean than fruits. The truth is, they pretend to great chastity in holding flesh unclean
because it is generated. But if the divine body is more grossly shut in by flesh, there is all
the more reason that they should liberate it by eating. And there are innumerable kinds of
<note type="footnote">360 [Compare the Introduction, where an abstract is given of the Fihrist’s account of the creation.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="295"/>
worms not produced from sexual intercourse; some in the neighborhood of Venice come
from trees, which they should eat, since there is not the same reason for their being unclean.
Besides, there are the frogs produced by the earth after a shower of rain.361 Let them liberate
the members of their God from these. Let them rebuke the mistake of mankind in preferring
fowls and pigeons produced from males and females to the pure frogs, daughters of heaven
and earth. By this theory, the first principles of darkness produced from trees must be purer
than Manichæus, who was produced by generation; and his followers, for the same reason,
must be less pure than the lice which spring from the perspiration of their bodies. But if
everything that comes from flesh is unclean, because the origin of flesh itself is unclean,
fruits and vegetables must also be unclean, because they are manured with dung. After this,
what becomes of the notion that fruits are cleaner than flesh? Dung is the most unclean
product of flesh, and also the most fertilizing manure. Their doctrine is, that the life escapes
in the mastication and digestion of the food, so that only a particle remains in the excrement.
How is it, then, that this particle of life has such an effect on the growth and the quality of
your favorite food? Flesh is nourished by the productions of the earth, not by its excrements;
while the earth is nourished by the excrements of flesh, not by its productions. Let them
say which is the cleaner. Or let them turn from being unbelieving and impure to whom
nothing is clean, and join with us in embracing the doctrine of the apostle, that to the pure
all things are pure; that the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof; that every creature
of God is good. All things in nature are good in their own order; and no one sins in using
them, unless, by disobedience to God, he transgresses his own order, and disturbs their order
by using them amiss.</p>
<p>9. The elders who pleased God kept their own order by their obedience, in observing,
according to God’s arrangement, what was appointed as suitable to certain times. So, although
all animals intended for food are by nature clean, they abstained from some which
had then a symbolical uncleanness, in preparation for the future revelation of the things
signified. And so with regard to unleavened bread and all such things, in which the apostle
says there was a shadow of future things, neglect of their observance under the old dispensation,
when this observance was enjoined, and was employed to prefigure what was afterwards
to be revealed, would have been as criminal, as it would now be foolish in us, after the light
of the New Testament has arisen, to think that these predictive observances could be of any
use to us. On the other hand, since the Old Testament teaches us that the things now revealed
were so long ago prefigured, that we may be firm and faithful in our adherence to them, it

<pb n="296"/>
would be blasphemy and impiety to discard these books, simply because the Lord requires
of us now not a literal, but a spiritual and intelligent regard to their contents. They were
written, as the apostle says, for our admonition, on whom the end of the world is come.362
"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning."363 Not to
eat unleavened bread in the appointed seven days was a sin in the time of the Old Testament;
in the time of the New Testament it is not a sin. But having the hope of a future world
through Christ, who makes us altogether new by clothing our souls with righteousness and
our bodies with immortality, to believe that the bondage and infirmity of our original corruption
will prevail over us or over our actions, must continue to be a sin, till the seven days
of the course of time are accomplished. In the time of the Old Testament, this, under the
disguise of a type, was perceived by some saints. In the time of the New Testament it is fully
declared and publicly preached.364</p>
<p>What was then a precept of Scripture is now a testimony. Formerly, not to keep the
feast of tabernacles was a sin, which is not the case now. But not to form part of the building
of God’s tabernacle, which is the Church, is always a sin. Formerly this was acted in a figure;
now the record serves as testimony. The ancient tabernacle, indeed, would not have been
called the tabernacle of the testimony, unless as an appropriate symbol it had borne testimony
to some truth which was to be revealed in its own time. To patch linen garments with purple,
or to wear a garment of woollen and linen together, is not a sin now. But to live intemperately,
and to wish to combine opposite modes of life,—as when a woman devoted to religion
wears the ornaments of married women, or when one who has not abstained from marriage
dresses like a virgin,—is always sin. So it is sin whenever inconsistent things are combined
in any man’s life. This, which is now a moral truth, was then symbolized in dress. What
was then a type is now revealed truth. So the same Scripture which then required symbolical
actions, now testifies to the things signified. The prefigurative observance is now a record
for the confirmation of our faith. Formerly it was unlawful to plough with an ox and an ass
together; now it is lawful. The apostle explains this when he quotes the text about not
muzzling the ox that is treading out the corn. He says, "Does God care for oxen?" What,
then, have we to do with an obsolete prohibition? The apostle teaches us in the following
words, "For our sakes it is written."365 It must be impiety in us not to read what was written
for our sakes; for it is more for our sakes, to whom the revelation belongs, than for theirs
who had only the figure. There is no harm in joining an ox with an ass where it is required.

But to put a wise man and a fool together, not that one should teach and the other obey, but
that both with equal authority should declare the word of God, cannot be done without
causing offence. So the same Scripture which was once a command enjoining the shadow
in which future things were veiled, is now an authoritative witness to the unveiled truth.</p>
<p>In what he says of the uncleanness of a man that is bald or has red hair, Faustus is inaccurate,
or the manuscript he has used is incorrect.366 Would that Faustus were not ashamed
to bear on his forehead the cross of Christ, the want of which is baldness, instead of maintaining
that Christ, who says, "I am the truth," showed unreal marks, after His resurrection,
of unreal wounds! Faustus says he has not learned the art of deceiving, and speaks what he
thinks. He cannot therefore be a disciple of his Christ, whom he madly declares to have
shown false marks of wounds to his disciples when they doubted. Are we to believe Faustus,
not only in his other absurdities, but also when he tells us that he does not deceive us in
calling Christ a deceiver? Is he better than Christ? Is he not a deceiver, while Christ is? Or
does he prove himself to be a disciple not of the truthful Christ, but of the deceiver
Manichæus, by this very falsehood, when he boasts that he has not learned the art of deceiving?</p>

<p>The genealogical question is again taken up and argued on both sides.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You ask why I do not believe in the genealogy of Jesus. There are many
reasons; but the principal is, that He never declares with His own lips that He had an earthly
father or descent, but on the contrary, that he is not of this world, that He came forth from
God the Father, that He descended from heaven, that He has no mother or brethren except
those who do the will of His Father in heaven. Besides, the framers of these genealogies do
not seem to have known Jesus before His birth or soon after it, so as to have the credibility
of eye-witnesses of what they narrate. They became acquainted with Jesus as a young man
of about thirty years of age, if it is not blasphemy to speak of the age of a divine being. Now
the question regarding a witness is always whether he has seen or heard what he testifies
to. But the writers of these genealogies never assert that they heard the account from Jesus
Himself, nor even the fact of His birth; nor did they see Him till they came to know Him
after his baptism, many years after the time of His birth. To me, therefore, and to every
sensible man, it appears as foolish to believe this account, as it would be to call into court a
blind and deaf witness.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: As regards what Faustus calls his principal reason for not receiving
the genealogy of Jesus Christ, a complete refutation is found in the passages formerly quoted,
where Christ declares Himself to be the Son of man, and in what we have said of the identity
of the Son of man with the Son of God: that in His Godhead He has no earthly descent,
while after the flesh He is of the seed of David, as the apostle teaches. We are to believe,
therefore, that He came forth from the Father, that He descended from heaven, and also
that the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst men. If the words, "Who is my mother,
and who are my brethren?"367 are quoted to show that Christ had no earthly mother or
descent, it follows that we must believe that His disciples, whom He here teaches by His
own example to set no value on earthly relationship, as compared with the kingdom of
heaven, had no fathers, because Christ says to them, "Call no man father upon earth; for
one is your Father, even God."368 What He taught them to do with reference to their fathers,
He Himself first did in reference to His own mother and brethren; as in many other things
He condescended to set us an example, and to go before that we might follow in His footsteps.
Faustus’ principal objection to the genealogy fails completely; and after the defeat of
this invincible force, the rest is easily routed. He says that the apostles who declared Christ
to be the Son of man as well as the Son of God are not to be believed, because they were not
present at the birth of Christ, whom they joined when He had reached manhood, nor heard
<note type="footnote">367 Matt. xii. 48.</note>

<pb n="299"/>
of it from Christ Himself. Why then do they believe John when he says, "In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything
made,"369 and such passages, which they agree to, without understanding them? Where
did John see this, or did he ever hear it from the Lord Himself? In whatever way John learned
this, those who narrate the nativity may have learned also. Again, how do they know that
the Lord said, "Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?" If on the authority of the
evangelist, why do they not also believe that the mother and the brethren of Christ were
seeking for Him? They believe that Christ said these words, which they misunderstand,
while they deny a fact resting on the same authority. Once more, if Matthew could not
know that Christ was born, because he knew Him only in His manhood, how could
Manichæus, who lived so long after, know that He was not born? They will say that
Manichæus knew this from the Holy Spirit which was in him. Certainly the Holy Spirit
would make him speak the truth. But why not rather believe what Christ’s own disciples
tell us, who were personally acquainted with Him, and who not only had the gift of inspiration
to supply defects in their knowledge, but in a purely natural way obtained information of
the birth of Christ, and of His descent, when the event was fresh in memory? And yet he
dares to call the apostles deaf and blind. Why were you not deaf and blind, to prevent you
from learning such profane nonsense, and dumb too, to prevent you from uttering it?</p>

<p>Faustus maintains that to hold to the Old Testament after the giving of the New is putting
new cloth on an old garment. Augustin further explains the relation of the Old Testament
to the New, and reproaches the Manichæans with carnality.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Another reason for not receiving the Old Testament is, that I am
provided with the New; and Scripture says that old and new do not agree. For "no one
putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, otherwise the rent is made worse."370 To
avoid making a worse rent, as you have done, I do not mix Christian newness with Hebrew
oldness. Every one accounts it mean, when a man has got a new dress, not to give the old
one to his inferiors. So, even if I were a Jew by birth, as the apostles were, it would be
proper for me, on receiving the New Testament, to discard the Old, as the apostles did. And
having the advantage of being born free from the yoke of bondage, and being early introduced
into the full liberty of Christ, what a foolish and ungrateful wretch I should be to put myself
again under the yoke! This is what Paul blames the Galatians for; because, going back to
circumcision, they turned again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto they desired
again to be in bondage.371 Why should I do what I see another blamed for doing? My going
into bondage would be worse than their returning to it.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: We have already shown sufficiently why and how we maintain
the authority of the Old Testament, not for the imitation of Jewish bondage, but for the
confirmation of Christian liberty. It is not I, but the apostle, who says, "All these things
happened to them as an example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the
ends of the world are come."372 We do not therefore, as bondmen, observe what was enjoined
as predictive of us; but as free, we read what was written to confirm us. So any one may see
that the apostle remonstrates with the Galatians not for devoutly reading what Scripture
says of circumcision, but for superstitiously desiring to be circumcised. We do not put a
new cloth to an old garment, but we are instructed in the kingdom of heaven, like the
householder, whom the Lord describes as bringing out of his treasure things new and old.373
He who puts a new cloth to an old garment is the man who attempts spiritual self-denial
before he has renounced fleshly hope. Examine the passage, and you will see that, when the
Lord was asked about fasting, He replied, "No man putteth a new cloth to an old garment."
The disciples had still a carnal affection for the Lord; for they were afraid that, if He died,
they would lose Him. So He calls Peter Satan for dissuading Him from suffering, because

he understood not the things of God, but the things of men.374 The fleshly character of
your hope is evident from your fancies about the kingdom of God, and from your paying
homage and devotion to the light of the sun, which the carnal eye perceives, as if it were an
image of heaven. So your carnal mind is the old garment to which you join your fasts.
Moreover, if a new cloth and an old garment do not agree, how do the members of your
God come to be not only joined or fastened, but to be united far more intimately by mixture
and coherence to the principles of darkness? Perhaps both are old, because both are false,
and both of the carnal mind. Or perhaps you wish to prove that one was new and the other
old, by the rent being made worse, in tearing away the unhappy piece of the kingdom of
light, to be doomed to eternal imprisonment in the mass of darkness. So this pretended
artist in the fashions of the sacred Scriptures is found stitching together absurdities, and
dressing himself in the rags of his own invention.</p>

<p>Faustus argues that if the apostles born under the old covenant could lawfully depart from it,
much more can he having been born a Gentile. Augustin explains the relation of Jews
and Gentiles alike to the Gospel.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Another reason for not receiving the Old Testament is, that if it was
allowable for the apostles, who were born under it, to abandon it, much more may I, who
was not born under it, be excused for not thrusting myself into it. We Gentiles are not born
Jews, nor Christians either. Out of the same Gentile world some are induced by the Old
Testament to become Jews, and some by the New Testament to become Christians. It is as
if two trees, a sweet and a bitter, drew from one soil the sap which each assimilates to its
own nature. The apostle passed from the bitter to the sweet; it would be madness in me to
change from the sweet to the bitter.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: You say that the apostle, in leaving Judaism, passed from the bitter
to the sweet. But the apostle himself says that the Jews, who would not believe in Christ,
were branches broken off, and that the Gentiles, a wild olive tree, were grafted into the good
olive, that is, the holy stock of the Hebrews, that they might partake of the fatness of the
olive. For, in warning the Gentiles not to be proud on account of the fall of the Jews, he
says: "For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles. I magnify
my office; if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might
save some of them. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what
shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? For if the first fruit be holy, the lump
is also holy; and if the root be holy, so are the branches. And if some of the branches are
broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them
partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the branches: but if thou
boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. Thou wilt say then, The branches were
broken off, that I might be grafted in. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and
thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural
branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity
of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in His
goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief,
shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again. For if thou wert cut out of the
olive tree, which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive
tree; how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own
olive tree? For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery (lest ye
should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the
fullness of the Gentiles be come in; and so all Israel shall be saved."375 It appears from this,
<note type="footnote">375 Rom. xi. 16-26.</note>

<pb n="303"/>
that you, who do not wish to be graffed into this root, though you are not broken off, like
the carnal unbelieving Jews, remain still in the bitterness of the wild olive. Your worship
of the sun and moon has the true Gentile flavor. You are none the less in the wild olive of
the Gentiles, because you have added thorns of a new kind, and worship along with the sun
and moon a false Christ, the fabrication not of your hands, but of your perverse heart.
Come, then, and be grafted into the root of the olive tree, in his return to which the apostle
rejoices, after by unbelief he had been among the broken branches. He speaks of himself
as set free, when he made the happy transition from Judaism to Christianity. For Christ
was always preached in the olive tree, and those who did not believe on Him when He came
were broken off, while those who believed were grafted in. These are thus warned against
pride: "Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural branches, neither
will He spare thee." And to prevent despair of those broken off, he adds: "And they also, if
they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary
to nature into a good olive tree, how much more shall these, which be the natural branches,
be grafted into their own olive tree." The apostle rejoices in being delivered from the condition
of a broken branch, and in being restored to the fatness of the olive tree. So you who
have been broken off by error should return and be grafted in again. Those who are still in
the wild olive should separate themselves from its barrenness, and become partakers of
fertility.</p>

<p>Faustus insists that the Old Testament promises are radically different from those of the New.
Augustin admits a difference, but maintains that the moral precepts are the same in both.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Another reason for not receiving the Old Testament is, that both the
Old and the New teach us not to covet what belongs to others. Everything in the Old Test-
ament is of this kind. It promises riches, and plenty, and children, and children’s children,
and long life, and withal the land of Canaan; but only to the circumcised, the Sabbath observers,
those offering sacrifices, and abstaining from swine’s flesh. Now I, like every other
Christian, pay no attention to these things, as being trifling and useless for the salvation of
the soul. I conclude, therefore, that the promises do not belong to me. And mindful of the
commandment, Thou shall not covet, I gladly leave to the Jews their own property, and
content myself with the gospel, and with the bright inheritance of the kingdom of heaven.
If a Jew were to claim part in the gospel, I should justly reproach him with claiming what
he had no right to, because he does not obey its precepts. And a Jew might say the same to
me if I professed to receive the Old Testament while I disregard its requirements.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: Faustus is not ashamed to repeat the same nonsense again and
again. But it is tiresome to repeat the same answers, though it is to repeat truth. What
Faustus says here has already been answered.376 But if a Jew asks me why I profess to believe
the Old Testament while I do not observe its precepts, my reply is this: The moral precepts
of the law are observed by Christians; the symbolical precepts were properly observed during
the time that the things now revealed were prefigured. Accordingly, those observances,
which I regard as no longer binding, I still look upon as a testimony, as I do also the carnal
promises from which the Old Testament derives its name. For although the gospel teaches
me to hope for eternal blessings, I also find a confirmation of the gospel in those things
which "happened to them for an example, and were written for our admonition, on whom
the ends of the world are come." So much for our answer to the Jews. And now we have
something to say to the Manichæans.</p>
<p>3. By showing the way in which we regard the authority of the Old Testament we have
answered the Jews, by whose question about our not observing the precepts Faustus thought
we would be puzzled. But what answer can you give to the question, why you deceive simpleminded
people by professing to believe in the New Testament, while you not only do not
believe it, but assail it with all your force? It will be more difficult for you to answer this
than it was for us to answer the Jews. We hold all that is written in the Old Testament to
be true, and enjoined by God for suitable times. But in your inability to find a reason for
not receiving what is written in the New Testament, you are obliged, as a last resource, to
<note type="footnote">376 Book vi. 2.</note>

<pb n="305"/>
pretend that the passages are not genuine. This is the last gasp of a heretic in the clutches
of truth; or rather it is the breath of corruption itself. Faustus, however, confesses that the
Old Testament as well as the New teaches him not to covet. His own God could never have
taught him this. For if this God did not covet what belonged to another, why did he construct
new worlds in the region of darkness? Perhaps the race of darkness first coveted his kingdom.
But this would be to imitate their bad example. Perhaps the kingdom of light was
previously of small extent, and war was desirable in order to enlarge it by conquest. In that
case, no doubt, there was covetousness, though the hostile race was allowed to begin the
wars to justify the conquest. If there had been no such desire, there was no necessity to extend
the kingdom beyond its old limits into the region of the conquered foe. If the Manichæans
would only learn from these Scriptures the moral precepts, one of which is, Do not covet,
instead of taking offence at the symbolical precept, they would acknowledge in meekness
and candor that they suited the time then present. We do not covet what belongs to another,
when we read in the Old Testament what "happened to them for examples, and was written
for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come." It is surely not coveting
when a man reads what is written for his benefit.</p>

<head>Book XI.</head>
<p>Faustus quotes passages to show that the Apostle Paul abandoned belief in the incarnation,
to which he earlier held. Augustin shows that the apostle was consistent with himself in
the utterances quoted.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Assuredly I believe the apostle. And yet I do not believe that the Son
of God was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,377 because I do not believe that
God’s apostle could contradict himself, and have one opinion about our Lord at one time,
and another at another. But, granting that he wrote this,—since you will not hear of anything
being spurious in his writings,—it is not against us. For this seems to be Paul’s old belief
about Jesus, when he thought, like everybody else, that Jesus was the son of David. Afterwards,
when he learned that this was false, he corrects himself; and in his Epistle to the
Corinthians he says: "We know no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ
after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more."378 Observe the difference
between these two verses. In one he asserts that Jesus was the son of David after the flesh;
in the other he says that now he knows no man after the flesh. If Paul wrote both, it can
only have been in the way I have stated. In the next verse he adds: "Therefore, if any man
be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
new." The belief that Jesus was born of the seed of David according to the flesh is of this
old transitory kind; whereas the faith which knows no man after the flesh is new and permanent.
So, he says elsewhere: "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a
child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things."379 We
are thus warranted in preferring the new and amended confession of Paul to his old and
faulty one. And if you hold by what is said in the Epistle to the Romans, why should not
we hold by what is said to the Corinthians? But it is only by your insisting on the correctness
of the text that we are made to represent Paul as building again the things which he destroyed,
in spite of his own repudiation of such prevarication. If the verse is Paul’s, he has corrected
himself. If Paul should not be supposed to have written anything requiring correction, the
verse is not his.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: As I said a little ago, when these men are beset by clear testimonies
of Scripture, and cannot escape from their grasp, they declare that the passage is spurious.
The declaration only shows their aversion to the truth, and their obstinacy in error. Unable
to answer these statements of Scripture, they deny their genuineness. But if this answer is
admitted, or allowed to have any weight, it will be useless to quote any book or any passage

against your errors. It is one thing to reject the books themselves, and to profess no regard
for their authority, as the Pagans reject our Scriptures, and the Jews the New Testament,
and as we reject any books peculiar to your sect, or any other heretical sect, and also the
apocryphal books, which are so called, not because of any mysterious regard paid to them,
but because they are mysterious in their origin, and in the absence of clear evidence, have
only some obscure presumption to rest upon; and it is another thing to say, This holy man
wrote only the truth, and this is his epistle, but some verses are his, and some are not. And
then, when you are asked for a proof, instead of referring to more correct or more ancient
manuscripts, or to a greater number, or to the original text, your reply is, This verse is his,
because it makes for me; and this is not his, because it is against me. Are you, then, the rule
of truth? Can nothing be true that is against you? But what answer could you give to an
opponent as insane as yourself, if he confronts you by saying, The passage in your favor is
spurious, and that against you is genuine? Perhaps you will produce a book, all of which
can be explained so as to support you. Then, instead of rejecting a passage, he will reply by
condemning the whole book as spurious. You have no resource against such an opponent.
For all the testimony you can bring in favor of your book from antiquity or tradition will
avail nothing. In this respect the testimony of the Catholic Church is conspicuous, as supported
by a succession of bishops from the original seats of the apostles up to the present
time, and by the consent of so many nations. Accordingly, should there be a question about
the text of some passage, as there are a few passages with various readings well known to
students of the sacred Scriptures, we should first consult the manuscripts of the country
where the religion was first taught; and if these still varied, we should take the text of the
greater number, or of the more ancient. And if any uncertainty remained, we should consult
the original text. This is the method employed by those who, in any question about the
Scriptures, do not lose sight of the regard due to their authority, and inquire with the view
of gaining information, not of raising disputes.380</p>
<p>3. As regards the passage from Paul’s epistle which teaches, in opposition to your heresy,
that the Son of God was born of the seed of David, it is found in all manuscripts both new
and old of all Churches, and in all languages. So the profession which Faustus makes of
believing the apostle is hypocritical. Instead of saying, "Assuredly I believe," he should have
said, Assuredly I do not believe, as he would have said if he had not wished to deceive people.
What part of his belief does he get from the apostle? Not the first man, of whom the apostle
says that he is of the earth, earthy; and again, "The first man Adam was made a living soul."
Faustus’ First Man is neither of the earth, earthy, nor made a living soul, but of the substance
of God, and the same in essence as God; and this being is said to have mixed up with the
<note type="footnote">380 [The extremely subjective method of dealing with Scripture which Augustin ascribes to Faustus, was
characteristic of Manichæism in general.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="308"/>
race of darkness his members, or vesture, or weapons, that is, the five elements, which also
are part of the substance of God, so that they became subject to confinement and pollution.
Nor does Faustus get from Paul his Second Man, of whom Paul says that He is from heaven,
and that He is the last Adam, and a quickening spirit; and also that He was born of the seed
of David after the flesh, that He was made of a woman, made under the law, that He might
redeem them that were under the law.381 Of Him Paul says to Timothy: "Remember that
Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead, according to my gospel."382
And this resurrection he quotes as an example of our resurrection: "I delivered unto you
first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins, according to the
Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the
Scriptures." And a little further on he draws an inference from this doctrine: "Now, if Christ
be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection
of the dead?" 383 Our professed believer in Paul believes nothing of all this. He denies
that Jesus was born of the seed of David, that He was made of a woman (by the word woman
is not meant a wife in the common sense of the word, but merely one of the female sex, as
in the book of Genesis, where it is said that God made a woman before she was brought to
Adam384); he denies His death, His burial, and His resurrection. He holds that Christ had
not a mortal body, and therefore could not really die; and that the marks of His wounds
which He showed to His disciples when He appeared to them alive after His resurrection,
which Paul also mentions,385 were not real. He denies, too, that our mortal body will be
raised again, changed into a spiritual body; as Paul teaches: "It is sown a natural body, it is
raised a spiritual body." To illustrate this distinction between the natural and the spiritual
body, the apostle adds what I have quoted already about the first and the last Adam. Then
he goes on: "But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God." And to explain what he means by flesh and blood, that it is not the bodily substance,
but corruption, which will not enter into the resurrection of the just, he immediately says,
"Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption." And in case any one should still suppose
that it is not what is buried that is to rise again, but that it is as if one garment were laid aside
and a better taken instead, he proceeds to show distinctly that the same body will be changed
for the better, as the garments of Christ on the mount were not displaced, but transfigured:
"Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all be changed, but we shall all rise."386 Then
<note type="footnote">381 Gal. iv. 4, 5.</note>

<note type="footnote">385 1 Cor. xi. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">386 Vulg.</note>

<pb n="309"/>
he shows who are to be changed: "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be
changed." And if it should be said that it is not as regards our mortal and corruptible body,
but as regards our soul, that we are to be changed, it should be observed that the apostle is
not speaking of the soul, but of the body, as is evident from the question he starts with: "But
some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what body do they come?" So also, in
the conclusion of his argument, he leaves no doubt of what he is speaking: "This corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."387 Faustus denies
this; and the God whom Paul declares to be "immortal, incorruptible, to whom alone is
glory and honor,"388 he makes corruptible. For in this monstrous and horrible fiction of
theirs, the substance and nature of God was in danger of being wholly corrupted by the race
of darkness, and to save the rest part actually was corrupted. And to crown all this, he tries
to deceive the ignorant who are not learned in the sacred Scriptures, by making this profession:
I assuredly believe the Apostle Paul; when he ought to have said, I assuredly do not
believe.</p>
<p>4. But Faustus has a proof to show that Paul changed his mind, and, in writing to the
Corinthians, corrected what he had written to the Romans; or else that he never wrote the
passage which appears as his, about Jesus Christ being born of the seed of David according
to the flesh. And what is this proof? If the passage, he says, in the Epistle to the Romans is
true, "the Son of God, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh," what he
says to the Corinthians cannot be true, "Henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea,
though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more."
We must therefore show that both these passages are true, and not opposed to one another.
The agreement of the manuscripts proves both to be genuine. In some Latin versions the
word "born"389 is used instead of "made,"390 which is not so literal a rendering, but gives
the same meaning. For both these translations, as well as the original, teach that Christ was
of the seed of David after the flesh. We must not for a moment suppose that Paul corrected
himself on account of a change of opinion. Faustus himself felt the impropriety and impiety
of such an explanation, and preferred to say that the passage was spurious, instead of that
Paul was mistaken.</p>
<p>5. As regards our writings, which are not a rule of faith or practice, but only a help to
edification, we may suppose that they contain some things falling short of the truth in obscure
and recondite matters, and that these mistakes may or may not be corrected in subsequent

treatises. For we are of those of whom the apostle says: "And if ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you."391 Such writings are read with the right of judgment,
and without any obligation to believe. In order to leave room for such profitable discussions
of difficult questions, there is a distinct boundary line separating all productions subsequent
to apostolic times from the authoritative canonical books of the Old and New Testaments.
The authority of these books has come down to us from the apostles through the successions
of bishops and the extension of the Church, and, from a position of lofty supremacy, claims
the submission of every faithful and pious mind. If we are perplexed by an apparent contradiction
in Scripture, it is not allowable to say, The author of this book is mistaken; but either
the manuscript is faulty, or the translation is wrong, or you have not understood. In the
innumerable books that have been written latterly we may sometimes find the same truth
as in Scripture, but there is not the same authority. Scripture has a sacredness peculiar to
itself. In other books the reader may form his own opinion, and perhaps, from not understanding
the writer, may differ from him, and may pronounce in favor of what pleases him,
or against what he dislikes. In such cases, a man is at liberty to withhold his belief, unless
there is some clear demonstration or some canonical authority to show that the doctrine or
statement either must or may be true. But in consequence of the distinctive peculiarity of
the sacred writings, we are bound to receive as true whatever the canon shows to have been
said by even one prophet, or apostle, or evangelist. Otherwise, not a single page will be left
for the guidance of human fallibility, if contempt for the wholesome authority of the canonical
books either puts an end to that authority altogether, or involves it in hopeless confusion.</p>
<p>6. With regard, then, to this apparent contradiction between the passage which speaks
of the Son of God being of the seed of David, to the words, "Though we have known Christ
after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more," even though both quotations
were not from the writings of one apostle,—though one were from Paul, and the other from
Peter, or Isaiah, or any other apostle or prophet,—such is the equality of canonical authority,
that it would not be allowable to doubt of either. For the utterances of Scripture, harmonious
as if from the mouth of one man, commend themselves to the belief of the most accurate
and clear-sighted piety, and demand for their discovery and confirmation the calmest intelligence
and the most ingenious research. In the case before us both quotations are from the
canonical, that is, the genuine epistles of Paul. We cannot say that the manuscript is faulty,
for the best Latin translations substantially agree; or that the translations are wrong, for the
best texts have the same reading. So that, if any one is perplexed by the apparent contradic-

with far more consistency than by Catholics.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="311"/>
tion, the only conclusion is that he does not understand. Accordingly it remains for me to
explain how both passages, instead of being contradictory, may be harmonized by one rule
of sound faith. The pious inquirer will find all perplexity removed by a careful examination.</p>
<p>7. That the Son of God was made man of the seed of David, is not only said in other
places by Paul, but is taught elsewhere in sacred Scripture. As regards the words, "Though
we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more," the
context shows what is the apostle’s meaning. Here, or elsewhere, he views with an assured
hope, as if it were already present and in actual possession, our future life, which is now
fulfilled in our risen Head and Mediator, the man Christ Jesus. This life will certainly not
be after the flesh, even as Christ’s life is now not after the flesh. For by flesh the apostle here
means not the substance of our bodies, in which sense the Lord used the word when, after
His resurrection, He said, "Handle me, and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye
see me have,"393 but the corruption and mortality of flesh, which will then not be in us, as
now it is not in Christ. The apostle uses the word flesh in the sense of corruption in the
passage about the resurrection quoted before: "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
of God, neither shall corruption inherit incorruption." So, after the event described in the
next verse, "Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall all rise, but we shall not all be changed.
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump (for the trumpet shall sound); and
the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,"394—then flesh, in the sense
of the substance of the body, will, after this change, no longer have flesh, in the sense of the
corruption of mortality; and yet, as regards its own nature, it will be the same flesh, the same
which rises and which is changed. What the Lord said after His resurrection is true, "Handle
me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have;" and what the apostle
says is true, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." The first is said of the
bodily substance, which exists as the subject of the change: the second is said of the corruption
of the flesh, which will cease to exist, for, after its change, flesh will not be corrupted.
So, "we have known Christ after the flesh," that is, after the mortality of flesh, before His
resurrection; "now henceforth we know Him no more," because, as the same apostle says,
"Christ being risen from the dead, dieth no more, and death hath no more dominion over
Him." 395 The words, "we have known Christ after the flesh," strictly speaking, imply that
Christ was after the flesh, for what never was cannot be known. And it is not "we have
supposed," but "we have known." But not to insist on a word, in case some one should say
that known is used in the sense of supposed, it is astonishing, if one could be surprised at

<pb n="312"/>
want of sight in a blind man, that these blind people do not perceive that if what the apostle
says about not knowing Christ after the flesh proves that Christ had not flesh, then what he
says in the same place of not knowing any one henceforth after the flesh proves that all those
here referred to had not flesh. For when he speaks of not knowing any one, he cannot intend
to speak only of Christ; but in his realization of the future life with those who are to be
changed at the resurrection, he says, "Henceforth we know no man after the flesh;" that is,
we have such an assured hope of our future incorruption and immortality, that the thought
of it makes us rejoice even now. So he says elsewhere: "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek
those things that are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affections
upon things above, and not on things on the earth."396 It is true we have not yet risen as
Christ has, but we are said to have risen with Him on account of the hope which we have
in Him. So again he says: "According to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration."
397 Evidently what we obtain in the washing of regeneration is not the salvation itself,
but the hope of it. And yet, because this hope is certain, we are said to be saved, as if the
salvation were already bestowed. Elsewhere it is said explicitly: "We groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope. But
hope which is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we
hope for what we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."398 The apostle says not, "we
are to be saved," but, "We are now saved," that is, in hope, though not yet in reality. And in
the same way it is in hope, though not yet in reality, that we now know no man after the
flesh. This hope is in Christ, in whom what we hope for as promised to us has already been
fulfilled. He is risen, and death has no more dominion over Him. Though we have known
Him after the flesh, before His death, when there was in His body that mortality which the
apostle properly calls flesh, now henceforth know we Him no more; for that mortal of His
has now put on immortality, and His flesh, in the sense of mortality, no longer exists.</p>
<p>8. The context of the passage containing this clause of which our adversaries make such
a bad use, brings out its real meaning. "The love of Christ," we read, "constrains us, because
we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that they which live
should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to Him who died for them, and rose again.
Therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; and though we have known Christ
after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more." The words, "that they which

<pb n="313"/>
live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for them, and rose
again," show plainly that the resurrection of Christ is the ground of the apostle’s statement.
To live not to themselves, but to Him, must mean to live not after the flesh, in the hope of
earthly and perishable goods, but after the spirit, in the hope of resurrection,—a resurrection
already accomplished in Christ. Of those, then, for whom Christ died and rose again, and
who live henceforth not to themselves, but to Him, the Apostle says that he knows no one
after the flesh, on account of the hope of future immortality to which they were looking
forward,—a hope which in Christ was already a reality. So, though he has known Christ
after the flesh, before His death, now he knows Him no more; for he knows that He has
risen, and that death has no more dominion over Him. And because in Christ we all are
even now in hope, though not in reality, what Christ is, he adds: "Therefore if any man be
in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
new. And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself by Christ."399 What the
new creature—that is, the people renewed by faith—hopes for regarding itself, it has already
in Christ; and the hope will also hereafter be actually realized. And, as regards this hope,
old things have passed away, because we are no longer in the times of the Old Testament,
expecting a temporal and carnal kingdom of God; and all things are become new, making
the promise of the kingdom of heaven, where there shall be no death or corruption, the
ground of our confidence. But in the resurrection of the dead it will not be as a matter of
hope, but in reality, that old things shall pass away, when the last enemy, death, shall be
destroyed; and all things shall become new when this corruptible has put on incorruption,
and this mortal has put on immortality. This has already taken place in Christ, whom Paul
accordingly, in reality, knew no longer after the flesh. But not yet in reality, but only in
hope, did he know no one after the flesh of those for whom Christ died and rose again. For,
as he says to the Ephesians, we are already saved by grace. The whole passage is to the
purpose: "But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even
when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we have
been saved." The words, "hath quickened us together with Christ," correspond to what he
said to the Corinthians, "that they which live should no longer live to themselves, but to
Him that died for them and rose again." And in the words, "by whose grace we have been
saved," he speaks of the thing hoped for as already accomplished. So, in the passage quoted
above, he says explicitly, "We have been saved by hope." And here he proceeds to specify
future events as if already accomplished. "And has raised us up together," he says, "and has
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Christ is certainly already seated
in heavenly places, but we not yet. But as in an assured hope we already possess the future,
he says that we sit in heavenly places, not in ourselves, but in Him. And to show that it is
<note type="footnote">399 2 Cor. v. 14-18.</note>

<pb n="314"/>
still future, in case it should be thought that what is spoken of as accomplished in hope has
been accomplished in reality, he adds, "that He might show in the ages to come the exceeding
riches of His grace in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus."400 So also we must understand
the following passage: "For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which
were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."401 He says,
"when we were in the flesh," as if they were no longer in the flesh. He means to say, when
we were in the hope of fleshly things, referring to the time when the law, which can be fulfilled
only by spiritual love, was in force, in order that by transgression the offence might abound,
that after the revelation of the New Testament, grace and the gift by grace might much more
abound. And to the same effect he says elsewhere, "They which are in the flesh cannot please
God;" and then, to show that he does not mean those not yet dead, he adds, "But ye are not
in the flesh, but in the Spirit."402 The meaning is, those who are in the hope of fleshly good
cannot please God; but you are not in the hope of fleshly things, but in the hope of spiritual
things, that is, of the kingdom of heaven, where the body itself, which now is natural, will,
by the change in the resurrection, be, according to the capacity of its nature, a spiritual
body. For "it is sown a natural body, it will be raised a spiritual body." If, then, the apostle
knew no one after the flesh of those who were said to be not in the flesh, because they were
not in the hope of fleshly things, although they still were burdened with corruptible and
mortal flesh; how much more significantly could he say of Christ that he no longer knew
Him after the flesh, seeing that in the body of Christ what they hoped for had already been
accomplished! Surely it is better and more reverential to examine the passages of sacred
Scripture so as to discover their agreement with one another, than to accept some as true,
and condemn others as false, whenever any difficulty occurs beyond the power of our weak
intellect to solve. As to the apostle in his childhood understanding as a child, this is said
merely as an illustration.403 And when he was a child he was not a spiritual man, as he was
when he produced for the edification of the churches those writings which are not, as other
books, merely a profitable study, but which authoritatively claim our belief as part of the
ecclesiastical canon.</p>

<p>Faustus denies that the prophets predicted Christ. Augustin proves such prediction from the
New Testament, and expounds at length the principal types of Christ in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Why do I not believe the prophets? Rather why do you believe them?
On account, you will reply, of their prophecies about Christ. For my part, I have read the
prophets with the most eager attention, and have found no such prophecies. And surely it
shows a weak faith not to believe in Christ without proofs and testimonies. Indeed, you
yourselves are accustomed to teach that Christian faith is so simple and absolute as not to
admit of laborious investigations. Why, then, should you destroy the simplicity of faith by
buttressing it with evidences, and Jewish evidences too? Or if you are changing your opinion
about evidences, what more trustworthy witness could you have than God Himself testifying
to His own Son when He sent Him on earth,—not by a prophet or an interpreter,—by a
voice immediately from heaven: "This is my beloved Son, believe Him?"404 And again He
testifies of Himself: "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world;"405 and in
many similar passages. When the Jews quarrelled with this testimony, saying "Thou bearest
witness of thyself, thy witness is not true," He replied: "Although I bear witness of myself,
my witness is true. It is written in your law, The witness of two men is true. I am one that
bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me."406 He does not
mention the prophets. Again He appeals to the testimony of His own works, saying, "If ye
believe not me, believe the works;"407 not, "If ye believe not me, believe the prophets." Accordingly
we require no testimonies concerning our Saviour. All we look for in the prophets
is prudence and virtue, and a good example, which, you are well aware, are not to be found
in the Jewish prophets. This, no doubt, explains your referring me at once to their predictions
as a reason for believing them, without a word about their actions. This may be good policy,
but it is not in harmony with the declaration of Scripture, that it is impossible to gather
grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. This may serve meanwhile as a brief and sufficient
reply to the question, why we do not believe the prophets. The fact that they did not
prophesy of Christ is abundantly proved in the writings of our fathers. I shall only add this,
that if the Hebrew prophets knew and preached Christ, and yet lived such vicious lives, what
Paul says of the wise men among the Gentiles might be applied to them: "Though they knew
God, they glorified Him not as God, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their ima-

ginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."408 You see the knowledge of great things
is worth little, unless the life corresponds.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: The meaning of all this is, that the Hebrew prophets foretold
nothing of Christ, and that, if they did, their predictions are of no use to us, and they
themselves did not live suitably to the dignity of such prophecies. We must therefore prove
the fact of the prophecies; and their use for the truth and steadfastness of our faith; and that
the lives of the prophets were in harmony with their words. In this threefold discussion, it
would take a long time under the first head to quote from all the books the passages in which
Christ may be shown to have been predicted. Faustus’ frivolity may be met effectually by
the weight of one great authority. Although Faustus does not believe the prophets, he professes
to believe the apostles. Above, as if to satisfy the doubts of some opponent, he declares
that he assuredly believes the Apostle Paul.409 Let us then hear what Paul says of the
prophets. His words are: "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated
unto the gospel of God, which He had promised before by His prophets in the holy Scriptures,
concerning His Son, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh."410 What
more does Faustus wish? Will he maintain that the apostle is speaking of some other
prophets, and not of the Hebrew prophets? In any case, the gospel spoken of as promised
was concerning the Son of God, who was made for Him of the seed of David according to
the flesh: and to this gospel the apostle says that he was separated. So that the Manichæan
heresy is opposed to faith in the gospel, which teaches that the Son of God was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh. Besides, there are many passages where the apostle
plainly testifies in behalf of the Hebrew prophets, with an authority by which the necks of
these proud Manichæans are broken.</p>
<p>3. "I speak the truth in Christ," says the apostle, "I lie not, my conscience bearing me
witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow of heart. For
I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my kinsmen according
to the flesh: who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the
covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service and the promises; whose are the fathers,
and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever."411
Here is the most abundant and express testimony and the most solemn commendation.
The adoption here spoken of is evidently through the Son of God; as the apostle says to the
Galatians: "In the fullness of time, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under
the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the ad-

option of sons."412 And the glory spoken of is chiefly that of which he says in the same
Epistle to the Romans: "What advantage hath the Jew? or what profit is there in circumcision?
Much every way: chiefly, because unto them were committed the oracles of God."413
Can the Manichæans tell us of any oracles of God committed to the Jews besides those of
the Hebrew prophets? And why are the covenants said to belong especially to the Israelites,
but because not only was the Old Testament given to them, but also the New was prefigured
in the Old? Our opponents often display much ignorant ferocity in attacking the dispensation
of the law given to the Israelites, not understanding that God wishes us to be not under the
law, but under grace. They are here answered by the apostle himself, who, in speaking of
the advantages of the Jews, mentions this as one, that they had the giving of the law. If the
law had been bad, the apostle would not have referred to it in praise of the Jews. And if
Christ had not been preached by the law, the Lord Himself would not have said, "If ye believe
Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me;"414 nor would He have borne the
testimony He did after His resurrection, saying, "All things must needs be fulfilled that were
written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me."415</p>
<p>4. But because the Manichæans preach another Christ, and not Him whom the apostles
preached, but a false Christ of their own false contrivance, in imitation of whose falsehood
they themselves speak lies, though they may perhaps be believed when they are not ashamed
to profess to be the followers of a deceiver, that has befallen them which the apostle asserts
of the unbelieving Jews: "When Moses is read, a veil is upon their heart." Neither will this
veil which keeps them from understanding Moses be taken away from them till they turn
to Christ; not a Christ of their own making, but the Christ of the Hebrew prophets. For, as
the apostle says, "When thou shalt turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away."416 We
cannot wonder that they do not believe in the Christ who rose from the dead, and who said,
"All things must needs be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the
prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me;" for this Christ has Himself told us what Abraham
said to a hard-hearted rich man when he was in torment in hell, and asked Abraham
to send some one to his brothers to teach them, that they might not come too into that place
of torment. Abraham’s reply was: "They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them."
And when the rich man said that they would not believe unless some one rose from the
dead, he received this most truthful answer: "If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
neither will they believe even though one rose from the dead."417 Wherefore, the Manichæans

<pb n="318"/>
will not hear Moses and the prophets, and so they do not believe Christ, though He rose
from the dead. Indeed, they do not even believe that Christ rose from the dead. For how
can they believe that He rose, when they do not believe that He died? For, again, how can
they believe that He died, when they deny that He had a mortal body?</p>
<p>5. But we reject those false teachers whose Christ is false, or rather, whose Christ never
existed. For we have a Christ true and truthful, foretold by the prophets, preached by the
apostles, who in innumerable places refer to the testimonies of the law and the prophets in
support of their preaching. Paul, in one short sentence, gives the right view of this subject.
"Now," he says, "the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed
by the law and the prophets."418 What prophets, if not of Israel, to whom, as he expressly
says, pertain the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the promises? And what promises,
but about Christ? Elsewhere, speaking of Christ, he says concisely: "All the promises of
God are in Him yea."419 Paul tells me that the giving of the law pertained to the Israelites.
He also tells me that Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
He also tells me that all the promises of God are in Christ yea. And you tell me that the
prophets of Israel foretold nothing of Christ. Shall I believe the absurdities of Manichæus
relating a vain and long fable in opposition to Paul? or shall I believe Paul when he forewarns
us: "If any man preach to you another gospel than that which we have preached, let him be
accursed?"</p>
<p>6. Our opponents may perhaps ask us to point out passages where Christ is predicted
by the prophets of Israel. One would think they might be satisfied with the authority of the
apostles, who declare that what we read in the writings of the Hebrew prophets was fulfilled
in Christ, or with that of Christ Himself, who says that these things were written of Him.
Whoever is unable to point out the passages should lay the blame on his own ignorance;
for the apostles and Christ and the sacred Scriptures are not chargeable with falsehood.
However, one instance out of many may be adduced. The apostle, in the verses following
the passage quoted above, says: "The word of God cannot fail. For they are not all Israel
which are of Israel; neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children:
but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: that is, they which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God; but the children of promise are counted for the seed."420 What
can our opponent say against this, in view of the declaration made to Abraham: "In thy
seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed?" At the time when the apostle gave the
following exposition of this promise, "To Abraham and to his seed were the promises made.
He saith not, To seed, as of many, but as of one, To thy seed, which is Christ,"421 a doubt

<note type="footnote">421 Gal. iii. 16.</note>

<pb n="319"/>
on this point might then have been less inexcusable, for at that time all nations had not yet
believed on Christ, who is preached as of the seed of Abraham. But now that we see the
fulfillment of what we read in the ancient prophecy,—now that all nations are actually
blessed in the seed of Abraham, to whom it was said thousands of years ago, "In thy seed
shall all nations be blessed,"—it is mere obstinate folly to try to bring in another Christ, not
of the seed of Abraham, or to hold that there are no predictions of Christ in the prophetical
books of the children of Abraham.</p>
<p>7. To enumerate all the passages in the Hebrew prophets referring to our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, would exceed the limits of a volume, not to speak of the brief replies of
which this treatise consists. The whole contents of these Scriptures are either directly or
indirectly about Christ. Often the reference is allegorical or enigmatical, perhaps in a verbal
allusion, or in a historical narrative, requiring diligence in the student, and rewarding him
with the pleasure of discovery. Other passages, again, are plain; for, without the help of
what is clear, we could not understand what is obscure. And even the figurative passages,
when brought together, will be found so harmonious in their testimony to Christ as to put
to shame the obtuseness of the sceptic.</p>
<p>8. In the creation God finished His works in six days, and rested on the seventh. The
history of the world contains six periods marked by the dealings of God with men. The first
period is from Adam to Noah; the second, from Noah to Abraham; the third, from Abraham
to David; the fourth, from David to the captivity in Babylon; the fifth, from the captivity to
the advent of lowliness of our Lord Jesus Christ; the sixth is now in progress, and will end
in the coming of the exalted Saviour to judgment. What answers to the seventh day is the
rest of the saints,—not in this life, but in another, where the rich man saw Lazarus at rest
while he was tormented in hell; where there is no evening, because there is no decay. On
the sixth day, in Genesis, man is formed after the image of God; in the sixth period of the
world there is the clear discovery of our transformation in the renewing of our mind, accord-
ing to the image of Him who created us, as the apostle says.422 As a wife was made for Adam
from his side while he slept, the Church becomes the property of her dying Saviour, by the
sacrament of the blood which flowed from His side after His death. The woman made out
of her husband’s side is called Eve, or Life, and the mother of living beings; and the Lord
says in the Gospel: "Except a man eat my flesh and drink my blood, he has no life in him."423
The whole narrative of Genesis, in the most minute details, is a prophecy of Christ and of
the Church with reference either to the good Christians or to the bad. There is a significance
in the words of the apostle when he calls Adam "the figure of Him that was to come;"424
<note type="footnote">422 Col. iii. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">423 John vi. 53.</note>
<note type="footnote">424 Rom. v. 14.</note>

<pb n="320"/>
and when he says, "A man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and
they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning Christ and the
Church."425 This points most obviously to the way in which Christ left His Father; for
"though He was in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, He
emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant."426 And so, too, He left His
mother, the synagogue of the Jews which cleaved to the carnality of the Old Testament, and
was united to the Church His holy bride, that in the peace of the New Testament they two
might be one flesh. For though with the Father He was God, by whom we were made, He
became in the flesh partaker of our nature, that we might become the body of which He is
the head.</p>
<p>9. As Cain’s sacrifice of the fruit of the ground is rejected, while Abel’s sacrifice of his
sheep and the fat thereof is accepted, so the faith of the New Testament praising God in the
harmless service of grace is preferred to the earthly observances of the Old Testament. For
though the Jews were right in practising these things, they were guilty of unbelief in not
distinguishing the time of the New Testament when Christ came, from the time of the Old
Testament. God said to Cain, "If thou offerest well, yet if thou dividest not well, thou hast
sinned."427 If Cain had obeyed God when He said, "Be content, for to thee shall be its reference,
and thou shalt rule over it," he would have referred his sin to himself, by taking the
blame of it, and confessing it to God; and so assisted by supplies of grace, he would have
ruled over his sin, instead of acting as the servant of sin in killing his innocent brother. So
also the Jews, of whom all these things are a figure, if they had been content, instead of being
turbulent, and had acknowledged the time of salvation through the pardon of sins by grace,
and heard Christ saying, "They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick;
I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;"428 and, "Every one that committeth
sin is the servant of sin;" and, "If the Son make you free, ye shall be free indeed,"429—they
would in confession have referred their sin to themselves, saying to the Physician, as it is
written in the Psalm, "I said, Lord, be merciful to me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against
Thee."430 And being made free by the hope of grace, they would have ruled over sin as long
as it continued in their mortal body. But now, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and
wishing to establish a righteousness of their own, proud of the works of the law, instead of
being humbled on account of their sins, they have not been content; and in subjection to

<pb n="321"/>
sin reigning in their mortal body, so as to make them obey it in the lusts thereof, they have
stumbled on the stone of stumbling, and have been inflamed with hatred against him whose
works they grieved to see accepted by God. The man who was born blind, and had been
made to see, said to them, "We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man serve
Him, and do His will, him He heareth;"431 as if he had said, God regardeth not the sacrifice
of Cain, but he regards the sacrifice of Abel. Abel, the younger brother, is killed by the elder
brother; Christ, the head of the younger people, is killed by the elder people of the Jews.
Abel dies in the field; Christ dies on Calvary.</p>
<p>10. God asks Cain where his brother is, not as if He did not know, but as a judge asks
a guilty criminal. Cain replies that he knows not, and that he is not his brother’s keeper.
And what answer can the Jews give at this day, when we ask them with the voice of God,
that is, of the sacred Scriptures, about Christ, except that they do not know the Christ that
we speak of? Cain’s ignorance was pretended, and the Jews are deceived in their refusal of
Christ. Moreover, they would have been in a sense keepers of Christ, if they had been willing
to receive and keep the Christian faith. For the man who keeps Christ in his heart does not
ask, like Cain, Am I my brother’s keeper? Then God says to Cain, "What hast thou done?
The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground." So the voice of God in
the Holy Scriptures accuses the Jews. For the blood of Christ has a loud voice on the earth,
when the responsive Amen of those who believe in Him comes from all nations. This is the
voice of Christ’s blood, because the clear voice of the faithful redeemed by His blood is the
voice of the blood itself.</p>
<p>11. Then God says to Cain: "Thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened its
mouth to receive thy brother’s blood at thy hand. For thou shalt till the earth, and it shall
no longer yield unto thee its strength. A mourner and an abject shalt thou be on the earth."
It is not, Cursed is the earth, but, Cursed art thou from the earth, which hath opened its
mouth to receive thy brother’s blood at thy hand. So the unbelieving people of the Jews is
cursed from the earth, that is, from the Church, which in the confession of sins has opened
its mouth to receive the blood shed for the remission of sins by the hand of the people that
would not be under grace, but under the law. And this murderer is cursed by the Church;
that is, the Church admits and avows the curse pronounced by the apostle: "Whoever are
of the works of the law are under the curse of the law."432 Then, after saying, Cursed art
thou from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood at thy hand,
what follows is not, For thou shalt till it, but, Thou shalt till the earth, and it shall not yield
to thee its strength. The earth he is to till is not necessarily the same as that which opened
its mouth to receive his brother’s blood at his hand. From this earth he is cursed, and so he
<note type="footnote">431 John ix. 31.</note>
<note type="footnote">432 Gal. iii. 10.</note>

<pb n="322"/>
tills an earth which shall no longer yield to him its strength. That is, the Church admits and
avows the Jewish people to be cursed, because after killing Christ they continue to till the
ground of an earthly circumcision, an earthly Sabbath, an earthly passover, while the hidden
strength or virtue of making known Christ, which this tilling contains, is not yielded to the
Jews while they continue in impiety and unbelief, for it is revealed in the New Testament.
While they will not turn to God, the veil which is on their minds in reading the Old Testament
is not taken away. This veil is taken away only by Christ, who does not do away with the
reading of the Old Testament, but with the covering which hides its virtue. So, at the crucifixion
of Christ, the veil was rent in twain, that by the passion of Christ hidden mysteries
might be revealed to believers who turn to Him with a mouth opened in confession to drink
His blood. In this way the Jewish people, like Cain, continue tilling the ground, in the carnal
observance of the law, which does not yield to them its strength, because they do not perceive
in it the grace of Christ. So too, the flesh of Christ was the ground from which by crucifying
Him the Jews produced our salvation, for He died for our offences. But this ground did not
yield to them its strength, for they were not justified by the virtue of His resurrection, for
He arose again for our justification. As the apostle says: "He was crucified in weakness, but
He liveth by the power of God." 433 This is the power of that ground which is unknown to
the ungodly and unbelieving. When Christ rose, He did not appear to those who had crucified
Him. So Cain was not allowed to see the strength of the ground which he tilled to sow
his seed in it; as God said, "Thou shalt till the ground, and it shall no longer yield unto thee
its strength."</p>
<p>12. "Groaning and trembling shalt thou be on the earth." Here no one can fail to see
that in every land where the Jews are scattered they mourn for the loss of their kingdom,
and are in terrified subjection to the immensely superior number of Christians. So Cain
answered, and said: "My case is worse, if Thou drivest me out this day from the face of the
earth, and from Thy face shall I be hid, and I shall be a mourner and an outcast on the earth;
and it shall be that every one that findeth me shall slay me." Here he groans indeed in terror,
lest after losing his earthly possession he should suffer the death of the body. This he calls
a worse case than that of the ground not yielding to him its strength, or than that of spiritual
death. For his mind is carnal; for he thinks little of being hid from the face of God, that is,
of being under the anger of God, were it not that he may be found and slain. This is the
carnal mind that tills the ground, but does not obtain its strength. To be carnally minded
is death; but he, in ignorance of this, mourns for the loss of his earthly possession, and is in
terror of bodily death. But what does God reply? "Not so," He says; "but whosoever shall
kill Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." That is, It is not as thou sayest; not
by bodily death shall the ungodly race of carnal Jews perish. For whoever destroys them in
<note type="footnote">433 2 Cor. xiii. 4.</note>

<pb n="323"/>
this way shall suffer sevenfold vengeance, that is, shall bring upon himself the sevenfold
penalty under which the Jews lie for the crucifixion of Christ. So to the end of the seven
days of time, the continued preservation of the Jews will be a proof to believing Christians
of the subjection merited by those who, in the pride of their kingdom, put the Lord to death.</p>
<p>13. "And the Lord God set a mark upon Cain, lest any one finding him should slay
him." It is a most notable fact, that all the nations subjugated by Rome adopted the heathenish
ceremonies of the Roman worship; while the Jewish nation, whether under Pagan or
Christian monarchs, has never lost the sign of their law, by which they are distinguished
from all other nations and peoples. No emperor or monarch who finds under his government
the people with this mark kills them, that is, makes them cease to be Jews, and as Jews to be
separate in their observances, and unlike the rest of the world. Only when a Jew comes over
to Christ, he is no longer Cain, nor goes out from the presence of God, nor dwells in the
land of Nod, which is said to mean commotion. Against this evil of commotion the
Psalmist prays, "Suffer not my feet to be moved;"434 and again, "Let not the hands of the
wicked remove me;"435 and, "Those that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved:"436 and,
"The Lord is at my right hand, that I should not be moved;"437 and so in innumerable places.
This evil comes upon those who leave the presence of God, that is, His loving-kindness.
Thus the Psalmist says, "I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved." But observe what
follows, "Lord, by Thy favor Thou hast given strength to my honor; Thou didst hide Thy
face, and I was troubled;"438 which teaches us that not in itself, but by participation in the
light of God, can any soul possess beauty, or honor, or strength. The Manichæans should
think of this, to keep them from the blasphemy of identifying themselves with the nature
and substance of God. But they cannot think, because they are not content. The Sabbath
of the heart they are strangers to. If they were content, as Cain was told to be, they would
refer their sin to themselves; that is, they would lay the blame on themselves, and not on a
race of darkness that no one ever heard of, and so by the grace of God they would prevail
over their sin. But now the Manichæans, and all who oppose the truth by their various
heresies, leave the presence of God, like Cain and the scattered Jews, and inhabit the land
of commotion, that is, of carnal disquietude, instead of the enjoyment of God, that is instead
of Eden, which is interpreted Feasting, where Paradise was planted. But not to depart too
much from the argument of this treatise I must limit myself to a few, short remarks under
this head.</p>

<p>14. Omitting therefore many passages in these Books where Christ may be found, but
which require longer explanation and proof, although the most hidden meanings are the
sweetest, convincing testimony may be obtained from the enumeration of such things as
the following:—That Enoch, the seventh from Adam, pleased God, and was translated, as
there is to be a seventh day of rest into which all will be translated who, during the sixth day
of the world’s history, are created anew by the incarnate Word. That Noah, with his family
is saved by water and wood, as the family of Christ is saved by baptism, as representing the
suffering of the cross. That this ark is made of beams formed in a square, as the Church is
constructed of saints prepared unto every good work: for a square stands firm on any side.
That the length is six times the breadth, and ten times the height, like a human body, to
show that Christ appeared in a human body. That the breadth reaches to fifty cubits; as the
apostle says, "Our heart is enlarged,"439 that is, with spiritual love, of which he says again,
"The love of God is shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us."440
For in the fiftieth day after His resurrection, Christ sent His Holy Spirit to enlarge the hearts
of His disciples. That it is three hundred cubits long, to make up six times fifty; as there are
six periods in the history of the world during which Christ has never ceased to be
preached,—in five foretold by the prophets, and in the sixth proclaimed in the gospel. That
it is thirty cubits high, a tenth part of the length; because Christ is our height, who in his
thirtieth year gave His sanction to the doctrine of the gospel, by declaring that He came not
to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. Now the ten commandments are to be the heart of the
law; and so the length of the ark is ten times thirty. Noah himself, too, was the tenth from
Adam. That the beams of the ark are fastened within and without with pitch, to signify by
compact union the forbearance of love, which keeps the brotherly connection from being
impaired, and the bond of peace from being broken by the offences which try the Church
either from without or from within. For pitch is a glutinous substance, of great energy and
force, to represent the ardor of love which, with great power of endurance, beareth all things
in the maintenance of spiritual communion.</p>
<p>15. That all kinds of animals are inclosed in the ark; as the Church contains all nations,
which was also set forth in the vessel shown to Peter. That clean and unclean animals are
in the ark; as good and bad take part in the sacraments of the Church. That the clean are
in sevens, and the unclean in twos; not because the bad are fewer than the good, but because
the good preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; and the Spirit is spoken of in
Scripture as having a sevenfold operation, as being "the Holy Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
of counsel and might, of knowledge and piety, and of the fear of God."441 So also
<note type="footnote">439 2 Cor. vi. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">440 Rom. v. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">441 Isa. xi. 2, 3.</note>

<pb n="325"/>
the number fifty, which is connected with the advent of the Holy Spirit, is made up of seven
times seven, and one over; whence it is said, "Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in
the bond of peace."442 The bad, again, are in twos, as being easily divided, from their tendency
to schism. That Noah, counting his family, was the eighth; because the hope of our
resurrection has appeared in Christ, who rose from the dead on the eighth day, that is, on
the day after the seventh, or Sabbath day. This day was the third from His passion; but in
the ordinary reckoning of days, it is both the eighth and the first.</p>
<p>16. That the whole ark together is finished in a cubit above; as the Church, the body of
Christ gathered into unity, is raised to perfection. So Christ says in the Gospel: "He that
gathereth not with me, scattereth."443 That the entrance is on the side; as no man enters
the Church except by the sacrament of the remission of sins which flowed from Christ’s
opened side. That the lower spaces of the ark are divided into two and three chambers: as
the multitude of all nations in the Church is divided into two, as circumcised and uncircumcised;
or into three, as descended from the three sons of Noah. And these parts of the ark
are called lower, because in this earthly state there is a difference of races, and above we are
completed in one. Above there is no diversity; for Christ is all and in all, finishing us, as it
were, in one cubit above with heavenly unity.</p>
<p>17. That the flood came seven days after Noah entered the ark; as we are baptized in
the hope of the future rest, which was denoted by the seventh day. That all flesh on the face
of the earth, outside the ark, was destroyed by the flood; as, beyond the communion of the
Church, though the water of baptism is the same, it is efficacious only for destruction, and
not for salvation. That it rained for forty days and forty nights; as the sacrament of heavenly
baptism washes away all the guilt of the sins against the ten commandments throughout all
the four quarters of the world (four times ten is forty), whether that guilt has been contracted
in the day of prosperity or in the night of adversity.</p>
<p>18. That Noah was five hundred years old when God told him to make the ark, and six
hundred when he entered the ark; which shows that the ark was made during one hundred
years, which seem to correspond to the years of an age of the world. So the sixth age is occupied
with the construction of the Church by the preaching of the gospel. The man who
avails himself of the offer of salvation is made like a square beam, fitted for every good work,
and forms part of the sacred fabric. Again, it was the second month of the six hundredth
year when Noah entered the ark, and in two months there are sixty days; so that here, as in
every multiple of six, we have the number denoting the sixth age.</p>
<p>19. That mention is made of the twenty seventh day of the month; as we have already
seen the significance of the square in the beams. Here especially it is significant; for as
<note type="footnote">442 Eph. iv. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">443 Matt. xii. 30.</note>

<pb n="326"/>
twenty-seven is the cube of three, there is a trinity in the means by which we are, as it were,
squared, or fitted for every good work. By the memory we remember God; by the understanding
we know Him; by the will we love Him. That in the seventh month the ark rested;
reminding us again of the seventh day of rest. And here again, to denote the perfection of
those at rest, the twenty-seventh day of the month is mentioned for the second time. So
what is promised in hope is realized in experience. There is here a combination of seven
and eight; for the water rose fifteen cubits above the mountains, pointing to a profound
mystery in baptism,—the sacrament of our regeneration. For the seventh day of rest is
connected with the eighth of resurrection. For when the saints receive again their bodies
after the rest of the intermediate state, the rest will not cease; but rather the whole man,
body and soul united, renewed in the immortal health, will attain to the realization of his
hope in the enjoyment of eternal life. Thus the sacrament of baptism, like the waters of
Noah, rises above all the wisdom of the proud. Seven and eight are also combined in the
number of one hundred and fifty, made up of seventy and eighty, which was the number
of days during which the water prevailed, pointing out the deep import of baptism in consecrating
the new man to hold the faith of rest and resurrection.</p>
<p>20. That the raven sent out after forty days did not return, being either prevented by
the water or attracted by some floating carcase; as men defiled by impure desire, and
therefore eager for things outside in the world, are either baptized, or are led astray into the
company of those to whom, as they are outside the ark, that is, outside the Church, baptism
is destructive. That the dove when sent forth found no rest, and returned; as in the New
Testament rest is not promised to the saints in this world. The dove was sent forth after
forty days, a period denoting the length of human life. When again sent forth after seven
days, denoting the sevenfold operation of the Spirit, the dove brought back a fruitful olive
branch; as some even who are baptized outside of the Church, if not destitute of the fatness
of charity, may come after all, as it were in the evening, and be brought into the one communion
by the mouth of the dove in the kiss of peace. That, when again sent forth after
seven days, the dove did not return; as, at the end of the world, the rest of the saints shall
no longer be in the sacrament of hope, as now, while in the communion of the Church, they
drink what flowed from the side of Christ, but in the perfection of eternal safety, when the
kingdom shall be delivered up to God and the Father, and when, in that unclouded contemplation
of unchangeable truth, we shall no longer need natural symbols.</p>
<p>21. There are many other points which we cannot take notice of even in this cursory
manner. Why in the six hundred and first year of Noah’s life—that is, after six hundred
years were completed—the covering of the ark is removed, and the hidden mystery, as it
were, disclosed. Why the earth is said to have dried on the twenty-seventh day of the second
month; as if the number fifty-seven denoted the completion of the rite of baptism. For the
twenty-seventh day of the second month is the fifty-seventh day of the year; and the number

<pb n="327"/>
fifty-seven is seven times eight, which are the numbers of the spirit and the body, with one
over, to denote the bond of unity. Why they leave the ark together, though they entered
separately. For it is said: "Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with
him, into the ark;" the men and the women being spoken of separately; which denotes the
time when the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. But they go
forth, Noah and his wife, and his sons and their wives,—the men and women together. For
in the end of the world, and in the resurrection of the just, the body will be united to the
spirit in perfect harmony, undisturbed by the wants and the passions of mortality. Why,
after leaving the ark, only clean animals are offered in sacrifice to God, though both clean
and unclean were in the ark.</p>
<p>22. Then, again, it is significant that when God speaks to Noah, and begins anew, as it
were, in order, by repetition in various forms, to draw attention to the figure of the Church,
the sons of Noah are blessed, and told to replenish the earth, and all animals are given to
them for food; as was said to Peter of the vessel, "Kill and eat." That they are told to pour
out the blood when they eat; that the former life may not be kept shut up in the conscience,
but may be, as it were, poured out in confession. That God makes the bow, which appears
in the clouds only when the sun shines, the sign of His covenant with men, and with every
living thing, that He will not destroy them with a flood; as those do not perish by the flood,
in separation from the Church, who in the clouds of God—that is, in the prophets and in
all the sacred Scriptures—discern the glory of Christ, instead of seeking their own glory.
The worshippers of the sun, however, need not pride themselves on this; for they must understand
that the sun, as also a lion, a lamb, and a stone, are used as types of Christ because
they have some resemblance, not because they are of the same substance.</p>
<p>23. Again, the sufferings of Christ from His own nation are evidently denoted by Noah
being drunk with the wine of the vineyard he planted, and his being uncovered in his tent.
For the mortality of Christ’s flesh was uncovered, to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the
Greeks foolishness; but to them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, both Shem and
Japhet, the power of God and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser
than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.444</p>
<p>Moreover, the two sons, the eldest and the youngest, carrying the garment backwards,
are a figure of the two peoples, and the sacrament of the past and completed passions of the
Lord. They do not see the nakedness of their father, because they do not consent to Christ’s
death; and yet they honor it with a covering, as knowing whence they were born. The middle
son is the Jewish people, for they neither held the first place with the apostles, nor believed
subsequently with the Gentiles. They saw the nakedness of their father, because they consented
to Christ’s death; and they told it to their brethren outside, for what was hidden in
<note type="footnote">444 1 Cor. i. 23-25.</note>

<pb n="328"/>
the prophets was disclosed by the Jews. And thus they are the servants of their brethren.
For what else is this nation now but a desk for the Christians, bearing the law and the
prophets, and testifying to the doctrine of the Church, so that we honor in the sacrament
what they disclose in the letter?</p>
<p>24. Again, every one must be impressed, and be either enlightened or confirmed in the
faith, by the blessing of the two sons who honored the nakedness of their father, though
they turned away their faces, as displeased with the evil done by the vine. "Blessed," he says,
"be the Lord God of Shem." For although God is the God of all nations, even the Gentiles
acknowledge Him to be in a peculiar sense the God of Israel. And how is this to be explained
but by the blessing of Japhet? The occupation of all the world by the Church among the
Gentiles was exactly foretold in the words: "Let God enlarge Japhet, and let him dwell in
the tents of Shem." That is for the Manichæan to attend to. You see what the state of the
world actually is. The very thing that you are astonished and grieved at in us is this, that
God is enlarging Japhet. Is He not dwelling in the tents of Shem?—that is, in the churches
built by the apostles, the sons of the prophets. Hear what Paul says to the believing Gentiles:
"Ye were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants; having no hope of the promise, and without God in the world."
In these words there is a description of the state of Japhet before he dwelt in the tents of
Shem. But observe what follows: "Now then;" he says, "ye are no more strangers and foreigners,
but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God, being built upon
the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone."
445 Here we have Japhet enlarged, and dwelling in the tents of Shem. These testimonies
are taken from the epistles of the apostles, which you yourselves acknowledge, and read,
and profess to follow. You occupy an unhappy middle position in a building of which Christ
is not the chief corner-stone. For you do not belong to the wall of those who, like the apostles,
being of the circumcision, believed in Christ; nor to the wall of those who, being of the uncircumcision,
like all the Gentiles, are joined in the unity of faith, as in the fellowship of the
corner-stone. However, all who accept and read any books of our canon in which Christ is
spoken of as having been born and having suffered in the flesh, and who do not unite with
us in a common veiling with the sacrament of the mortality, uncovered by the passion, but
without the knowledge of piety and charity make known that from which we all are
born,—although they differ among themselves, whether as Jews and heretics, or as heretics
of one kind or other,—are still all useful to the Church, as being all alike servants, either in
bearing witness to or in proving some truth. For of heretics it is said: "There must be heresies,
that those who are approved among you may be manifested."446 Go on, then, with
<note type="footnote">445 Eph. ii. 12, 19, 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">446 1 Cor. xi. 19.</note>

<pb n="329"/>
your objections to the Old Testament Scriptures! Go on, ye servants of Ham! You have
despised the flesh from which you were born when uncovered. For you could not have
called yourselves Christians unless Christ had come into the world, as foretold by the
prophets, and had drunk of His own vine that cup which could not pass from Him, and had
slept in His passion, as in the drunkenness of the folly which is wiser than men; and so, in
the hidden counsel of God, the disclosure had been made of that infirmity of mortal flesh
which is stronger than men. For unless the Word of God had taken on Himself this infirmity,
the name of Christian, in which you also glory, would not exist in the earth. Go on, then,
as I have said. Declare in mockery what we may honor with reverence. Let the Church use
you as her servants to make manifest those members who are approved. So particular are
the predictions of the prophets regarding the state and the sufferings of the Church, that
we can find a place even for you in what is said of the destructive error by which the reprobate
are to perish, while the approved are to be manifested.</p>
<p>25. You say that Christ was not foretold by the prophets of Israel, when, in fact, their
Scriptures teem with such predictions, if you would only examine them carefully, instead
of treating them with levity. Who in Abraham leaves his country and kindred that he may
become rich and prosperous among strangers, but He who, leaving the land and country
of the Jews, of whom He was born in the flesh, is now extending His power, as we see, among
the Gentiles? Who in Isaac carried the wood for His own sacrifice, but He who carried His
own cross? Who is the ram for sacrifice, caught by the horns in a. bush, but He who was
fastened to the cross as an offering for us?</p>
<p>26. Who in the angel striving with Jacob, on the one hand is constrained to give him a
blessing, as the weaker to the stronger, the conquered to the conqueror, and on the other
hand puts his thigh-bone out of joint, but He who, when He suffered the people of Israel to
prevail against Him, blessed those among them who believed, while the multitude, like Jacob’s
thigh-bone, halted in their carnality? Who is the stone placed under Jacob’s head, but Christ
the head of man? And in its anointing the very name of Christ is expressed, for, as all know,
Christ means anointed. Christ refers to this in the Gospel, and declares it to be a type of
Himself, when He said of Nathanael that he was an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile,
and when Nathanael, resting his head, as it were, on this Stone, or on Christ, confessed Him
as the Son of God and the King of Israel anointing the Stone by his confession, in which he
acknowledged Jesus to be Christ. On this occasion the Lord made appropriate mention of
what Jacob saw in his dream "Verily I say unto you, Ye shall see heaven opened, and the
angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."447 This Jacob saw, who in
the blessing was called Israel, when he had the stone for a pillow, and had the vision of the
ladder reaching from earth to heaven, on which the angels of God were ascending and des-
<note type="footnote">447 John i. 47-51.</note>

<pb n="330"/>
cending.448 The angels denote the evangelists, or preachers of Christ. They ascend when
they rise above the created universe to describe the supreme majesty of the divine nature of
Christ as being in the beginning God with God, by whom all things were made. They descend
to tell of His being made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that
were under the law. Christ is the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, or from the carnal
to the spiritual: for by His assistance the carnal ascend to spirituality; and the spiritual may
be said to descend to nourish the carnal with milk when they cannot speak to them as to
spiritual, but as to carnal.449 There is thus both an ascent and a descent upon the Son of
man. For the Son of man is above as our head, being Himself the Saviour; and He is below
in His body, the Church. He is the ladder, for He says, "I am the way." We ascend to Him
to see Him in heavenly places; we descend to Him for the nourishment of His weak members.
And the ascent and descent are by Him as well as to Him. Following His example, those
who preach Him not only rise to behold Him exalted, but let themselves down to give a
plain announcement of the truth. So the apostle ascends, "Whether we be beside ourselves,
it is to God;" and descends, "Whether we be sober, it is for your sake." And by whom did
he ascend and descend? "For the love of Christ constraineth us: for we thus judge, that if
one died for all, then all died; and that He died for all, that they which live should no longer
live unto themselves, but unto Him that died for them, and rose again." 450</p>
<p>27. The man who does not find pleasure in these views of sacred Scripture is turned
away to fables, because he cannot bear sound doctrine. The fables have an attraction for
childish minds in people of all ages; but we who are of the body of Christ should say with
the Psalmist; "O Lord, the wicked have spoken to me pleasing things, but they are not after
Thy law."451 In every page of these Scriptures, while I pursue my search as a son of Adam
in the sweat of my brow, Christ either openly or covertly meets and refreshes me. Where
the discovery is laborious my ardor is increased, and the spoil obtained is eagerly devoured,
and is hidden in my heart for my nourishment.</p>
<p>28. Christ appears to me in Joseph, who was persecuted and sold by his brethren, and
after his troubles obtained honor in Egypt. We have seen the troubles of Christ in the world,
of which Egypt was a figure, in the sufferings of the martyrs. And now we see the honor of
Christ in the same world which He subdues to Himself, in exchange for the food which He
bestows. Christ appears to me in the rod of Moses, which became a serpent when cast on
the earth as a figure of His death, which came from the serpent. Again, when caught by the
tail it became a rod, as a figure of His return after the accomplishment of His work in His
<note type="footnote">448 Gen. xxviii. 11-18.</note>
<note type="footnote">449 1 Cor. iii. 1-3.</note>
<note type="footnote">450 2 Cor. v. 13-15.</note>
<note type="footnote">451 Ps. cxix. 83.</note>

<pb n="331"/>
resurrection to what He was before, destroying death by His new life, so as to leave no trace
of the serpent. We, too, who are His body, glide along in the same mortality through the
folds of time; but when at last the tail of this course of things is laid hold of by the hand of
judgment that it shall go no further, we shall be renewed, and rising from the destruction
of death, the last enemy, we shall be the sceptre of government in the right hand of God.</p>
<p>29. Of the departure of Israel from Egypt, let us hear what the apostle himself says: "I
would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant that all our fathers were under the cloud,
and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink of the same spiritual drink. For
they drank of the spiritual rock which followed them, and that rock was Christ." 452 The
explanation of one thing is a key to the rest. For if the rock is Christ from its stability, is not
the manna Christ, the living bread which came down from heaven, which gives spiritual
life to those who truly feed on it? The Israelites died because they received the figure only
in its carnal sense. The apostle, by calling it spiritual food, shows its reference to Christ, as
the spiritual drink is explained by the words, "That rock was Christ," which explain the
whole. Then is not the cloud and the pillar Christ, who by His uprightness and strength
supports our feebleness; who shines by night and not by day, that they who see not may see,
and that they who see may be made blind? In the clouds and the Red Sea there is the baptism
consecrated by the blood of Christ. The enemies following behind perish, as past sins are
put away.</p>
<p>30. The Israelites are led through the wilderness, as those who are baptized are in the
wilderness while on the way to the promised land, hoping and patiently waiting for that
which they see not. In the wilderness are severe trials, lest they should in heart return to
Egypt. Still Christ does not leave them; the pillar does not go away. The bitter waters are
sweetened by wood, as hostile people become friendly by learning to honor the cross of
Christ. The twelve fountains watering the seventy palm trees are a figure of apostolic grace
watering the nations. As seven is multiplied by ten, so the decalogue is fulfilled in the sevenfold
operation of the Spirit. The enemy attempting to stop them in their way is overcome
by Moses stretching out his hands in the figure of the cross. The deadly bites of serpents
are healed by the brazen serpent, which was lifted up that they might look at it. The Lord
Himself gives the explanation of this: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so
must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but have
everlasting life."453 So in many other things we may find a protest against the obstinacy of
unbelieving hearts. In the passover a lamb is killed, representing Christ, of whom it is said
in the Gospel, "Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world!"454 In the
<note type="footnote">452 1 Cor. x. 1-4.</note>
<note type="footnote">453 John iii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">454 John i. 29.</note>

<pb n="332"/>
passover the bones of the lamb were not to be broken; and on the cross the bones of the
Lord were not broken. The evangelist, in reference to this, quotes the words, "A bone of
Him shall not be broken."455 The posts were marked with blood to keep away destruction,
as people are marked on their foreheads with the sign of the Lord’s passion for their salvation.
The law was given on the fiftieth day after the passover; so the Holy Spirit came on the
fiftieth day after the passion of the Lord. The law is said to have been written with the finger
of God; and the Lord says of the Holy Spirit, "With the finger of God I cast out devils."456
Such are the Scriptures in which Faustus, after shutting his eyes, declares that he can see no
prediction of Christ. But we need not wonder that he should have eyes to read and yet no
heart to understand, since, instead of knocking in devout faith at the door of the heavenly
secret, he dares to act in profane hostility. So let it be, for so it ought to be. Let the gate of
salvation be shut to the proud. The meek, to whom God teaches His ways, will find all these
things in the Scriptures, and those things which he does not see he will believe from what
he sees.</p>
<p>31. He will see Jesus leading the people into the land of promise; for this name was
given to the leader of Israel, not at first, or by chance, but on account of the work to which
he was called. He will see the cluster from the land of promise hanging from a wooden
pole. He will see in Jericho, as in this perishing world, an harlot, one of those of whom the
Lord says that they go before the proud into the kingdom of heaven, putting out of her
window a scarlet line symbolical of blood, as confession is made with the mouth for the remission
of sins. He will see the walls of Jericho, like the frail defences of the world, fall when
compassed seven times by the ark of the covenant; as now in the course of the seven days
of time the covenant of God compasses the whole globe, that in the end, death, the last enemy,
may be destroyed, and the Church, like one single house, be saved from the destruction of
the ungodly, purified from the defilement of fornication by the window of confession in the
blood of remission.</p>
<p>32. He will see the times of the judges precede those of the kings, as the judgment will
precede the kingdom. And under both the judges and the kings he will see Christ and the
Church repeatedly prefigured in many and various ways. Who was in Samson, when he
killed the lion that met him as he went to get a wife among strangers, but He who, when
going to call His Church from among the Gentiles, said, "Be of good cheer, I have overcome
the world?" 457 What means the hive in the mouth of the slain lion, but that, as we see, the

very laws of the earthly kingdom which once raged against Christ have now lost their
fierceness, and have become a protection for the preaching of gospel sweetness? What is
that woman boldly piercing the temples of the enemy with a wooden nail, but the faith of
the Church casting down the kingdom of the devil by the cross of Christ? What is the fleece
wet while the ground was dry, and again the fleece dry while the ground was wet, but the
Hebrew nation at first possessing alone in its typical institution Christ the mystery of God,
while the whole world was in ignorance? And now the whole world has this mystery revealed,
while the Jews are destitute of it.</p>
<p>33. To mention only a few things in the times of the kings, at the very outset does not
the change in the priesthood when Eli was rejected and Samuel chosen, and in the kingdom
when Saul was rejected and David chosen, clearly predict the new priesthood and kingdom
to come in our Lord Jesus Christ, when the old, which was a shadow of the new, was rejected?
Did not David, when he ate the shew-bread, which it was not lawful for any but the priests
to eat, prefigure the union of the kingdom and priesthood in one person, Jesus Christ? In
the separation of the ten tribes from the temple while two were left, is there not a figure of
what the apostle asserts of the whole nation: "A remnant is saved by the election of grace."?458
34. In the time of famine, Elijah is fed by ravens bringing bread in the morning and
flesh in the evening; but the Manichæans cannot in this perceive Christ, who, as it were,
hungers for our salvation, and to whom sinners come in confession, having now the firstfruits
of the Spirit, while in the end, that is to say in the evening of the age, they will have
the resurrection of their bodies also. Elijah is sent to be fed by a widow woman of another
nation, who was going to gather two sticks before she died, denoting the two wooden beams
of the cross. Her meal and oil are blessed, as the fruit and cheerfulness of charity do not
diminish by expenditure, for God loveth a cheerful giver.459</p>
<p>35. The children that mocked Elisha by calling out Baldhead, are devoured by wild
beasts, as those who in childish folly scoff at Christ crucified on Calvary are destroyed by
devils. Elisha sends his servants to lay his staff on the dead body, but it does not revive; he
comes himself, and lays himself exactly upon the dead body, and it revives: as the Word of
God sent the law by His servant, without any profit to mankind dead in sins; and yet it was
not sent without purpose by Him who knew the necessity of its being first sent. Then He
Himself came, conformed Himself to us by participation in our death, and we were revived.
When they were cutting down wood with axes, the iron, flying off the wood, sank to the
bottom of the river, and came up again when the wood was thrown in by Elisha. So, when
Christ’s bodily presence was cutting down the unfruitful trees among the unbelieving Jews,
according to the saying of John, "Behold, the axe is laid to the roots of the tree,"460 by the

<pb n="334"/>
death they inflicted, Christ was separated from His body, and descended to the depths of
the infernal world; and then, when His body was laid in the tomb, like the wood on the
water, His spirit returned, like the iron to the handle, and He rose. The reader will observe
how many things of this kind are omitted for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p>36. As regards the departure to Babylon, where the Spirit of God by the prophet
Jeremiah enjoins them to go, telling them to pray for the people in whose land they dwell
as strangers, because in their peace they would find peace, and to build houses, and plant
vineyards and gardens,—the figurative meaning is plain, when we consider that the true
Israelites, in whom is no guile, passed over in the ministry of the apostles with the ordinances
of the gospel into the kingdom of the Gentiles. So the apostle, like an echo of Jeremiah, says
to us, "I will first of all that prayer, supplications, intercessions and giving of thanks be made
for all men, and for those in authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and charity; for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who
will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth."461 Accordingly
the basilicas of Christian congregations have been built by believers as abodes of peace, and
vineyards of the faithful have been renewed, and gardens planted, where chief among the
plants is the mustard tree, in whose wide-spreading branches the pride of the Gentiles, like
the birds of heaven, in its soaring ambition, takes shelter. Again, in the return from captivity
after seventy years, according to Jeremiah’s prophecy, and in the restoration of the temple,
every believer in Christ must see a figure of our return as the Church of God from the exile
of this world to the heavenly Jerusalem, after the seven days of time have fulfilled their
course. Joshua the high priest, after the captivity, who rebuilt the temple, was a figure of
Jesus Christ, the true High Priest of our restoration. The prophet Zechariah saw this Joshua
in a filthy garment; and after the devil who stood by to accuse him was defeated, the filthy
garment was taken from him, and a dress of honor and glory given him. So the body of Jesus
Christ, which is the Church, when the adversary is conquered in the judgment at the end
of the world, will pass from the pains of exile to the glory of everlasting safety. This is the
song of the Psalmist at the dedication of his house: "Thou hast turned for me my mourning
into gladness; Thou hast removed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness, that my glory
may sing praise unto Thee, and not be silent." 462</p>
<p>37. It is impossible, in a digression like this, to refer, however briefly, to all the figurative
predictions of Christ which are to be found in the law and the prophets. Will it be said that
these things happened in the regular course of things, and that it is a mere ingenious fancy
to make them typical of Christ? Such an objection might come from Jews and Pagans; but
those who wish to be considered Christians must yield to the authority of the apostle when
<note type="footnote">461 1 Tim. ii. 1-4.</note>
<note type="footnote">462 Ps. xxx. 11, 12.</note>

<pb n="335"/>
he says, "All these things happened to them for an example;" and again, "These things are
our examples."463 For if two men, Ishmael and Isaac, are types of the two covenants, can it
be supposed that there is no significance in the vast number of particulars which have no
historical or natural value? Suppose we were to see some Hebrew characters written on the
wall of a noble building, should we be so foolish as to conclude that, because we cannot
understand the characters, they are not intended to be read, and are mere painting, without
any meaning? So, whoever with a candid mind reads all these things that are contained in
the Old Testament Scriptures, must feel constrained to acknowledge that they have a
meaning.</p>
<p>38. As an example of those particulars which have no meaning at all if not a symbolical
one: Granting that it was necessary that woman should be made as an help meet for man,
what natural reason can be assigned for her being taken from his side while he slept?
Granting that an ark was required in order to escape from the flood, why should it have
precisely these dimensions, and why should they be recorded for the devout study of future
generations? Granting that the animals were brought into the ark to preserve the various
races, why should there be seven clean and two unclean? Granting that the ark must have
a door, why should it be in the side, and why should this fact be committed to writing?
Abraham is commanded to sacrifice his son: we may allow that this proof of his obedience
was required in order to make it conspicuous in all ages; we may allow, too, that it was a
proper thing for the son to carry the wood instead of the aged father, and that in the end
the fatal stroke was forbidden, lest the father should be left childless. But what had the
shedding of the ram’s blood to do with Abraham’s trial? or if it was necessary to complete
the sacrifice, was the ram any the better of being caught by the horns in a bush? The human
mind, that is to say, a rational mind, is led by the consideration of the way in which these
apparently superfluous things are blended with what is necessary, first to acknowledge their
significance, and then to try to discover it.</p>
<p>39. The Jews themselves, who scoff at the crucified Saviour in whom we believe, and
who consequently will not allow that Christ is predicted in the sayings and actions recorded
in the Old Testament, are compelled to come to us for an explanation of those things which,
if not explained, must appear trifling and ridiculous. This led Philo, a Jew of great learning,
whom the Greeks speak of as rivalling Plato in eloquence, to attempt to explain some things
without any reference to Christ, in whom he did not believe. His attempt only shows the
inferiority of all ingenious speculations, when made without keeping Christ in view, to
whom all the predictions really point. So true is that saying of the apostle: "When they shall
turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away."464 For instance, Noah’s ark is, according to
<note type="footnote">463 1 Cor. x. 10, 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">464 2 Cor. iii. 16.</note>

<pb n="336"/>
Philo, a type of the human body, member by member: with this view, he shows that the
numerical proportions agree perfectly. For there is no reason why a type of Christ should
not be a type of the human body, too, since the Saviour of mankind appeared in a human
body, though what is typical of a human body is not necessarily typical of Christ. Philo’s
explanation fails, however, as regards the door in the side of the ark. He actually, for the
sake of saying something, makes this door represent the lower apertures of the body. He
has the hardihood to put this in words, and on paper. Indeed, he knew not the door and
could not understand the symbol. Had he turned to Christ the veil would have been taken
away, and he would have found the sacraments of the Church flowing from the side of
Christ’s human body. For, according to the announcement, "They two shall be one flesh,"
some things in the ark which is a type of Christ, refer to Christ, and some to the Church.
This contrast between the explanations which keep Christ in view, and all other ingenious
perversions, is the same in every particular of all the figures in Scripture.</p>
<p>40. The Pagans, too, cannot deny our right to give a figurative meaning to both words
and things, especially as we can point to the fulfillment of the types and figures. For the
Pagans themselves try to find in their own fables figures of natural and religious truth.
Sometimes they give clear explanations, while at other times they disguise their meaning,
and what is sacred in the temples becomes a jest in the theatres. They unite a disgraceful
licentiousness to a degrading superstition.</p>
<p>41. Besides this wonderful agreement between the types and the things typified, the
adversary may be convinced by plain prophetic intimations, such as this: "In thy seed shall
all nations be blessed." This was said to Abraham,465 and again to Isaac,466 and again to
Jacob.467 Hence the significance of the words "I am the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob."468 God fulfills His promise to their seed in blessing all nations. With a like significance,
Abraham himself, when he made his servant swear, told him to put his hand under
his thigh;469 for he knew that thence would come the flesh of Christ, in whom we have now,
not the promise of blessing to all nations, but the promise fulfilled.</p>
<p>42. I should like to know, or rather, it would be well not to know, with what blindness
of mind Faustus reads the passage where Jacob calls his sons, and says, "Assemble, that I
may tell you the things that are to happen in the last day. Assemble and hear, ye sons of
Jacob; give ear to Israel, your father." Surely these are the words of a prophet. What, then,
does he say of his son Judah, of whose tribe Christ came of the seed of David according to

the flesh, as the apostle teaches? "Judah," he says, "thy brethren shall praise thee: thy hand
shall be upon the backs of thine enemies; the sons of thy father shall bow down to thee.
Judah is a lion’s whelp; my son and offspring: bowing down, thou hast gone up: thou
sleepest as a lion, and as a young lion, who will rouse him up? A prince shall not depart
from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till those things come which have been laid up for
him. He also is the desire of nations: binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt with
sackcloth, he shall wash his garment in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: his eyes
are bright with wine, and his teeth whiter than milk."470 There is no falsehood or obscurity
in these words when we read them in the clear light of Christ. We see His brethren the
apostles and all His joint-heirs praising Him, seeking, not their own glory, but His. We see
His hands on the backs of His enemies, who are bent and bowed to the earth by the growth
of the Christian communities in spite of their opposition. We see Him worshipped by the
sons of Jacob, the remnant saved according to the election of grace. Christ, who was born
as an infant, is the lion’s whelp, as it is added, My son and offspring, to show why this whelp,
in whose praise it is said, "The lion’s whelp is stronger than the herd,"471 is even in infancy
stronger than its elders. We see Christ ascending the cross, and bowing down when He
gave up His spirit. We see Him sleeping as a lion, because in death itself He was not the
conquered, but the conqueror, and as a lion’s whelp; for the reason of His birth and of His
death was the same. And He is raised from the dead by Him whom no man hath seen or
can see; for the words, "Who will raise Him up?" point to an unknown power. A prince did
not depart from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till in due time those things came which
had been laid up in the promise. For we learn from the authentic history of the Jews themselves,
that Herod, under whom Christ was born, was their first foreign king. So the sceptre
did not depart from the seed of Judah till the things laid up for him came. Then, as the
promise is not only to the believing Jews, it is added: "He is the desire of the nations." Christ
bound His foal—that is, His people—to the vine, when He preached in sackcloth, crying,
"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." The Gentiles made subject to Him are
represented by the ass’s colt, on which He also sat, leading it into Jerusalem, that is, the
vision of peace teaching the meek His ways. We see Him washing His garments in wine;
for He is one with the glorious Church, which He presents to Himself, not having spot or
wrinkle; to whom also it is said by Isaiah: "Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them
white as snow."472 How is this done but by the remission of sins? And the wine is none
other than that of which it is said that it is "shed for many, for the remission of sins." Christ

<pb n="338"/>
is the cluster that hung on the pole. So it is added, "and His clothes in the blood of the
grape." Again, what is said of His eyes being bright with wine, is understood by those
members of His body who are enabled, in holy aberration of mind from the current of
earthly things, to gaze on the eternal light of wisdom. So Paul says in a passage quoted before:
"If we be beside ourselves, it is to God." Those are the eyes bright with wine. But he adds:
"If we be sober, it is for your sakes." The babes needing to be fed with milk are not forgotten,
as is denoted by the words, "His teeth are whiter than milk."</p>
<p>43. What can our deluded adversaries say to such plain examples, which leave no room
for perverse denial, or even for sceptical uncertainty? I call on the Manichæans to begin to
inquire into these subjects, and to admit the force of these evidences, on which I have no
time to dwell; nor do I wish to make a selection, in case the ignorant reader should think
there are no others, while the Christian student might blame me for the omission of many
points more striking than those which occur to me at the moment. You will find many
passages which require no such explanation as has been given here of Jacob’s prophecy.
For instance, every reader can understand the words, "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter,"
and the whole of that plain prophecy, "With His stripes we are healed"—"He bore our
sins."473 We have a poetical gospel in the words: "They pierced my hands and feet. They
have told all my bones. They look and stare upon me. They divided my garments among
them, and cast lots on my vesture."474 The blind even may now see the fulfillment of the
words: "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord, and all kingdoms
of the nations shall worship before Him." The words in the Gospel, "My soul is sorrowful,
even unto death," "My soul is troubled," are a repetition of the words in the Psalm, "I slept
in trouble."475 And who made Him sleep? Whose voices cried, Crucify him, crucify him?
The Psalm tells us: "The sons of men, their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a
sharp sword."476 But they could not prevent His resurrection, or His ascension above the
heavens, or His filling the earth with the glory of His name; for the Psalm says: "Be Thou
exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let Thy glory be above all the earth." Every one must
apply these words to Christ: "The Lord said unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
Thee. Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession."477 And what Jeremiah says of wisdom
plainly applies to Christ: "Jacob delivered it to his son, and Israel to his chosen one. Afterwards
He appeared on earth, and conversed with men."478</p>

<p>44. The same Saviour is spoken of in Daniel, where the Son of man appears before the
Ancient of days, and receives a kingdom without end, that all nations may serve Him.479
In the passage quoted from Daniel by the Lord Himself, "When ye shall see the abomination
of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, let him that
readeth understand,"480 the number of weeks points not only to Christ, but to the very time
of His advent. With the Jews, who look to Christ for salvation as we do, but deny that He
has come and suffered, we can argue from actual events. Besides the conversion of the
heathen, now so universal, as prophesied of Christ in their own Scriptures, there are the
events in the history of the Jews themselves. Their holy place is thrown down, the sacrifice
has ceased, and the priest, and the ancient anointing; which was all clearly foretold by Daniel
when he prophesied of the anointing of the Most Holy.481 Now, that all these things have
taken place, we ask the Jews for the anointed Most Holy, and they have no answer to give.
But it is from the Old Testament that the Jews derive all the knowledge they have of Christ
and His advent. Why do they ask John whether he is Christ? Why do they say to the Lord,
"How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly." Why do Peter
and Andrew and Philip say to Nathanael, "We have found Messias, which is interpreted
Christ," but because this name was known to them from the prophecies of their Scriptures?
In no other nation were the kings and priests anointed, and called Anointed or Christs.
Nor could this symbolical anointing be discontinued till the coming of Him who was thus
prefigured. For among all their anointed ones the Jews looked for one who was to save
them. But in the mysterious justice of God they were blinded; and thinking only of the
power of the Messiah, they did not understand His weakness, in which He died for us. In
the book of Wisdom it is prophesied of the Jews: "Let us condemn him to an ignominious
death; for he will be proved in his words. If he is truly the Son of God, He will aid him; and
deliver him from the hand of his enemies. Thus they thought, and erred; for their wickedness
blinded them."482 These words apply also to those who, in spite of all these evidences, in
spite of such a series of prophecies, and of their fulfillment, still deny that Christ is foretold
in the Scriptures. As often as they repeat this denial, we can produce fresh proofs, with the
help of Him who has made such provision against human perversity, that proofs already
given need not be repeated.</p>
<p>45. Faustus has an evasive objection, which he no doubt thinks a most ingenious way
of eluding the force of the clearest evidence of prophecy, but of which one is unwilling to
take any notice, because answering it may give it an appearance of importance which it does

not really possess. What could be more irrational than to say that it is weak faith which will
not believe in Christ without evidence? Do our adversaries, then, believe in testimony about
Christ? Faustus wishes us to believe the voice from heaven as distinguished from human
testimony. But did they hear this voice? Has not the knowledge of it come to us through
human testimony? The apostle describes the transmission of this knowledge, when he says:
"How shall they call on Him on whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe
on Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and
how shall they preach except they be sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of
them who publish peace, who bring good tidings!"483 Clearly, in the preaching of the apostles
there was a reference to prophetic testimony. The apostles quoted the predictions of the
prophets, to prove the truth and importance of their doctrines. For although their preaching
was accompanied with the power of working miracles, the miracles would have been ascribed
to magic, as some even now venture to insinuate, unless the apostles had shown that the
authority of the prophets was in their favor. The testimony of prophets who lived so long
before could not be ascribed to magical arts. Perhaps the reason why Faustus will not have
us believe the Hebrew prophets as witnesses of the true Christ, is because he believes Persian
heresies about a false Christ.</p>
<p>46. According to the teaching of the Catholic Church, the Christian mind must first be
nourished in simple faith, in order that it may become capable of understanding things
heavenly and eternal. Thus it is said by the prophet: "Unless ye believe, ye shall not understand."
484 Simple faith is that by which, before we attain to the height of the knowledge of
the love of Christ, that we may be filled with all the fullness of God, we believe that not
without reason was the dispensation of Christ’s humiliation, in which He was born and
suffered as man, foretold so long before by the prophets through a prophetic race, a
prophetic people, a prophetic kingdom. This faith teaches us, that in the foolishness which
is wiser than men, and in the weakness which is stronger than men, is contained the hidden
means of our justification and glorification. There are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge, which are opened to no one who despises the nourishment transmitted through
the breast of his mother that is, the milk of apostolic and prophetic instruction; or who,
thinking himself too old for infantile nourishment, devours heretical poison instead of the
food of wisdom, for which he rashly thought himself prepared. To require simple faith is
quite consistent with requiring faith in the prophets. The very use of simple faith is to believe
the prophets at the outset, while the understanding of the person who speaks in the prophets
is attained after the mind has been purified and strengthened.</p>
<note type="footnote">483 Rom. x. 14, 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">484 Isa. vii. 9 (Vulg.).</note>

<pb n="341"/>
<p>47. But, it is said, if the prophets foretold Christ, they did not live in a way becoming
their office. How can you tell whether they did or not? You are bad judges of what it is to
live well or ill, whose justice consists in giving relief to an inanimate melon by eating it, instead
of giving food to the starving beggar. It is enough for the babes in the Catholic Church,
who do not yet know the perfect justice of the human soul, and the difference between the
justice aimed at and that actually attained, to think of those men according to the wholesome
doctrine of the apostles, that the just lives by faith. "Abraham believed God, and it was
counted to him for righteousness. For the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
Gentiles by faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all
nations be blessed."485 These are the words of the apostle. If you would, at his clear wellknown
voice, wake up from your unprofitable dreams, you would follow in the footsteps
of our father Abraham, and would be blessed, along with all nations, in his seed. For, as the
apostle says, "He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith
which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all that believe in
uncircumcision; that he might be the father of circumcision not only to those who are of
the circumcision, but also to those who follow the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham
in uncircumcision."486 Since the righteousness of Abraham’s faith is thus set forth as an
example to us, that we too, being justified by faith, may have peace with God, we ought to
understand his manner of life, without finding fault with it; lest, by a premature separation
from mother-Church, we prove abortions, instead of being brought forth in due time, when
the conception has arrived at completeness.</p>
<p>48. This is a brief reply to Faustus in behalf of the character of the patriarchs and
prophets. It is the reply of the babes of our faith, among whom I would reckon myself,
inasmuch as I would not find fault with the life of the ancient saints, even if I did not understand
its mystical character. Their life is proclaimed to us with approval by the apostles in
their Gospel, as they themselves in their prophecy foretold the future apostles, that the two
Testaments, like the seraphim, might cry to one another, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
of hosts."487 When Faustus, instead of the vague general accusation which he makes here,
condemns particular actions in the lives of the patriarchs and the prophets, the Lord their
God, and ours also, will assist me to reply suitably and appropriately to the separate charges.
For the present, the reader must choose whether to believe the commendation of the Apostle
Paul or the accusations of Faustus the Manichæan.488</p>

Augustin shows the value of prophesy for Gentiles and Jews alike.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: We are asked how we worship Christ when we reject the prophets,
who declared the promise of His advent. It is doubtful whether, on examination, it can be
shown that the Hebrew prophets foretold our Christ, that is, the Son of God. But were it
so, what does it matter to us? If these testimonies of the prophets that you speak of were
the means of converting any one from Judaism to Christianity, and if he should afterwards
neglect these prophets, he would certainly be in the wrong, and would be chargeable with
ingratitude. But we are by nature Gentiles, of the uncircumcision; as Paul says, born under
another law. Those whom the Gentiles call poets were our first religious teachers, and from
them we were afterwards converted to Christianity. We did not first become Jews, so as to
reach Christianity through faith in their prophets; but were attracted solely by the fame,
and the virtues, and the wisdom of our liberator Jesus Christ. If I were still in the religion
of my fathers, and a preacher were to come using the prophets as evidence in favor of
Christianity, I should think him mad for attempting to support what is doubtful by what is
still more doubtful to a Gentile of another religion altogether. He would require first to
persuade me to believe the prophets, and then through the prophets to believe Christ. And
to prove the truth of the prophets, other prophets would be necessary. For if the prophets
bear witness to Christ, who bears witness to the prophets? You will perhaps say that Christ
and the prophets mutually support each other. But a Pagan, who has nothing to do with
either, would believe neither the evidence of Christ to the prophets, nor that of the prophets
to Christ. If the Pagan becomes a Christian, he has to thank his own faith, and nothing else.
Let us, for the sake of illustration, suppose ourselves conversing with a Gentile inquirer.
We tell him to believe in Christ, because He is God. He asks for proof. We refer him to the
prophets. He asks, What prophets? We reply, The Hebrew. He smiles, and says that he
does not believe them. We remind him that Christ testifies to them. He replies, laughing,
that we must first make him believe in Christ. The result of such a conversation is that we
are silenced, and the inquirer departs, thinking us more zealous than wise. Again, I say, the
Christian Church, which consists more of Gentiles than of Jews, can owe nothing to Hebrew
witnesses. If, as is said, any prophecies of Christ are to be found in the Sibyl,489 or in Her-
<note type="footnote">489 [On the Sibylline books, see article by G. H. Schodde in the Schaff-Hertzog Encyclopædia of Religious
Knowledge, and the works there referred to. The Christian writers of the first three centuries seem not to have</note>

mes,490 called Trismegistus, or Orpheus, or any heathen poet, they might aid the faith of
those who, like us, are converts from heathenism to Christianity. But the testimony of the
Hebrews is useless to us before conversion, for then we cannot believe them; and superfluous
after, for we believe without them.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: After the long reply of last book, a short answer may suffice here.
To one who has read that reply, it must seem insanity in Faustus to persist in denying that
Christ was foretold by the Hebrew prophets, when the Hebrew nation was the only one in
which the name Christ had a peculiar sacredness as applied to kings and priests; in which
sense it continued to be applied till the coming of Him whom those kings and priests typified.
Where did the Manichæan learn the name of Christ? If from Manichæus, it is very strange
that Africans, not to speak of others, should believe the Persian Manichæus, since Faustus
finds fault with the Romans and Greeks, and other Gentiles, for believing the Hebrew
prophets as belonging to another race. According to Faustus, the predictions of the Sibyl,
or Orpheus, or any heathen poet, are more suitable for leading Gentiles to believe in Christ.
He forgets that none of these are read in the churches, whereas the voice of the Hebrew
prophets, sounding everywhere, draws swarms of people to Christianity. When it is so
evident that men are everywhere led to Christ by the Hebrew prophets, it is great absurdity
to say that those prophets are not suitable for the Gentiles.</p>
<p>3. Christ as foretold by the Hebrew prophets does not please you; but this is the Christ
in whom the Gentile nations believe, with whom, according to you, Hebrew prophecy should
have no weight. They receive the gospel which, as Paul says, "God had promised before by
His prophets in the Holy Scriptures of His Son, who was made of the seed of David according
to the flesh."491 So we read in Isaiah: "There shall be a Root of Jesse, which shall rise to
reign in the nations; in Him shall the Gentiles trust."492 And again: "Behold, a virgin shall

<note type="footnote">490 ["The Mercurius or Hermes Trismegistus of legend was a personage, an Egyptian sage or succession of
sages, who, since the time of Plato, has been identified with the Thoth (the name of the month September), of

of the Egyptian priesthood. He was by several of the Fathers, and, in modern times, by three of his earliest editors,
supposed to have existed before the time of Moses, and to have obtained the appellation of ‘Thrice greatest’,
from his threefold learning and rank of Philosopher, Priest and King, and that of ‘Hermes,’ or Mercurius, as
messenger and authoritative interpreter of divine things." The author of the books that go under the name of

conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,"493 which is, being interpreted,
God with us. Nor let the Manichæan think that Christ is foretold only as a man by
the Hebrew prophets; for this is what Faustus seems to insinuate when he says, "Our Christ
is the Son of God," as if the Christ of the Hebrews was not the Son of God. We can prove
Christ the virgin’s son of Hebrew prophecy to be God. For the Lord Himself teaches the
carnal Jews not to think that, because He is foretold as the son of David, He is therefore no
more than that. He asks: "What think ye of Christ? Whose son is He?" They reply: "Of
David." Then, to remind them of the name Emmanuel, God with us, He says: "How does
David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right
hand, till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool?"494 Here, then, Christ appears as God in
Hebrew prophecy. What prophecy can the Manichæans show with the name of Christ in
it?</p>
<p>4. Manichæus indeed was not a prophet of Christ, but calls himself an apostle, which
is a shameless falsehood; for it is well known that this heresy began not only after Tertullian,
but after Cyprian. In all his letters Manichæus begins thus: "Manichæus, an apostle of Jesus
Christ." Why do you believe what Manichæus says of Christ? What evidence does he give
of his apostleship? This very name of Christ is known to us only from the Jews, who, in
their application of it to their kings and priests, were not individually, but nationally,
prophets of Christ and Christ’s kingdom. What right has he to use this name, who forbids
you to believe the Hebrew prophets, that he may make you the heretical disciples of a false
Christ, as he himself is a false and heretical apostle? And if Faustus quotes as evidence in
his own support some prophets who, according to him, foretell Christ, how will he satisfy
his supposed inquirer, who will not believe either the prophets or Faustus? Will he take our
apostles as witnesses? Unless he can find some apostles in life, he must read their writings;
and these are all against him. They teach our doctrine that Christ was born of the Virgin
Mary, that He was the Son of God, of the seed of David according to the flesh. He cannot
pretend that the writings have been tampered with, for that would be to attack the credit of
his own witnesses. Or if he produces his own manuscripts of the apostolic writings, he must
also obtain for them the authority of the churches founded by the apostles themselves, by
showing that they have been preserved and transmitted with their sanction. It will be difficult
for a man to make me believe him on the evidence of writings which derive all their authority
from his own word, which I do not believe.</p>
<p>5. But perhaps you believe the common report about Christ. Faustus makes a feeble
suggestion of this kind as a last resource, to escape being obliged either to produce his
worthless authorities, or to come under the power of those opposed to him. Well, if report
<note type="footnote">493 Isa. vii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">494 Matt. xxii. 42-44.</note>

<pb n="346"/>
is your authority, you should consider the consequences of trusting to such evidence. There
are many bad things reported of you which you do not wish people to believe. Is it reasonable
to make the same evidence true about Christ and false about yourselves? In fact, you deny
the common report about Christ. For the report most widely spread, and which every one
has heard repeated, is that which distinctly asserts that Christ was born of the seed of David,
according to the promise made in the Hebrew Scriptures to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob:
"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed." You will not admit this Hebrew testimony, but
you do not seem to have any other. The authority of our books, which is confirmed by the
agreement of so many nations, supported by a succession of apostles, bishops, and councils,
is against you. Your books have no authority, for it is an authority maintained by only a
few, and these the worshippers of an untruthful God and Christ. If they are not following
the example of the beings they worship, their testimony must be against their own false
doctrine. And, once more, common report gives a very bad account of you, and invariably
asserts, in opposition to you, that Christ was of the seed of David. You did not hear the
voice of the Father from heaven. You did not see the works by which Christ bore witness
to Himself. The books which tell of these things you profess to receive, that you may
maintain a delusive appearance of Christianity; but when anything is quoted against you,
you say that the books have been tampered with. You quote the passage where Christ says,
"If ye believe not me, believe the works;" and again, "I am one that bear witness of myself,
and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me;" but you will not let us quote in reply
such passages as these: "Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think that ye have eternal life,
and they are they that testify of me;" "If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me, for he wrote
of me;" "They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them;" "If they hear not Moses
and the prophets, neither will they believe though one rose from the dead." What have you
to say for yourselves? Where is your authority? If you reject these passages of Scripture, in
spite of the weighty authority in their favor, what miracles can you show? However, if you
did work miracles, we should be on our guard against receiving their evidence in your case;
for the Lord has forewarned us: "Many false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall
do many signs and wonders, that they may deceive, if it were possible, the very elect: behold,
I have told you before." 495 This shows that the established authority of Scripture must
outweigh every other; for it derives new confirmation from the progress of events which
happen, as Scripture proves, in fulfillment of the predictions made so long before their occurrence.</p>
<p>6. Are, then, your doctrines so manifestly true, that they require no support from miracles
or from any testimony? Show us these self-evident truths, if you have anything of the
kind to show. Your legends, as we have already seen, are long and silly, old wives fables for
<note type="footnote">495 Matt. xxiv. 24, 25.</note>

<pb n="347"/>
the amusement of women and children. The beginning is detached from the rest, the middle
is unsound, and the end is a miserable failure. If you begin with the immortal, invisible,
incorruptible God, what need was there of His fighting with the race of darkness? And as
for the middle of your theory, what becomes of the incorruptibility and unchangeableness
of God, when His members in fruits and vegetables are purified by your mastication and
digestion? And for the end, is it just that the wretched soul should be punished with lasting
confinement in the mass of darkness, because its God is unable to cleanse it of the defilement
contracted from evil external to itself in the fulfillment of His own commission? You are
at a loss for a reply. See the worthlessness of your boasted manuscripts, numerous and
valuable as you say they are! Alas for the toils of the antiquaries! Alas for the property of
the unhappy owners! Alas for the food of the deluded followers! Destitute as you are of
Scripture authority, of the power of miracles, of moral excellence, and of sound doctrine,
depart ashamed, and return penitent, confessing that true Christ, who is the Saviour of all
who believe in Him, whose name and whose Church are now displayed as they were of old
foretold, not by some being issuing from subterranean darkness, but by a nation in a distinct
kingdom established for this purpose, that there those things might be figuratively predicted
of Christ which are now in reality fulfilled, and the prophets might foretell in writing what
the apostles now exhibit in their preaching.</p>
<p>7. Let us suppose, then, a conversation with a heathen inquirer, in which Faustus described
us as making a poor appearance, though his own appearance was much more deplorable.
If we say to the heathen, Believe in Christ, for He is God, and, on his asking for
evidence, produce the authority of the prophets, if he says that he does not believe the
prophets, because they are Hebrew and he is a Gentile, we can prove the truth of the
prophets from the actual fulfillment of their prophecies. He could scarcely be ignorant of
the persecutions suffered by the early Christians from the kings of this world; or if he was
ignorant, he could be informed from history and the records of imperial laws. But this is
what we find foretold long ago by the prophet, saying, "Why do the heathen rage, and the
people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the princes take
counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ." The rest of the Psalm shows that
this is not said of David. For what follows might convince the most stubborn unbeliever:
"The Lord said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and
I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession."
496 This never happened to the Jews, whose king, David was, but is now plainly fulfilled
in the subjection of all nations to the name of Christ. This and many similar prophecies,
which it would take too long to quote, would surely impress the mind of the inquirer. He
would see these very kings of the earth now happily subdued by Christ, and all nations
<note type="footnote">496 Ps. ii. 7, 8.</note>

<pb n="348"/>
serving Him; and he would hear the words of the Psalm in which this was so long before
predicted: "All the kings of the earth shall bow down to Him; all nations shall serve Him."497
And if he were to read the whole of that Psalm, which is figuratively applied to Solomon,
he would find that Christ is the true King of peace, for Solomon means peaceful; and he
would find many things in the Psalm applicable to Christ, which have no reference at all to
the literal King Solomon. Then there is that other Psalm where God is spoken of as anointed
by God, the very word anointed pointing to Christ, showing that Christ is God, for God is
represented as being anointed.498 In reading what is said in this Psalm of Christ and of the
Church, he would find that what is there foretold is fulfilled in the present state of the world.
He would see the idols of the nations perishing from off the earth, and he would find that
this is predicted by the prophets, as in Jeremiah, "Then shall ye say unto them, The gods
that have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth, and from under
heaven;"499 and again, "O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of
affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto Thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely
our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. Shall a man
make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? Therefore, behold, I will at that time cause
them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know
that I am the Lord." 500 Hearing these prophecies, and seeing their actual fulfillment, I need
not say that he would be affected; for we know by experience how the hearts of believers are
confirmed by seeing ancient predictions now receiving their accomplishment.</p>
<p>8. In the same prophet the inquirer would find clear proof that Christ is not merely
one of the great men that have appeared in the world. For Jeremiah goes on to say: "Cursed
be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from
the Lord: for he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh;
but shall inhabit the parched places of the wilderness, in a salt land not inhabited. Blessed
is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is: for he shall be as a tree
beside the water, that spreadeth out its roots by the river: he shall not fear when heat cometh,
but his leaf shall be green; he shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease
from yielding fruit."501 On hearing this curse pronounced in the figurative language of
prophecy on him that trusts in man, and the blessing in similar style on him that trusts in
God, the inquirer might have doubts about our doctrine, in which we teach not only that
<note type="footnote">497 Ps. lxxii. 10.</note>

<note type="footnote">499 Jer. x. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">500 Jer. xvi. 19-21.</note>
<note type="footnote">501 Jer. xvii. 5-8.</note>

<pb n="349"/>
Christ is God, so that our trust is not in man, but also that He is man because He took our
nature. So some err by denying Christ’s humanity, while they allow His divinity. Others,
again, assert His humanity, but deny His divinity, and so either become infidels or incur
the guilt of trusting in man. The inquirer, then, might say that the prophet says only that
Christ is God, without any reference to His human nature; whereas, in our apostolic doctrine,
Christ is not only God in whom we may safely trust, but the Mediator between God and
man—the man Jesus. The prophet explains this in the words in which he seems to check
himself, and to supply the omission: "His heart," he says "is sorrowful throughout; and He
is man, and who shall know Him?"502 He is man, in order that in the form of a servant He
might heal the hard in heart, and that they might acknowledge as God Him who became
man for their sakes, that their trust might be not in man, but in God-man. He is man taking
the form of a servant. And who shall know Him? For "He was in the form of God, and
thought it not robbery to be equal to God."503 He is man, for "the Word was made flesh,
and dwelt among us." And who shall know Him? For "in the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God."504 And truly His heart was sorrowful
throughout. For even as regards His own disciples His heart was sorrowful, when He said,
"Have I been so long time with you, and yet have ye not known me?" "Have I been so long
time with you" answers to the words "He is man," and "Have ye not known me?" to "Who
shall know Him?" And the person is none other but He who says, "He that hath seen me
hath seen the Father."505 So that our trust is not in man, to be under the curse of the
prophet, but in God-man, that is, in the Son of God, the Saviour Jesus Christ, the Mediator
between God and man. In the form of a servant the Father is greater than He; in the form
of God He is equal with the Father.</p>
<p>9. In Isaiah we read: "The pride of man shall be brought low; and the Lord alone shall
be exalted in that day. And they shall hide the workmanship of their hands in the clefts of
the rocks, and in dens and caves of the earth, from fear of the Lord, and from the glory of
His power, when He shall arise to shake terribly the earth. For in that day a man shall cast
away his idols of gold and silver, which they have made to worship, as useless and hurtful."
506 Perhaps the inquirer himself, who, as Faustus supposes, would laugh and say that he
does not believe the Hebrew prophets, has hid idols made with hands in some cleft, or cave,
or den. Or he may know a friend, or neighbor, or fellow-citizen who has done this from
the fear of the Lord, who by the severe prohibition of the kings of the earth, now serving

<pb n="350"/>
and bowing down to him, as the prophet predicted, shakes the earth, that is, breaks the
stubborn heart of worldly men. The inquirer is not likely to disbelieve the Hebrew prophets,
when he finds their predictions fulfilled, perhaps in his own person.</p>
<p>10. One might rather fear that the inquirer, in the midst of such copious evidence,
would say that the Christians composed those writings when the events described had
already begun to take place, in order that those occurrences might appear to be not due to
a merely human purpose, but as if divinely foretold. One might fear this, were it not for the
widely spread and widely known people of the Jews; that Cain, with the mark that he should
not be killed by any one; that Ham, the servant of his brethren, carrying as a load the books
for their instruction. From the Jewish manuscripts we prove that these things were not
written by us to suit the event, but were long ago published and preserved as prophecies in
the Jewish nation. These prophecies are now explained in their accomplishment: for even
what is obscure in them—because these things happened to them as an example, and were
written for our benefit, on whom the ends of the world are come—is now made plain; and
what was hidden in the shadows of the future is now visible in the light of actual experience.</p>
<p>11. The inquirer might bring forward as a difficulty the fact that those in whose books
these prophecies are found are not united with us in the gospel. But when convinced that
this also is foretold, he would feel how strong the evidence is. The prophecies of the unbelief
of the Jews no one can avoid seeing, no one can pretend to be blind to them. No one can
doubt that Isaiah spoke of the Jews when he said, "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass
his master’s crib; but Israel hath not known, and my people hath not considered;"507 or
again, in the words quoted by the apostle, "I have stretched out my hands all the day to a
wicked and gainsaying people;"508 and especially where he says, "God has given them the
spirit of remorse, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, and
should not understand,"509 and many similar passages. If the inquirer objected that it was
not the fault of the Jews if God blinded them so that they did not know Christ, we should
try in the simplest manner possible to make him understand that this blindness is the just
punishment of other secret sins known to God. We should prove that the apostle recognizes
this principle when he says of some persons, "God gave them up to the lusts of their own
hearts, and to a reprobate mind, to do things not convenient;"510 and that the prophets
themselves speak of this. For, to revert to the words of Jeremiah, "He is man, and who shall
know Him?" lest it should be an excuse for the Jews that they did not know,—for if they had
known, as the apostle says, "they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,"511—the

<pb n="351"/>
prophet goes on to show that their ignorance was the result of secret criminality; for he
says: "I the Lord search the heart and try the reins, to give to every one according to his
ways, and according to the fruits of his doings."</p>
<p>12. If the next difficulty in the mind of the inquirer arose from the divisions and heresies
among those called Christians, he would learn that this too is taken notice of by the prophets.
For, as if it was natural that, after being satisfied about the blindness of the Jews, this objection
from the divisions among Christians should occur, Jeremiah, observing this order in his
prophecy, immediately adds in the passage already quoted: "The partridge is clamorous,
gathering what it has not brought forth, making riches without judgment." For the partridge
is notoriously quarrelsome, and is often caught from its eagerness in quarreling. So the
heretics discuss not to find the truth, but with a dogged determination to gain the victory
one way or another, that they may gather, as the prophet says, what they have not brought
forth. For those whom they lead astray are Christians already born of the gospel, whom the
Christian profession of the heretics misleads. Thus they make riches not with judgment,
but with inconsiderate haste. For they do not consider that the followers whom they gather
as their riches are taken from the genuine original Christian society, and deprived of its
benefits; and as the apostle describes these heretics in the words: "As Jannes and Jambres
withstood Moses, so they also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning
the faith. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as
theirs also was."512 So the prophet goes on to say of the partridge, which gathers what it
has not brought forth: "In the midst of his days they shall leave him, and in the end he shall
be a fool;" that is, he who at first misled people by a promising display of superior wisdom,
shall be a fool, that is, shall be seen to be a fool. He will be seen when his folly is manifest
to all men, and to those to whom he was at first a wise man he will then be a fool.</p>
<p>13. As if anticipating that the inquirer would ask next by what plain mark a young
disciple, not yet able to distinguish the truth among so many errors, might find the true
Church of Christ, since the clear fulfillment of so many predictions compelled him to believe
in Christ, the prophet answers this question in what follows, and teaches that the Church
of Christ, which he describes prophetically, is conspicuously visible. His words are: "A
glorious high throne is our sanctuary."513 This glorious throne is the Church of which the
apostle says: "The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."514 The Lord also, foreseeing
the conspicuousness of the Church as a help to young disciples who might be misled, says,
"A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid."515 Since, then, a glorious high throne is our

<pb n="352"/>
sanctuary, no attention is to be paid to those who would lead us into sectarianism, saying,
"Lo, here is Christ," or "Lo there." Lo here, lo there, speaks of division; but the true city is
on a mountain, and the mountain is that which, as we read in the prophet Daniel, grew from
a little stone till it filled the whole earth.516 And no attention should be paid to those who,
professing some hidden mystery confined to a small number, say, Behold, He is in the
chamber; behold, in the desert: for a city set on an hill cannot be hid, and a glorious high
throne is our sanctuary.</p>
<p>14. After considering these instances of the fulfillment of prophecy about kings and
people acting as persecutors, and then becoming believers, about the destruction of idols,
about the blindness of the Jews, about their testimony to the writings which they have preserved,
about the folly of heretics, about the dignity of the Church of true and genuine
Christians, the inquirer would most reasonably receive the testimony of these prophets
about the divinity of Christ. No doubt, if we were to begin by urging him to believe
prophecies yet unfulfilled, he might justly answer, What have I to do with these prophets,
of whose truth I have no evidence? But, in view of the manifest accomplishment of so many
remarkable predictions, no candid person would despise either the things which were
thought worthy of being predicted in those early times with so much solemnity, or those
who made the predictions. To none can we trust more safely, as regards either events long
past or those still future, than to men whose words are supported by the evidence of so many
notable predictions having been fulfilled.</p>
<p>15. If any truth about God or the Son of God is taught or predicted in the Sibyl or Sibyls,
or in Orpheus, or in Hermes, if there ever was such a person, or in any other heathen poets,
or theologians, or sages, or philosophers, it may be useful for the refutation of Pagan error,
but cannot lead us to believe in these writers. For while they spoke, because they could not
help it, of the God whom we worship, they either taught their fellow-countrymen to worship
idols and demons, or allowed them to do so without daring to protest against it. But our
sacred writers, with the authority and assistance of God, were the means of establishing and
preserving among their people a government under which heathen customs were condemned
as sacrilege. If any among this people fell into idolatry or demon-worship, they were either
punished by the laws, or met by the awful denunciations of the prophets. They worshipped
one God, the maker of heaven and earth. They had rites; but these rites were prophetic, or
symbolical of things to come, and were to cease on the appearance of the things signified.
The whole state was one great prophet, with its king and priest symbolically anointed which
was discontinued, not by the wish of the Jews themselves, who were in ignorance through
unbelief, but only on the coming of Him who was God, anointed with spiritual grace above
His fellows, the holy of holies, the true King who should govern us, the true Priest who
<note type="footnote">516 Dan. ii. 34, 35.</note>

<pb n="353"/>
should offer Himself for us. In a word, the predictions of heathen ingenuity regarding
Christ’s coming are as different from sacred prophecy as the confession of devils from the
proclamation of angels.</p>
<p>16. By such arguments, which might be expanded if we were discussing with one brought
up in heathenism, and might be supported by proofs in still greater number, the inquirer
whom Faustus has brought before us would certainly be led to believe, unless he preferred
his sins to his salvation. As a believer, he would be taken to be cherished in the bosom of
the Catholic Church, and would be taught in due course the conduct required of him. He
would see many who do not practise the required duties; but this would not shake his faith,
even though these people should belong to the same Church and partake of the same sacraments
as himself. He would understand that few share in the inheritance of God, while
many partake in its outward signs; that few are united in holiness of life, and in the gift of
love shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us, which is a hidden spring
that no stranger can approach; and that many join in the solemnity of the sacrament, which
he that eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks judgment to himself, while he who neglects
to eat it shall not have life in him,517 and so shall never reach eternal life. He will understand,
too, that the good are called few as compared with the multitude of the evil, but that as
scattered over the world there are very many growing among the tares, and mixed with the
chaff, till the day of harvest and of purging. As this is taught in the Gospel, so is it foretold
by the prophets. We read, "As a lily among thorns, so is my beloved among the daughters;"518
and again, "I have dwelt in the tabernacles of Kedar; peaceful among them that hated
peace;"519 and again, "Mark in the forehead those who sigh and cry for the iniquities of my
people, which are done in the midst of them."520 The inquirer would be confirmed by such
passages; and being now a fellow-citizen with the saints and of the household of God, no
longer an alien from Israel, but an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile, would learn to utter
from a guileless heart the words which follow in the passage of Jeremiah already quoted, "O
Lord, the patience of Israel: let all that forsake Thee be dismayed." After speaking of the
partridge that is clamorous, and gathers what it has not brought forth; and after extolling
the city set on an hill which cannot be hid, to prevent heretics from drawing men away from
the Catholic Church; after the words, "A glorious high throne is our sanctuary," he seems
to ask himself, What do we make of all those evil men who are found mixed with the Church,
and who become more numerous as the Church extends, and as all nations are united in
Christ? And then follow the words, "O Lord, the patience of Israel." Patience is necessary

<note type="footnote">520 Ezek. ix. 1.</note>

<pb n="354"/>
to obey the command, "Suffer both to grow together till the harvest."521 Impatience towards
the evil might lead to forsaking the good, who in the strict sense are the body of Christ, and
to forsake them would be to forsake Him. So the prophet goes on to say, "Let all that forsake
Thee be dismayed; let those who have departed to the earth be confounded." The earth is
man trusting in himself, and inducing others to trust in him. So the prophet adds: "Let
them be overthrown, for they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of life." This is the cry
of the partridge, that it has got the fountain of life, and will give it; and so men are gathered
to it, and depart from Christ, as if Christ, whose name they had professed, had not fulfilled
His promise. The partridge gathers those whom it has not brought forth. And in order to
do this, it declares, The salvation which Christ promises is with me; I will give it. In opposition
to this the prophet says: "Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall
be saved." So we read in the apostle, "Let no man glory in men;"522 or in the words of the
prophet, "Thou art my praise."523 Such is a specimen of instruction in apostolic and
prophetic doctrine, by which a man may be built on the foundation of the apostles and
prophets.</p>
<p>17. Faustus has not told us how he would prove the divinity of Christ to the heathen,
whom he makes to say: I believe neither the prophets in support of Christ, nor Christ in
support of the prophets. It would be absurd to suppose that such a man would believe what
Christ says of Himself, when he disbelieves what He says of others. For if he thinks Him
unworthy of credit in one case, he must think Him so in all, or at least more so when
speaking of Himself than when speaking of others. Perhaps, failing this, Faustus would read
to him the Sibyls and Orpheus, and any heathen prophecies about Christ that he could find.
But how could he do this, when he confesses that he knows none? His words are: "If, as is
said, any prophecies of Christ are to be found in the Sibyl, or in Hermes, called Trismegistus,
or Orpheus, or any heathen poet." How could he read writings of which he knows nothing,
and which he supposes to exist only from report, to one who will not believe either the
prophets or Christ? What, then, would he do? Would he bring forward Manichæus as a
witness to Christ? The opposite of this is what the Manichæans do. They take advantage
of the widespread fragrance of the name of Christ to gain acceptance for Manichæus, that
the edge of their poisoned cup may be sweetened with this honey. Taking hold of the
promises of Christ to His disciples that He would send the Paraclete, that is, the Comforter
or Advocate, they say that this Paraclete is Manichæus, or in Manichæus, and so steal an
entrance into the minds of men who do not know when He who was promised by Christ
really came. Those who have read the canonical book called the Acts of the Apostles find
<note type="footnote">521 Matt. xiii. 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">522 1 Cor. iii. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">523 Jer. xvii. 14.</note>

<pb n="355"/>
a reference to Christ’s promise, and an account of its fulfillment. Faustus, then, has no proof
to give to the inquirer. It is not likely that any one will be so infatuated as to take the authority
of Manichæus when he rejects that of Christ. Would he not reply in derision, if not in anger,
Why do you ask me to believe Persian books, when you forbid me to believe Hebrew books?
The Manichæan has no hold on the inquirer, unless he is already in some way convinced
of the truth of Christianity. When he finds him willing to believe Christ, then he deludes
him with the representation of Christ given by Manichæus. So the partridge gathers what
it has not brought forth. When will you whom he gathers leave him? When will you see
him to be a fool, who tells you that Hebrew testimony is worthless in the case of unbelievers,
and superfluous to believers?</p>
<p>18. If believers are to throw away all the books which have led them to believe, I see no
reason why they should continue reading the Gospel itself. The Gospel, too, must be
worthless to this inquirer, who, according to Faustus’ pitiful supposition, rejects with ridicule
the authority of Christ. And to the believer it must be superfluous, if true notices of Christ
are superfluous to believers. And if the Gospel should be read by the believer, that he may
not forget what he has believed, so should the prophets, that he may not forget why he believed.
For if he forgets this his faith cannot be firm. By this principle, you should throw
away the books of Manichæus, on the authority of which you already believe that light—that
is, God—fought with darkness, and that, in order to bind darkness, the light was first swallowed
up and bound, and polluted and mangled by darkness, to be restored, and liberated,
and purified, and healed by your eating, for which you are rewarded by not being condemned
to the mass of darkness for ever, along with that part of the light which cannot be extricated.
This fiction is sufficiently published by your practice and your words. Why do you seek for
the testimony of books, and add to the embarrassment of your God by the consumption of
strength in the needless task of writing manuscripts? Burn all your parchments, with their
finely-ornamented binding; so you will be rid of a useless burden, and your God who suffers
confinement in the volume will be set free. What a mercy it would be to the members of
your God, if you could boil your books and eat them! There might be a difficulty, however,
from the prohibition of animal food. Then the writing must share in the impurity of the
sheepskin. Indeed, you are to blame for this, for, like what you say was done in the first war
between light and darkness, you brought what was clean in the pen in contact with the uncleanness
of the parchment. Or perhaps, for the sake of the colors, we may put it the other
way; and so the darkness would be yours, in the ink which you brought against the light of
the white pages. If these remarks irritate you, you should rather be angry with yourselves
for believing doctrines of which these are the necessary consequences. As for the books of
the apostles and prophets, we read them as a record of our faith, to encourage our hope and
animate our love. These books are in perfect harmony with one another; and their harmony,
like the music of a heavenly trumpet, wakens us from the torpor of worldliness, and urges

<pb n="356"/>
us on to the prize of our high calling. The apostle, after quoting from the prophets the
words, "The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on me," goes on to speak of the
benefit of reading the prophets: "For whatsoever things were written beforetime were
written for our learning; that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might
have hope." 524 If Faustus denies this, we can only say with Paul, "If any one shall preach
to you another doctrine than that ye have received, let him be accursed."525</p>

<p>Faustus abhors Moses for the awful curse he has pronounced upon Christ. Augustin expounds
the Christian doctrine of the suffering Saviour by comparing Old and New Testament
passages.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: If you ask why we do not believe Moses, it is on account of our love
and reverence for Christ. The most reckless man cannot regard with pleasure a person who
has cursed his father. So we abhor Moses, not so much for his blasphemy of everything
human and divine, as for the awful curse he has pronounced upon Christ the Son of God,
who for our salvation hung on the tree. Whether Moses did this intentionally or not is your
concern. Either way, he cannot be excused, or considered worthy of belief. His words are,
"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree."526 You tell me to believe this man, though, if
he was inspired, he must have cursed Christ knowingly and intentionally; and if he did it
in ignorance, he cannot have been divine. Take either alternative. Moses was no prophet,
and while cursing in his usual manner, he fell ignorantly into the sin of blasphemy against
God. Or he was indeed divine, and foresaw the future; and from ill-will to our salvation,
he directs the venom of his malediction against Him who was to accomplish that salvation
on a tree. He who thus injures the Son cannot surely have seen or known the Father. He
who knew nothing of the final ascension of the Son, cannot surely have foretold His advent.
Moreover, the extent of the injury inflicted by this curse is to be considered. For it denounces
all the righteous men and martyrs, and sufferers of every kind, who have died in this way,
as Peter and Andrew, and the rest. Such a cruel denunciation could never have come from
Moses if he had been a prophet, unless he was a bitter enemy of these sufferers. For he
pronounces them cursed not only of men but of God. What hope, then, of blessing remains
to Christ, or his apostles, or to us if we happen to be crucified for Christ’s sake? It indicates
great thoughtlessness in Moses, and the want of all divine inspiration, that he overlooked
the fact that men are hung on a tree for very different reasons, some for their crimes, and
others who suffer in the cause of God and of righteousness. In this thoughtless way lie heaps
all together without distinction under the same curse; whereas if he had had any sense, not
to say inspiration, if he wished to single out the punishment of the cross from all others as
specially detestable, he would have said, Cursed is every guilty and impious person that
hangeth on a tree. This would have made a distinction between the guilty and the innocent.
And yet even this would have been incorrect, for Christ took the malefactor from the cross
along with himself into the Paradise of his Father. What becomes of the curse on every one
that hangeth on a tree? Was Barabbas, the notorious robber, who certainly was not hung
on a tree, but was set free from prison at the request of the Jews, more blessed than the thief
<note type="footnote">526 Deut. xxi. 23.</note>

<pb n="358"/>
who accompanied Christ from the cross to heaven? Again, there is a curse on the man that
worships the sun or the moon. Now if under a heathen monarch I am forced to worship
the sun, and if from fear of this curse I refuse, shall I incur this other curse by suffering the
punishment of crucifixion? Perhaps Moses was in the habit of cursing everything good.
We think no more of his denunciation than of an old wife’s scolding. So we find him pronouncing
a curse on all youths of both sexes, when he says: "Cursed is every one that raiseth
not up a seed in Israel."527 This is aimed directly at Jesus, who, according to you, was born
among the Jews, and raised up no seed to continue his family. It points too at his disciples,
some of whom he took from the wives they had married, and some who were unmarried
he forbade to take wives. We have good reason, you see, for expressing our abhorrence of
the daring style in which Moses hurls his maledictions against Christ, against light, against
chastity, against everything divine. You cannot make much of the distinction between
hanging on a tree and being crucified, as you often try to do by way of apology; for Paul repudiates
such a distinction when he says, "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the
law, being made a curse for us; as it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree."528
2. Augustin replied: The pious Faustus is pained because Christ is cursed by Moses.
His love for Christ makes him hate Moses. Before explaining the sacred import and the
piety of the words, "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree," I would ask these pious
people why they are angry with Moses, since his curse does not affect their Christ. If Christ
hung on the tree, He must have been fastened to it with nails, the marks of which He showed
to His doubting disciple after His resurrection. Accordingly He must have had a vulnerable
and mortal body, which the Manichæans deny. Call the wounds and the marks false, and
it follows that His hanging on the tree was false. This Christ is not affected by the curse,
and there is no occasion for this indignation against the person uttering the curse. If they
pretend to be angry with Moses for cursing what they call the false death of Christ, what are
we to think of themselves, who do not curse Christ, but, what is much worse, make Him a
liar? If it is wrong to curse mortality, it is a much more heinous offense to sully the purity
of truth. But let us make these heretical cavils an occasion for explaining this mystery to
believers.</p>
<p>3. Death comes upon man as the punishment of sin, and so is itself called sin; not that
a man sins in dying, but because sin is the cause of his death. So the word tongue, which
properly means the fleshy substance between the teeth and the palate, is applied in a secondary
sense to the result of the tongue’s action. In this sense we speak of a Latin tongue and
a Greek tongue. The word hand, too, means both the members of the body we use in
working, and the writing which is done with the hand. In this sense we speak of writing as
<note type="footnote">527 Deut. xxv. 5-10.</note>
<note type="footnote">528 Gal. iii. 10.</note>

<pb n="359"/>
being proved to be the hand of a certain person, or of recognizing the hand of a friend. The
writing is certainly not a member of the body, but the name hand is given to it because it is
the hand that does it. So sin means both a bad action deserving punishment, and death the
consequence of sin. Christ has no sin in the sense of deserving death, but He bore for our
sakes sin in the sense of death as brought on human nature by sin. This is what hung on
the tree; this is what was cursed by Moses. Thus was death condemned that its reign might
cease, and cursed that it might be destroyed. By Christ’s taking our sin in this sense, its
condemnation is our deliverance, while to remain in subjection to sin is to be condemned.</p>
<p>4. What does Faustus find strange in the curse pronounced on sin, on death, and on
human mortality, which Christ had on account of man’s sin, though He Himself was sinless?
Christ’s body was derived from Adam, for His mother the Virgin Mary was a child of Adam.
But God said in Paradise, "On the day that ye eat, ye shall surely die." This is the curse which
hung on the tree. A man may deny that Christ was cursed who denies that He died. But
the man who believes that Christ died, and acknowledges that death is the fruit of sin, and
is itself called sin, will understand who it is that is cursed by Moses, when he hears the apostle
saying "For our old man is crucified with Him."529 The apostle boldly says of Christ, "He
was made a curse for us;" for he could also venture to say, "He died for all." "He died," and
"He was cursed," are the same. Death is the effect of the curse; and all sin is cursed, whether
it means the action which merits punishment, or the punishment which follows. Christ,
though guiltless, took our punishment, that He might cancel our guilt, and do away with
our punishment.</p>
<p>5. These things are not my conjectures, but are affirmed constantly by the apostle, with
an emphasis sufficient to rouse the careless and to silence the gainsayers. "God," he says,
"sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh."530
Christ’s flesh was not sinful, because it was not born of Mary by ordinary generation; but
because death is the effect of sin, this flesh, in being mortal, had the likeness of sinful flesh.
This is called sin in the following words, "that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh."
Again he says: "He hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made
the righteousness of God in Him."531 Why should not Moses call accursed what Paul calls
sin? In this prediction the prophet claims a share with the apostle in the reproach of the
heretics. For whoever finds fault with the word cursed in the prophet, must find fault with
the word sin in the apostle; for curse and sin go together.</p>
<p>6. If we read, "Cursed of God is every one that hangeth on a tree," the addition of the
words "of God" creates no difficulty. For had not God hated sin and our death, He would
<note type="footnote">529 Rom. vi. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">530 Rom. viii. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">531 2 Cor. v. 21.</note>

<pb n="360"/>
not have sent His Son to bear and to abolish it. And there is nothing strange in God’s
cursing what He hates. For His readiness to give us the immortality which will be had at
the coming of Christ, is in proportion to the compassion with which He hated our death
when it hung on the cross at the death of Christ. And if Moses curses every one that hangeth
on a tree, it is certainly not because he did not foresee that righteous men would be crucified,
but rather because He foresaw that heretics would deny the death of the Lord to be real, and
would try to disprove the application of this curse to Christ, in order that they might disprove
the reality of His death. For if Christ’s death was not real, nothing cursed hung on the cross
when He was crucified, for the crucifixion cannot have been real. Moses cries from the
distant past to these heretics: Your evasion in denying the reality of the death of Christ is
useless. Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree; not this one or that, but absolutely every
one. What! the Son of God? Yes, assuredly. This is the very thing you object to, and that
you are so anxious to evade. You will not allow that He was cursed for us, because you will
not allow that He died for us. Exemption from Adam’s curse implies exemption from his
death. But as Christ endured death as man, and for man; so also, Son of God as He was,
ever living in His own righteousness, but dying for our offences, He submitted as man, and
for man, to bear the curse which accompanies death. And as He died in the flesh which He
took in bearing our punishment, so also, while ever blessed in His own righteousness, He
was cursed for our offences, in the death which He suffered in bearing our punishment.
And these words "every one" are intended to check the ignorant officiousness which would
deny the reference of the curse to Christ, and so, because the curse goes along with death,
would lead to the denial of the true death of Christ.</p>
<p>7. The believer in the true doctrine of the gospel will understand that Christ is not reproached
by Moses when he speaks of Him as cursed, not in His divine majesty, but as
hanging on the tree as our substitute, bearing our punishment, any more than He is praised
by the Manichæans when they deny that He had a mortal body, so as to suffer real death.
In the curse of the prophet there is praise of Christ’s humility, while in the pretended regard
of the heretics there is a charge of falsehood. If, then, you deny that Christ was cursed, you
must deny that He died; and then you have to meet, not Moses, but the apostles. Confess
that He died, and you may also confess that He, without taking our sin, took its punishment.
Now the punishment of sin cannot be blessed, or else it would be a thing to be desired. The
curse is pronounced by divine justice, and it will be well for us if we are redeemed from it.
Confess then that Christ died, and you may confess that He bore the curse for us; and that
when Moses said, "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree," he said in fact, To hang on
a tree is to be mortal, or actually to die. He might have said, "Cursed is every one that is
mortal," or "Cursed is every one dying;" but the prophet knew that Christ would suffer on
the cross, and that heretics would say that He hung on the tree only in appearance, without
really dying. So he exclaims, Cursed; meaning that He really died. He knew that the death

<pb n="361"/>
of sinful man, which Christ though sinless bore, came from that curse, "If ye touch it, ye
shall surely die." Thus also, the serpent hung on the pole was intended to show that Christ
did not feign death, but that the real death into which the serpent by his fatal counsel cast
mankind was hung on the cross of Christ’s passion. The Manichæans turn away from the
view of this real death, and so they are not healed of the poison of the serpent, as we read
that in the wilderness as many as looked were healed.</p>
<p>8. It is true, some ignorantly distinguish between hanging on a tree and being crucified.
So some explain this passage as referring to Judas. But how do they know whether he hung
himself from wood or from stone? Faustus is right in saying that the apostle obliges us to
refer the words to Christ. Such ignorant Catholics are the prey of the Manichæans. Such
they get hold of and entangle in their sophistry. Such were we when we fell into this heresy,
and adhered to it. Such were we, when, not by our own strength, but by the mercy of God,
we were rescued.</p>
<p>9. What attacks on divine things does Faustus speak of when he charges Moses with
sparing nothing human or divine? He makes the charge without stopping to prove it. We
know, on the contrary, that Moses gave due praise to everything really divine, and in human
affairs was a just ruler, considering his times and the grace of his dispensation. It will be
time to prove this when we see any proof of Faustus’ charges. It may be clever to make such
charges cautiously, but there is great incaution in the cleverness which ruins its possessor.
It is good to be clever on the side of truth, but it is a poor thing to be clever in opposition
to the truth. Faustus says that Moses spared nothing human or divine; not that he spared
no god or man. If he said that Moses did not spare God, it could easily be shown in reply
that Moses everywhere does honor to the true God, whom he declares to be the Maker of
heaven and earth. Again, if he said that Moses spared none of the gods, he would betray
himself to Christians as a worshipper of the false gods that Moses denounces; and so he
would be prevented from gathering what he has not brought forth, by the brood taking
refuge under the wings of the Mother Church. Faustus tries to ensnare the babes, by saying
that Moses spared nothing divine, wishing not to frighten Christians with a profession of
belief in the gods, which would be plainly opposed to Christianity, and at the same time
appearing to take the side of the Pagans against us; for they know that Moses has said many
plain and pointed things against the idols and gods of the heathen, which are devils.</p>
<p>10. If the Manichæans disapprove of Moses on this account, let them confess that they
are worshippers of idols and devils. This, indeed, may be the case without their being aware
of it. The apostle tells us that "in the last days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed
to seducing spirits, and to doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy."532 Whence but
from devils, who are fond of falsehood, could the idea have come that Christ’s sufferings
<note type="footnote">532 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2.</note>

<pb n="362"/>
and death were unreal, and that the marks which He showed of His wounds were unreal?
Are these not the doctrines of lying devils, which teach that Christ, the Truth itself, was a
deceiver? Besides, the Manichæans openly teach the worship, if not of devils, still of created
things, which the apostle condemns in the words, "They worshipped and served the creature
rather than the Creator."533</p>
<p>11. As there is an unconscious worship of idols and devils in the fanciful legends of the
Manichæans, so they knowingly serve the creature in their worship of the sun and moon.
And in what they call their service of the Creator they really serve their own fancy, and not
the Creator at all. For they deny that God created those things which the apostle plainly
declares to be the creatures of God, when he says of food, "Every creature of God is good,
and nothing to be refused, if it is received with thanksgiving."534 This is sound doctrine,
which you cannot bear, and so turn to fables. The apostle praises the creature of God, but
forbids the worship of it; and in the same way Moses gives due praise to the sun and moon,
while at the same time he states the fact of their having been made by God, and placed by
Him in their courses,—the sun to rule the day, and the moon to rule the night. Probably
you think Moses spared nothing divine, simply because he forbade the worship of the sun
and moon, whereas you turn towards them in all directions in your worship. But the sun
and moon take no pleasure in your false praises. It is the devil, the transgressor, that delights
in false praises. The powers of heaven, who have not fallen by sin, wish their Creator to be
praised in them; and their true praise is that which does no wrong to their Creator. He is
wronged when they are said to be His members, or parts of His substance. For He is perfect
and independent, underived, not divided or scattered in space, but unchangeably self-existent,
self-sufficient, and blessed in Himself. In the abundance of His goodness, He by His word
spoke, and they were made: He commanded, and they were created. And if earthly bodies
are good, of which the apostle spoke when he said that no food is unclean, because every
creature of God is good, much more the heavenly bodies, of which the sun and moon are
the chief; for the apostle says again, "The glory of the terrestrial is one, and the glory of the
celestial is another."535</p>
<p>12. Moses, then, casts no reproach on the sun and moon when he prohibits their worship.
He praises them as heavenly bodies; while he also praises God as the Creator of both
heavenly and earthly, and will not allow of His being insulted by giving the worship due to
<note type="footnote">533 Rom. i. 25.</note>
<note type="footnote">534 1 Tim. iv. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">535 1 Cor. xv. 40.</note>

<pb n="363"/>
Him to those who are praised only as dependent upon Him. Faustus prides himself on the
ingenuity of his objection to the curse pronounced by Moses on the worship of the sun and
moon. He says, "If under a heathen monarch I am forced to worship the sun, and if from
fear of this curse I refuse, shall I incur this other curse by suffering the punishment of crucifixion?"
No heathen monarch is forcing you to worship the sun: nor would the sun itself
force you, if it were reigning on the earth, as neither does it now wish to be worshipped.
As the Creator bears with blasphemers till the judgment, so these celestial bodies bear with
their deluded worshippers till the judgment of the Creator. It should be observed that no
Christian monarch could enforce the worship of the sun. Faustus instances a heathen
monarch, for he knows that their worship of the sun is a heathen custom. Yet, in spite of
this opposition to Christianity, the partridge takes the name of Christ, that it may gather
what it has not brought forth. The answer to this objection is easy, and the force of truth
will soon break the horns of this dilemma. Suppose, then, a Christian threatened by royal
authority with being hung on a tree if he will not worship the sun. If I avoid, you say, the
curse pronounced by the law on the worshipper of the sun, I incur the curse pronounced
by the same law on him that hangs on a tree. So you will be in a difficulty; only that you
worship the sun without being forced by anybody. But a true Christian, built on the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, distinguishes the curses, and the reasons of them.
He sees that one refers to the mortal body which is hung on the tree, and the other to the
mind which worships the sun. For though the body bows in worship,—which also is a
heinous offence,—the belief or imagination of the object worshipped is an act of the mind.
The death implied in both curses is in one case the death of the body, and in the other the
death of the soul. It is better to have the curse in bodily death,—which will be removed in
the resurrection,—than the curse in the death of the soul, condemning it along with the
body to eternal fire. The Lord solves this difficulty in the words: "Fear not them that kill
the body, but cannot kill the soul; but fear him who has power to cast both soul and body
into hell-fire."536 In other words, fear not the curse of bodily death, which in time is removed;
but fear the curse of spiritual death, which leads to the eternal torment of both soul and
body. Be assured, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree is no old wife’s railing, but a
prophetical utterance. Christ, by the curse, takes the curse away, as He takes away death by
death, and sin by sin. In the words, "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree," there is
no more blasphemy than in the words of the apostle, "He died," or, "Our old man was crucified
along with Him,"537 or, "By sin He condemned sin,"538 or, "He made Him to be sin for
us who knew no sin,"539 and in many similar passages. Confess, then, that when you exclaim

against the curse of Christ, you exclaim against His death. If this is not an old wife’s railing
on your part, it is devilish delusion, which makes you deny the death of Christ because your
own souls are dead. You teach people that Christ’s death was feigned, making Christ your
leader in the falsehood with which you use the name of Christian to mislead men.</p>
<p>13. If Faustus thinks Moses an enemy of continence or virginity because he says, "Cursed
is everyone that raiseth not up seed in Israel," let them hear the words of Isaiah: "Thus saith
the Lord to all eunuchs; To them who keep my precepts, and choose the things that please
me, and regard my covenant, will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name
better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be
cut off."540 Though our adversaries disagree with Moses, if they agree with Isaiah it is
something gained. It is enough for us to know that the same God spoke by both Moses and
Isaiah, and that every one is cursed who raiseth not up seed in Israel, both then when begetting
children in marriage (for the continuation of the people was a civil duty), and now because
no one spiritually born should rest content without seeking spiritual increase in the
production of Christians by preaching Christ, each one according to his ability. So that the
times of both Testaments are briefly described in the words, "Cursed is every one that raiseth
not up seed in Israel."541</p>

<p>Faustus rejects the Old Testament because it leaves no room for Christ. Christ the one Bridegroom
suffices for His Bride the Church. Augustin answers as well as he can, and reproves
the Manichæans with presumption in claiming to be the Bride of Christ.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Why do we not receive the Old Testament? Because when a vessel is
full, what is poured on it is not received, but allowed to run over; and a full stomach rejects
what it cannot hold. So the Jews, satisfied with the Old Testament, reject the New; and we
who have received the New Testament from Christ, reject the Old. You receive both because
you are only half filled with each, and the one is not completed, but corrupted by the other.
For vessels half filled should not be filled up with anything of a different nature from what
they already contain. If it contains wine, it should be filled up with wine, honey with honey,
vinegar with vinegar. For to pour gall on honey, or water on wine, or alkalies on vinegar,
is not addition, but adulteration. This is why we do not receive the Old Testament. Our
Church, the bride of Christ, the poor bride of a rich bridegroom, is content with the possession
of her husband, and scorns the wealth of inferior lovers, and despises the gifts of the
Old Testament and of its author, and from regard to her own character, receives only the
letters of her husband. We leave the Old Testament to your Church, that, like a bride
faithless to her spouse, delights in the letters and gifts of another. This lover who corrupts
your chastity, the God of the Hebrews in his stone tablets promises you gold and silver, and
abundance of food, and the land of Canaan. Such low rewards have tempted you to be unfaithful
to Christ, after all the rich dowry bestowed by him. By such attractions the God of
the Hebrews gains over the bride of Christ. You must know that you are cheated, and that
these promises are false. This God is in poverty and beggary, and cannot do what he
promises. For if he cannot give these things to the synagogue, his proper wife, who obeys
him in all things like a servant, how can he bestow them on you who are strangers, and who
proudly throw off his yoke from your necks? Go on, then, as you have begun, join the new
cloth to the old garment, put the new wine in old bottles, serve two masters without pleasing
either, make Christianity a monster, half horse and half man; but allow us to serve only
Christ, content with his immortal dower, and imitating the apostle who says, "Our sufficiency
is of God, who has made us able ministers of the New Testament."542 In the God of the
Hebrews we have no interest whatever; for neither can he perform his promises, nor do we
desire that he should. The liberality of Christ has made us indifferent to the flatteries of this
stranger. This figure of the relation of the wife to her husband is sanctioned by Paul, who
says: "The woman that has a husband is bound to her husband as long as he liveth; but if
her husband die, she is freed from the law of her husband. So, then, if while her husband
<note type="footnote">542 2 Cor. iii. 5, 6.</note>

<pb n="366"/>
liveth she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband be
dead, she is not an adulteress, though she be married to another man."543 Here he shows
that there is a spiritual adultery in being united to Christ before repudiating the author of
the law, and counting him, as it were, as dead. This applies chiefly to the Jews who believe
in Christ, and who ought to forget their former superstition. We who have been converted
to Christ from heathenism, look upon the God of the Hebrews not merely as dead, but as
never having existed, and do not need to be told to forget him. A Jew, when he believes,
should regard Adonai as dead; a Gentile should regard his idol as dead; and so with everything
that has been held sacred before conversion. One who, after giving up idolatry, worships
both the God of the Hebrews and Christ, is like an abandoned woman, who after the death
of one husband marries two others.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: Let all who have given their hearts to Christ say whether they can
listen patiently to these things, unless Christ Himself enable them. Faustus, full of the new
honey, rejects the old vinegar; and Paul, full of the old vinegar, has poured out half that the
new honey may be poured in, not to be kept, but to be corrupted. When the apostle calls
himself a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
this is the new honey. But when he adds, "which He promised before by His prophets in
the Holy Scriptures of His Son, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,"544
this is the old vinegar. Who could bear to hear this, unless the apostle himself consoled us
by saying: "There must be heresies, that they which are approved may be made manifest
among you?"545 Why should we repeat what we said already?546—that the new cloth and
the old garment, the new wine and the old bottles, mean not two Testaments, but two lives
and two hopes,—that the relation of the two Testaments is figuratively described by the
Lord when He says: "Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of God is like an
householder bringing out of his treasure things new and old."547 The reader may remember
this as said before, or he may find it on looking back. For if any one tries to serve God with
two hopes, one of earthly felicity, and the other of the kingdom of heaven, the two hopes
cannot agree; and when the latter is shaken by some affliction, the former will be lost too.
Thus it is said, No man can serve two masters; which Christ explains thus: "Ye cannot serve
God and Mammon."548 But to those who rightly understand it, the Old Testament is a
prophecy of the New. Even in that ancient people, the holy patriarchs and prophets, who

understood the part they performed, or which they were instrumental in performing, had
this hope of eternal life in the New Testament. They belonged to the New Testament, because
they understood and loved it, though revealed only in figure. Those belonging to the Old
Testament were the people who cared for nothing else but the temporal promises, without
understanding them as significant of eternal things. But all this has already been more than
enough insisted on.</p>
<p>3. It is amazingly bold in the impious and impure sect of the Manichæans to boast of
being the chaste bride of Christ. All the effect of such a boast on the really chaste members
of the holy Church is to remind them of the apostle’s warning against deceivers: "I have
joined you to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear lest, as the
serpent deceived Eve by his guile, so your minds also should be corrupted from the purity
which is in Christ."549 What else do those preachers of another gospel than that which we
have received try to do, but to corrupt us from the purity which we preserve for Christ,
when they stigmatize the law of God as old, and praise their own falsehoods as new, as if all
that is new must be good, and all that is old bad? The Apostle John, however, praises the
old commandment, and the Apostle Paul bids us avoid novelties in doctrine. As an unworthy
son and servant of the Catholic Church, the true bride of the true Christ, I too, as appointed
to give out food to my fellow-servants, would speak to her a word of counsel. Continue
ever to shun the profane errors of the Manichæans, which have been tried by the experience
of thine own children, and condemned by their recovery. By that heresy I was once separated
from thy fellowship, and after running into danger which ought to have been avoided, I escaped.
Restored to thy service, my experience may perhaps be profitable to thee. Unless
thy true and truthful Bridegroom, from whose side thou wert made, had obtained the remission
of sins through His own real blood, the gulf of error would have swallowed me up; I
should have become dust, and been devoured by the serpent. Be not misled by the name
of truth. The truth is in thine own milk, and in thine own bread. They have the name only,
and not the thing. Thy full-grown children, indeed, are secure; but I speak to thy babes, my
brothers, and sons, and masters, whom thou, the virgin mother, fertile as pure, dost cherish
into life under thine anxious wings, or dost nourish with the milk of infancy. I call upon
these, thy tender offspring, not to be seduced by noisy vanities, but rather to pronounce
accursed any one that preaches to them another gospel than that which they have received
in thee. I call upon these not to leave the true and truthful Christ, in whom are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge; not to forsake the abundance of His goodness which
He has laid up for them that fear Him, and has wrought for them that trust in Him.550 How
can they expect to find truthful words in one who preaches an untruthful Christ? Scorn the
<note type="footnote">549 2 Cor. xi. 2, 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">550 Ps. xxxi. 19.</note>

<pb n="368"/>
reproaches cast on thee, for thou knowest well that the gift which thou desirest from thy
Bridegroom is eternal life, for He Himself is eternal life.</p>
<p>4. It is a silly falsehood that thou hast been seduced to another God, who promises
abundance of food and the land of Canaan. For thou canst perceive how the saints of old,
who were also thy children, were enlightened by these figures which were prophecies of
thee. Thou needest not regard the poor jest against the stone tablets, for the stony heart of
which they were in old times a figure is not in thee. For thou art an epistle of the apostles,
"written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on
the fleshy tables of the heart."551 Our opponents ignorantly think that these words are in
their favor, and that the apostle finds fault with the dispensation of the Old Testament,
whereas they are the words of the prophet. This utterance of the apostles was a fulfillment
of the long anterior utterances of the prophet whom the Manichæans reject, for they believe
the apostles without understanding them. The prophet says: "I will take away from them
the stony heart, and I will give them a heart of flesh."552 What is this but "Not on tables of
stones but on the fleshy tables of the heart"? For by the heart of flesh and the fleshy tables
is not meant a carnal understanding: but as flesh feels, whereas a stone cannot, the insensibility
of stone signifies an unintelligent heart, and the sensibility of flesh signifies an intelligent
heart. Instead, then, of scoffing at thee, they deserve to be ridiculed who say that earth,
and wood, and stones have sense, and that their life is more intelligent than animal life. So,
not to speak of the truth, even their own fiction obliges them to confess that the law written
on tables of stone was purer than their sacred parchments. Or perhaps they prefer sheepskin
to stone, because their legends make stones the bones of princes. In any case, the ark of the
Old Testament was a cleaner covering for the tables of stone than the goatskin of their manuscripts.
Laugh at these things, while pitying them, to show their falsehood and absurdity.
With a heart no longer stony, thou canst see in these stone tablets a suitableness to that
hard-hearted people; and at the same time thou canst find even there the stone, thy Bridegroom,
described by Peter as "a living stone, rejected by men, but chosen of God, and precious."
To them He was "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence;" but to thee, "the stone
which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner."553 This is all explained by
Peter, and is quoted from the prophets, with whom these heretics have nothing to do. Fear
not, then, to read these tablets—they are from thy Husband; to others the stone was a sign
of insensibility, but to thee of strength and stability. With the finger of God these tablets
were written; with the finger of God thy Lord cast out devils; with the finger of God drive
thou away the doctrines of lying devils which sear the conscience. With these tablets thou

<note type="footnote">552 Ezek. xi. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">553 1 Pet. ii. 4-8.</note>

<pb n="369"/>
canst confound the seducer who calls himself the Paraclete, that he may impose upon thee
by a sacred name. For on the fiftieth day after the passover the tables were given; and on
the fiftieth day after the passion of thy Bride-groom—of whom the passover was a type—the
finger of God, the Holy Spirit, the promised Paraclete, was given. Fear not the tablets which
convey to thee ancient writings now made plain. Only be not under the law, lest fear prevent
thy fulfilling it; but be under grace, that love, which is the fulfilling of the law, may be in
thee. For it was in a review of these very tablets that the friend of thy Bridegroom said: "For
thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not covet, and if there
be any other commandment, it is contained in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."554
One table contains the precept of love to God, and the other of love to man. And He who
first sent these tablets Himself came to enjoin those precepts on which hang the law and the
prophets.555 In the first precept is the chastity of thy espousals; in the second is the unity
of thy members. In the one thou art united to divinity; in the other thou dost gather a society.
And these two precepts are identical with the ten, of which three relate to God, and seven
to our neighbor. Such is the chaste tablet in which thy Lover and thy Beloved of old prefigured
to thee the new song on a psaltery of ten strings; Himself to be extended on the cross
for thee, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh, and that the righteouness of the law
might be fulfilled in thee. Such is the conjugal tablet, which may well be hated by the unfaithful
wife.</p>
<p>5. I turn now to thee, thou deluded and deluding congregation of Manichæus,—wedded
to so many elements, or rather prostituted to so many devils, and impregnated with blasphemous
falsehoods,—dost thou dare to slander as unchaste the marriage of the Catholic
Church with thy Lord? Behold thy lovers, one balancing creation, and the other bearing it
up like Atlas. For one, by thy account, holds the sources of the elements, and hangs the
world in space; while the other keeps him up by kneeling down and carrying the weight on
his shoulders. Where are those beings? And if they are so occupied, how can they come to
visit thee, to spend an idle hour in getting their shoulders or their fingers relieved by thy
soft, soothing touch? But thou art deceived by evil spirits which commit adultery with thee,
that thou mayest conceive falsehoods and bring forth vanities. Well mayest thou reject the
message of the true God, as opposed to thy parchments, where in the vain imaginations of
a wanton mind thou hast gone after so many false gods. The fictions of the poets are more
<note type="footnote">554 Rom. xiii. 9, 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">555 Matt. xxii. 37-40.</note>

<pb n="370"/>
respectable than thine, in this at least, that they deceive no one; while the fables in thy books,
by assuming an appearance of truth, mislead the childish, both young and old, and pervert
their minds. As the apostle says, they have itching ears, and turn away from hearing the
truth to listen to fables.556 How shouldest thou bear the sound doctrine of these tables,
where the first commandment is, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord,"557 when
thy corrupt affections find shameful delight in so many false deities? Dost thou not remember
thy love-song, where thou describest the chief ruler in perennial majesty, crowned with
flowers, and of fiery countenance? To have even one such lover is shameful; for a chaste
wife seeks not a husband crowned with flowers. And thou canst not say that this description
or representation has a typical meaning, for thou art wont to praise Manichæus for nothing
more than for speaking to thee the simple naked truth without the disguise of figures. So
the God of thy song is a real king, bearing a sceptre and crowned with flowers. When he
wears a crown of flowers, he ought to put aside his sceptre; for effeminacy and majesty are
incongruous. And then he is not thy only lover; for the song goes on to tell of twelve seasons
clothed in flowers, and filled with song, throwing their flowers at their father’s face. These
are twelve great gods of thine, three in each of the four regions surrounding the first deity.
How this deity can be infinite, when he is thus circumscribed, no one can say. Besides, there
are countless principalities, and hosts of gods, and troops of angels, which thou sayest were
not created by God, but produced from His substance.</p>
<p>6. Thou art thus convicted of worshipping gods without number; for thou canst not
bear the sound doctrine which teaches that there is one Son of one God, and one Spirit of
both. And these, instead of being without number, are not three Gods; for not only is their
substance one and the same, but their operation by means of this substance is also one and
the same, while they have a separate manifestation in the material creation. These things
thou dost not understand, and canst not receive. Thou art full, as thou sayest, for thou art
steeped in blasphemous absurdities. Will thou continue burying thyself under such
crudities? Sing on, then, and open thine eyes, if thou canst, to thine own shame. In this
doctrine of lying devils thou art invited to fabulous dwellings of angels in a happy clime,
and to fragrant fields where nectar flows for ever from trees and hills, in seas and rivers.
These are the fictions of thy foolish heart, which revels in such idle fancies. Such expressions
are sometimes used as figurative descriptions of the abundance of spiritual enjoyments; and
they lead the mind of the student to inquire into their hidden meaning. Sometimes there
is a material representation to the bodily senses, as the fire in the bush, the rod becoming a
serpent, and the serpent a rod, the garment of the Lord not divided by His persecutors, the
anointing of His feet or of His head by a devout woman, the branches of the multitude
<note type="footnote">556 2 Tim. iv. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">557 Deut. vi. 4.</note>

<pb n="371"/>
preceding and following Him when riding on the ass. Sometimes, either in sleep or in a
trance, the spirit is informed by means of figures taken from material things, as Jacob’s
ladder, and the stone in Daniel cut out without hands and growing into a mountain, and
Peter’s vessel, and all that John saw. Sometimes the figures are only in the language; as in
the Song of Songs, and in the parable of a householder making a marriage for his son, or
that of the prodigal son, or that of the man who planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen.
Thou boastest of Manichæus as having come last, not to use figures, but to explain
them. His expositions throw light on ancient types, and leave no problem unsolved. This
idea is supported by the assertion that the ancient types, in vision or in action or in words,
had in view the coming of Manichæus, by whom they were all to be explained; while he,
knowing that no one is to follow him, makes use of a style free from all figurative expressions.
What, then, are those fields, and shady hills, and crowns of flowers, and fragrant odors, in
which the desires of thy fleshly mind take pleasure? If they are not significant figures, they
are either idle fancies or delirious dreams. If they are figures, away with the impostor who
seduces thee with the promise of naked truth, and then mocks thee with idle tales. His
ministers and his wretched deluded followers are wont to bait their hook with that saying
of the apostle, "Now we see through a glass in a figure, but then face to face."558 As if, forsooth,
the Apostle Paul knew in part, and prophesied in part, and saw through a glass in a
figure; whereas all this is removed at the coming of Manichæus, who brings that which is
perfect, and reveals the truth face to face. O fallen and shameless! still to continue uttering
such folly, still feeding on the wind, still embracing the idols of thine own heart. Hast thou,
then, seen face to face the king with the sceptre, and the crown of flowers, and the hosts of
gods, and the great worldholder with six faces and radiant with light, and that other exalted
ruler surrounded with troops of angels, and the invincible warrior with a spear in his right
hand and a shield in his left, and the famous sovereign who moves the three wheels of fire,
water, and wind, and Atlas, chief of all, bearing the world on his shoulders, and supporting
himself on his arms? These, and a thousand other marvels, hast thou seen face to face, or
are thy songs doctrines learned from lying devils, though thou knowest it not? Alas!
miserable prostitute to these dreams, such are the vanities which thou drinkest up instead
of the truth; and, drunk with this deadly poison, thou darest with this jest of the tablets to
affront the matronly purity of the spouse of the only Son of God; because no longer under
the tutorship of the law, but under the control of grace, neither proud in activity nor
crouching in fear, she lives by faith, and hope, and love, the Israel in whom there is no guile,
who hears what is written: "The Lord thy God is one God." This thou hearest not, and art
gone a whoring after a multitude of false gods.</p>
<note type="footnote">558 1 Cor. xiii. 9.</note>

<pb n="372"/>
<p>7. Of necessity these tables are against thee, for the second commandment is, "Thou
shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain;" whereas thou dost attribute the vanity
of falsehood to Christ Himself, who, to remove the vanity of the fleshly mind, rose in a true
body, visible to the bodily eye. So also the third commandment about the rest of the Sabbath
is against thee, for thou art tossed about by a multitude of restless fancies. How these three
commandments relate to the love of God, thou hast neither the power nor the will to understand.
Shamefully headstrong and turbulent, thou hast reached the height of folly, vanity,
and worthlessness; thy beauty is spoiled, and thine order perished. I know thee, for I was
once the same. How shall I now teach thee that these three precepts relate to the love of
God, of whom, and by whom, and in whom are all things? How canst thou understand this,
when thy pernicious doctrines prevent thee from understanding and from obeying the
seven precepts relating to the love of our neighbor, which is the bond of human society?
The first of these precepts is, "Honor thy father and mother;" which Paul quotes as the first
commandment with promise, and himself repeats the injunction. But thou art taught by
thy doctrine of devils to regard thy parents as thine enemies, because their union brought
thee into the bonds of flesh, and laid impure fetters even on thy god. The doctrine that the
production of children is an evil, directly opposes the next precept, "Thou shall not commit
adultery;" for those who believe this doctrine, in order that their wives may not conceive,
are led to commit adultery even in marriage. They take wives, as the law declares, for the
procreation of children; but from this erroneous fear of polluting the substance of the deity,
their intercourse with their wives is not of a lawful character; and the production of children,
which is the proper end of marriage, they seek to avoid. As the apostle long ago predicted
of thee, thou dost indeed forbid to marry, for thou seekest to destroy the purpose of marriage.
Thy doctrine turns marriage into an adulterous connection, and the bed-chamber into a
brothel. This false doctrine leads in a similar way to the transgression of the commandment,
"Thou shall not kill." For thou dost not give bread to the hungry, from fear of imprisoning
in flesh the member of thy God. From fear of fancied murder, thou dost actually commit
murder. For if thou wast to meet a beggar starving for want of food, by the law of God to
refuse him food would be murder; while to give food would be murder by the law of
Manichæus. Not one commandment in the decalogue dost thou observe. If thou wert to
abstain from theft, thou wouldst be guilty of allowing bread or food, whatever it might be,
to undergo the misery of being devoured by a man of no merit, instead of running off with
it to the laboratory of the stomach of thine elect; and so by theft saving thy god from the
imprisonment with which he is threatened, and also from that from which he already suffers.
Then, if thou art caught in the theft, wilt thou not swear by this god that thou art not guilty?
For what will he do to thee when thou sayest to him, I swore by thee falsely, but it was for
thy benefit; a regard for thine honor would have been fatal to thee? So the precept, Thou
shall not bear false witness, will be broken, not only in thy testimony, but in thine oath, for

<pb n="373"/>
the sake of the liberation of the members of thy god. The commandment, "Thou shall not
covet thy neighbor’s wife," is the only one which thy false doctrine does not oblige thee to
break. But if it is unlawful to covet our neighbor’s wife, what must it be to excite covetousness
in others? Remember thy beautiful gods and goddesses presenting themselves with the
purpose of exciting desire in the male and female leaders of darkness, in order that the
gratification of this passion might effect the liberation of this god, who is in confinement
everywhere, and who requires the assistance of such self-degradation. The last command-
ment, "Thou shall not covet the possessions of thy neighbor," it is wholly impossible for thee
to obey. Does not this god of thine delude thee with the promise of making new worlds in
a region belonging to another, to be the scene of thine imaginary triumph after thine imaginary
conquest? In the desire for the accomplishment of these wild fancies, while at the
same time thou believest that this land of darkness is in the closest neighborhood with thine
own substance, thou certainly covetest the possessions of thy neighbor. Well indeed mayest
thou dislike the tables which contain such good precepts in opposition to thy false doctrine.
The three relating to the love of God thou dost entirely set aside. The seven by which human
society is preserved thou keepest only from a regard to the opinion of men, or from fear of
human laws; or good customs make thee averse to some crimes; or thou art restrained by
the natural principle of not doing to another what thou wouldst not have done to thyself.
But whether thou doest what thou wouldst not have done to thyself, or refrainest from doing
what thou wouldst not have done to thyself, thou seest the opposition of the heresy to the
law, whether thou actest according to it or not.</p>
<p>8. The true bride of Christ, whom thou hast the audacity to taunt with the stone tablets,
knows the difference between the letter and the spirit, or in other words, between law and
grace; and serving God no longer in the oldness of the letter, but in newness of spirit, she
is not under the law, but under grace. She is not blinded by a spirit of controversy, but
learns meekly from the apostle what is this law which we are not to be under; for "it was
given," he says, "on account of transgression, till the seed should come to whom the promise
was made."559 And again: "It entered, that the offence might abound; but where sin
abounded, grace has much more abounded."560 Not that the law is sin, though it cannot
give life without grace, but rather increases the guilt; for "where there is no law, there is no
transgression."561 The letter without the spirit, the law without grace, can only condemn.
So the apostle explains his meaning, in case any should not understand: "What shall we say
then? Is the law sin? God forbid. For I had not known sin but by the law. For I had not
known lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the

<pb n="374"/>
commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment
holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me?
God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good."562
She at whom thou scoffest knows what this means; for she asks earnestly, and seeks humbly,
and knocks meekly. She sees that no fault is found with the law, when it is said, "The letter
killeth, but the spirit giveth life," any more than with knowledge, when it is said, "Knowledge
puffeth up, but love edifieth."563 The passage runs thus: "We know that we all have knowledge.
Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth." The apostle certainly had no desire to be
puffed up; but he had knowledge, because knowledge joined with love not only does not
puff up, but strengthens. So the letter when joined with the spirit, and the law when joined
with grace, is no longer the letter and the law in the same sense as when by itself it kills by
abounding sin. In this sense the law is even called the strength of sin, because its strict
prohibitions increase the fatal pleasure of sin. Even thus, however, the law is not evil; but
"sin, that it may appear sin, works death by that which is good." So things that are not evil
may often be hurtful to certain people. The Manichæans, when they have sore eyes, will
shut out their god the sun. The bride of Christ, then, is dead to the law, that is, to sin, which
abounds more from the prohibition of the law; for the law apart from grace commands, but
does not enable. Being dead to the law in this sense, that she may be married to another
who rose from the dead, she makes this distinction without any reproach to the law, which
would be blasphemy against its author. This is thy crime; for though the apostle tells thee
that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good, thou dost not acknowledge
it as the production of a good being. Its author thou makest to be one of the princes
of darkness. Here the truth confronts thee. They are the words of the Apostle Paul: "The
law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Such is the law given by Him
who appointed for a great symbolical use the tablets which thou foolishly deridest. The
same law which was given by Moses becomes through Jesus Christ grace and truth; for the
spirit is joined to the letter, that the righteousness of the law might begin to be fulfilled,
which when unfulfilled only added the guilt of transgression. The law which is holy, and
just, and good, is the same law by which sin works death, and to which we must die, that
we may be married to another who rose from the dead. Hear what the apostle adds: "But
sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good, that sin by the
commandment might become exceeding sinful." Deaf and blind, dost thou not now hear
and see? "Sin wrought death in me," he says, "by that which is good." The law is always
good: whether it hurts those who are destitute of grace, or benefits those who are filled with
grace, itself is always good; as the sun is always good, for every creature of God is good,
<note type="footnote">562 Rom. vii. 7-13.</note>
<note type="footnote">563 1 Cor. viii. 1.</note>

<pb n="375"/>
whether it hurts weak eyes or gladdens the sight of the healthy. Grace fits the mind for
keeping the law, as health fits the eyes for seeing the sun. And as healthy eyes die not to the
pleasure of seeing the sun, but to that painful effect of the rays which beat upon the eye so
as to increase the darkness; so the mind, healed by the love of the spirit, dies not to the justice
of the law, but to the guilt and transgression which followed on the law in the absence of
grace. So it is said "The law is good, if used lawfully;" and immediately after of the same
law, "Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man." The man who delights
in righteousness itself, does not require the restraint of the letter.</p>
<p>9. The bride of Christ rejoices in the hope of full salvation, and desires for thee a happy
conversion from fables to truth. She desires that the fear of Adoneus, as if he were a strange
lover, may not prevent thy escape from the seductions of the wily serpent. Adonai is a
Hebrew word, meaning Lord, as applied only to God. In the same way the Greek word
latria means service, in the sense of the service of God; and Amen means true, in a special
sacred sense. This is to be learned only from the Hebrew Scriptures, or from a translation.
The Church of Christ understands and loves these names, without regarding the evils of
those who scoff because they are ignorant. What she does not yet understand, she believes
may be explained, as similar things have already been explained to her. If she is charged
with loving Emmanuel, she laughs at the ignorance of the accuser, and holds fast by the
truth of this name. If she is charged with loving Messiah, she scorns her powerless adversary,
and clings to her anointed Master. Her prayer for thee is, that thou also mayest be cured
of thy errors, and be built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. The monstrosity
with which thou ignorantly chargest the true doctrine, is really to be found in the world
which, according to thy fanciful stories, is made partly of thy god and partly of the world
of darkness. This world, half savage and half divine, is worse than monstrous. The view of
such follies should make thee humble and penitent, and should lead thee to shun the serpent,
who seduces thee into such errors. If thou dost not believe what Moses says of the guile of
the serpent, thou mayest be warned by Paul, who, when speaking of presenting the Church
as a chaste virgin to Christ, says, "I fear lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his craftiness,
your minds also should be corrupted from the simplicity and purity which is in Christ." 564
In spite of this warning, thou hast been so misled, so infatuated by the serpent’s fatal enchantments,
that while he has persuaded other heretics to believe various falsehoods, he has
persuaded thee to believe that he is Christ. Others, though fallen into the maze of manifold
error, still admit the truth of the apostle’s warning. But thou art so far gone in corruption,
and so lost to shame, that thou holdest as Christ the very being by whom the apostle declares
that Eve was beguiled, and against whom he thus seeks to put the virgin bride of Christ on
her guard. Thy heart is darkened by the deceiver, who intoxicates thee with dreams of glit-

<pb n="376"/>
tering groves. What are these promises but dreams? What reason is there to believe them
true? O drunken, but not with wine!</p>
<p>10. Thou hast the impious audacity to accuse the God of the prophets of not fulfilling
His promises even to His servants the Jews. Thou dost not mention, however, any promise
that is unfulfilled; otherwise it might be shown, either that the promise has been fulfilled,
and so that thou dost not understand it, or that it is yet to be fulfilled, and so that thou dost
not believe it. What promise has been fulfilled to thee, to make it probable that thou wilt
obtain new worlds gained from the region of darkness? If there are prophets who predict
the Manichæans with praise, and if it is said that the existence of the sect is a fulfillment of
this prediction, it must first be proved that these predictions were not forged by Manichæus
in order to gain followers. He does not consider falsehood sinful. If he declares in praise
of Christ that He showed false marks of wounds in His body, he can have no scruple about
showing false predictions in his sheepskin volumes. Assuredly there are predictions of the
Manichæans, less clear in the prophets, and most explicit in the apostle. For example: "The
Spirit," he says, "speaketh expressly, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith,
giving heed to seducing spirits, and to doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having
their conscience seared, forbidding to marry, abstaining from meats, which God has created
to be received with thanksgiving by believers, and those who know the truth. For every
creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving."565
The fulfillment of this in the Manichæans is as clear as day to all that know them, and has
already been proved as fully as time permits.</p>
<p>11. She whom the apostle warns against the guile of the serpent by which thou hast
been corrupted, that he may present her as a chaste virgin to Christ, her only husband, acknowledges
the God of the prophets as the true God, and her own God. So many of His
promises have already been fulfilled to her, that she looks confidently for the fulfillment of
the rest. Nor can any one say that these prophecies have been forged to suit the present
time, for they are found in the books of the Jews. What could be more unlikely than that
all nations should be blessed in Abraham’s seed, as it was promised? And yet how plainly
is this promise now fulfilled! The last promise is made in the following short prophecy:
"Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house: they shall ever praise Thee."566 When trial is
past, and death, the last enemy, is destroyed, there will be rest in the constant occupation
of praising God, where there shall be no arrivals and no departures. So the prophet says
elsewhere: "Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; celebrate thy God, O Zion: for He hath
strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee."567 The gates

are shut, so that none can go in or out. The Bridegroom Himself says in the Gospel, that
He will not open to the foolish virgins though they knock. This Jerusalem, the holy Church,
the bride of Christ, is described fully in the Revelation of John. And that which commends
the promises of future bliss to the belief of this chaste virgin is, that now she is in possession
of what was foretold of her by the same prophets. For she is thus described: "Hearken, O
daughter, and regard, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s
house. For the King hath greatly desired thy beauty; and He is thy God. The daughters of
Tyre shall worship Him with gifts; the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor. The
daughter of the King is all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought gold. The virgins
following her shall be brought unto the King: her companions shall be brought unto thee;
with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought into the temple of the King. Instead of
thy fathers, children shall be born to thee, whom thou shall make princes over all the earth.
Thy name shall be remembered to all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for
ever and ever."568 Unhappy victim of the serpent’s guile, the inward beauty of the daughter
of the King is not for thee even to think of. For this purity of mind is that which thou hast
lost in opening thine eyes to love and worship the sun and moon. And so by the just judgment
of God thou art estranged from the tree of life, which is eternal and internal wisdom;
and with thee nothing is called or accounted truth or wisdom but that light which enters
the eyes opened to evil, and which in thy impure mind expands and shapes itself into
fanciful images. These are thy abominable whoredoms. Still the truth calls on thee to reflect
and return. Return to me, and thou shall be cleansed and restored, if thy shame leads thee
to repentance. Hear these words of the true Truth, who neither with feigned shapes fought
against the race of darkness, nor with feigned blood redeemed thee.</p>

<p>Faustus willing to believe not only that the Jewish but that all Gentile prophets wrote of Christ,
if it should be proved; but he would none the less insist upon rejecting their superstitions.
Augustin maintains that all Moses wrote is of Christ, and that his writings must be either
accepted or rejected as a whole.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You ask why we do not believe Moses, when Christ says, "Moses wrote
of me; and if ye believed Moses, ye would also believe me." I should be glad if not only
Moses, but all prophets, Jew and Gentile, had written of Christ. It would be no hindrance,
but a help to our faith, if we could cull testimonies from all hands agreeing in favor of our
God. You could extract the prophecies of Christ out of the superstition which we should
hate as much as ever. I am quite willing to believe that Moses, though so much the opposite
of Christ, may seem to have written of Him. No one but would gladly find a flower in every
thorn, and food in every plant, and honey in every insect, although we would not feed on
insects or on grass, nor wear thorns as a crown. No one but would wish pearls to be found
in every deep, and gems in every land, and fruit on every tree. We may eat fish from the
sea without drinking the water. We may take the useful, and reject what is hurtful. And
why may we not take the prophecies of Christ from a religion the rites of which we condemn
as useless? This need not make us liable to be led into the bondage of the errors; for we do
not hate the unclean spirits less because they confessed plainly and openly that Jesus was
the Son of God. If any similar testimony is found in Moses, I will accept it. But I will not
on this account be brought into subjection to his law, which to my mind is pure Paganism.
There is no reason whatever for thinking that I can have any objections to receiving
prophecies of Christ from every spirit.</p>
<p>2. Since you have proved that Christ declared that Moses wrote of him, I should be very
grateful if you would show me what he has written. I have searched the Scriptures, as we
are told to do, and have found no prophecies of Christ, either because there are none, or
because I could not understand them. The only escape from this perplexity was in one or
other of two conclusions. Either this verse must be spurious, or Jesus a liar. As it is not
consistent with piety to suppose God a liar, I preferred to attribute falsehood to the writers,
rather than to the Author, of truth. Moreover, He Himself tells that those who came before
him were thieves and robbers, which applies first of all to Moses. And when, on the occasion
of His speaking of His own majesty, and calling Himself the light of the world, the Jews angrily
rejoined, "Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true," I do not find that
He appealed to the prophecies of Moses, as might have been expected. Instead of this, as
having no connection with the Jews, and receiving no testimony from their fathers, He
replied: "It is written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am one who bear

<pb n="379"/>
witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me."569 He referred to
the voice from heaven which all had heard: "This is my beloved Son, believe Him." I think
it likely that if Christ had said that Moses wrote of Him, the ingenious hostility of the Jews
would have led them at once to ask what He supposed Moses to have written. The silence
of the Jews is a proof that Jesus never made such a statement.</p>
<p>3. My chief reason, however, for suspecting the genuineness of this verse is what I said
before, that in all my search of the writings of Moses I have found no prophecy of Christ.
But now that I have found in you a reader of superior intelligence, I hope to learn something;
and I promise to be grateful if no feeling of ill-will prevents you from giving me the benefit
of your higher attainments, as your lofty style of reproof entitles me to expect from you. I
ask for instruction in whatever the writings of Moses contain about our God and Lord which
has escaped me in reading. I beseech you not to use the ignorant argument that Christ affirms
Moses to have written of Him. For suppose you had not to deal with me, as in my case there
is an obligation to believe Him whom I profess to follow, but with a Jew or a Gentile, in
reply to the statement that Moses wrote of Christ, they will ask for proofs. What shall we
say to them? We cannot quote Christ’s authority, for they do not believe in Him. We must
point out what Moses wrote.</p>
<p>4. What, then, shall we point to? Shall it be that passage which you often quote where
the God of Moses says to him: "I will raise up unto them from among their brethren a
prophet like unto thee?"570 But the Jew can see that this does not refer to Christ, and there
is every reason against our thinking that it does. Christ was not a prophet, nor was He like
Moses: for Moses was a man, and Christ was God; Moses was a sinner, and Christ sinless;
Moses was born by ordinary generation, and Christ of a virgin according to you, or, as I
hold, not born at all: Moses, for offending his God, was put to death on the mountain; and
Christ suffered voluntarily, and the Father was well pleased in Him. If we were to assert
that Christ was a prophet like Moses, the Jew would either deride us as ignorant or pronounce
us untruthful.</p>
<p>5. Or shall we take another favorite passage of yours: "They shall see their life hanging,
and shall not believe their life?"571 You insert the words "on a tree," which are not in the
original. Nothing can be easier than to show that this has no reference to Christ. Moses is
uttering dire threatenings in case the people should depart from his law, and says among
other things that they would be taken captive by their enemies, and would be expecting
<note type="footnote">569 John viii. 13, 17, 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">570 Deut. xviii. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">571 Deut. xxviii. 66.</note>

<pb n="380"/>
death day and night, having no confidence in the life allowed them by their conquerors, so
that their life would hang in uncertainty from fear of impending danger. This passage will
not do, we must try others. I cannot admit that the words, "Cursed is every one that hangeth
on a tree," refer to Christ, or when it is said that the prince or prophet must be killed who
should try to turn away the people from their God, or should break any of the commandments.
572 That Christ did this I am obliged to grant. But if you assert that these things were
written of Christ, it may be asked in reply, What spirit dictated these prophecies in which
Moses curses Christ and orders him to be killed? If he had the Spirit of God, these things
are not written of Christ; if they are written of Christ, he had not the Spirit of God. The
Spirit of God would not curse Christ, or order Him to be killed. To vindicate Moses, you
must confess that these passages too have no reference to Christ. So, if you have no others
to show, there are none. If there are none, Christ could not have said that there were; and
if Christ did not say so, that verse is spurious.</p>
<p>6. The next verse too is suspicious, "If ye believed Moses, ye would also believe me;" for
the religion of Moses is so entirely different from that of Christ, that if the Jews believed
one, they could not believe the other. Moses strictly forbids any work to be done on Sabbath,
and gives as a reason for this prohibition that God made the world and all that is therein in
six days, and rested on the seventh day, which is Sabbath; and therefore blessed or sanctified
it as His haven of repose after toil, and commanded that breaking the Sabbath should be
punished with death. The Jews, in obedience to Moses, insisted strongly on this, and so
would not even listen to Christ when He told them that God always works, and that no day
is appointed for the intermission of His pure and unwearied energy, and that accordingly
He Himself had to work incessantly even on Sabbath. "My Father," he says, "worketh always,
and I too must work." 573 Again, Moses places circumcision among the rites pleasing to
God, and commands every male to be circumcised in the foreskin of his flesh, and declares
that this is a necessary sign of the covenant which God made with Abraham, and that every
male not circumcised would be cut off from his tribe, and from his part in the inheritance
promised to Abraham and to his seed.574 In this observance, too, the Jews were very zealous,
and consequently could not believe in Christ, who made light of these things, and declared
that a man when circumcised became twofold a child of hell.575 Again, Moses is very particular
about the distinction in animal foods, and discourses like an epicure on the merits
of fish, and birds, and quadrupeds, and orders some to be eaten as clean, and others which
are unclean not to be touched. Among the unclean he reckons the swine and the hare, and
<note type="footnote">572 Deut. xiii. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">573 John v. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">574 Gen. xvii. 9-14.</note>
<note type="footnote">575 Matt. xxiii. 15.</note>

<pb n="381"/>
fish without scales, and quadrupeds that neither divide the hoof nor chew the cud. In this
also the Jews carefully obeyed Moses, and so could not believe in Christ, who taught that
all food is alike, and though he allowed no animal food to his own disciples, gave full liberty
to the laity to eat whatever they pleased, and taught that men are polluted not by what goes
into the mouth, but by the evil things which come out of it. In these and many other things
the doctrine of Jesus, as everybody knows, contradicts that of Moses.</p>
<p>7. Not to enumerate all the points of difference, it is enough to mention this one fact,
that most Christian sects, and, as is well known, the Catholics, pay no regard to what is
prescribed in the writings of Moses. If this does not originate in some error, but in the
doctrine correctly transmitted from Christ and His disciples, you surely must acknowledge
that the teaching of Jesus is opposed to that of Moses, and that the Jews did not believe in
Christ on account of their attachment to Moses. How can it be otherwise than false that
Jesus said to the Jews, "If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me also," when it is perfectly
clear that their belief in Moses prevented them from believing in Jesus, which they might
have done if they had left off believing in Moses? Again I ask you to show me anything that
Moses wrote of Christ.</p>
<p>8. Elsewhere Faustus says: When you find no passage to point to, you use this weak
and inappropriate argument, that a Christian is bound to believe Christ when he says that
Moses wrote of Him, and that whoever does not believe this is not a Christian. It would be
far better to confess at once that you cannot find any passage. This argument might be used
with me, because my reverence for Christ compels me to believe what He says. Still it may
be a question whether this is Christ’s own declaration, requiring absolute belief, or only the
writer’s, to be carefully examined. And disbelief in falsehood is no offence to Christ, but to
impostors. But of whatever use this argument may be with Christians, it is wholly inapplic-
able in the case of the Jew or Gentile, with whom we are supposed to be discussing. And
even with Christians the argument is objectionable. When the Apostle Thomas was in
doubt, Christ did not spurn him from Him. Instead of saying, "Believe, if thou art a disciple;
whoever does not believe is not a disciple," Christ sought to heal the wounds of his mind
by showing him the marks of the wounds in His own body. Does it become you then to tell
me that I am not a Christian because I am in doubt, not about Christ, but about the genuineness
of a remark attributed to Christ? But, you say, He calls those especially blessed, who
have not seen, and yet have believed. If you think that this refers to believing without the
use of judgment and reason, you are welcome to this blind blessedness. I shall be content
with rational blessedness.</p>
<p>9. Augustin replied: Your idea of taking any prophecies of Christ to be found in Moses,
as a fish out of the sea, while you throw away the water from which the fish is taken, is a
clever one. But since all that Moses wrote is of Christ, or relates to Christ, either as predicting
Him by words and actions, or as illustrating His grace and glory, you, with your faith in the

<pb n="382"/>
untrue and untruthful Christ from the writings of Manichæus, and your unbelief in Moses,
will not even eat the fish. Moreover, though you are sincere in your hostility to Moses, you
are hypocritical in your praise of fish. For how can you say that there is no harm in eating
a fish taken out of the sea, when your doctrine is that such food is so hurtful, that you would
rather starve than make use of it? If all flesh is unclean, as you say it is, and if the wretched
life of your god is confined in all water or plants, from which it is liberated by your using
them for food, according to your own vile superstition, you must throw away the fish you
have praised, and drink the water and eat the thistles you speak of as useless. As for your
comparison of the servant of God to devils, as if his prophecies of Christ resembled their
confession, the servant does not refuse to bear the reproach of his master. If the Master of
the house was called Beelzebub, how much more they of His household!576 You have learned
this reproach from Christ’s enemies; and you are worse than they were. They did not believe
that Jesus was Christ, and therefore thought Him an impostor. But the only doctrine you
believe in is that which dares to make Christ a liar.</p>
<p>10. What reason have you for saying that the law of Moses is pure Paganism? Is it because
it speaks of a temple, and an altar of sacrifices, and priests? But all these names are
found also in the New Testament. "Destroy," Christ says, "this temple, and in three days I
will raise it up;"577 and again, "When thou offerest thy gift at the altar;"578 and again, "Go,
show thyself to the priest, and offer for thyself a sacrifice as Moses commanded, for a testimony
unto them."579 What these things prefigured the Lord Himself partly tells us, when
He calls His own body the temple; and we learn also from the apostle, who says, "The temple
of God is holy, which temple ye are;"580 and again, "I beseech you therefore by the mercies
of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God;"581 and in
similar passages. As the same apostle says, in words which cannot be too often quoted, these
things were our examples, for they were not the work of devils, but of the one true God who
made heaven and earth, and who, though not needing such things, yet, suiting His requirements
to the time, made ancient observances significant of future realities. Since you pretend
to abhor Paganism, though it is only that you may lead astray by your deception unlearned
Christians or those not established in the faith, show us any authority in Christian books
for your worship and service of the sun and moon. Your heresy is liker Paganism than the
law of Moses is. For you do not worship Christ, but only something that you call Christ, a

fiction of your own fancy; and the gods you serve are either the bodies visible in the heavens,
or hosts of your own contrivance. If you do not build shrines for these worthless idols, the
creatures of the imagination, you make your hearts their temple.</p>
<p>11. You ask me to show what Moses wrote of Christ. Many passages have already been
pointed out. But who could point out all? Besides, when any quotation is made, you are
ready perversely to try to give the words another meaning; or if the evidence is too strong
to be resisted, you will say that you take the passage as a sweet fish out of the salt water, and
that you will not therefore consent to drink all the brine of the books of Moses. It will be
enough, then, to take those passages in the Hebrew law which Faustus has chosen for criticism,
and to show that, when rightly understood, they apply to Christ. For if the things
which our adversary ridicules and condemns are made to prove that he himself is condemned
by Christian truth, it will be evident that either the mere quotation or the careful examination
of the other passages will be enough to show their agreement with Christian faith. Well,
then, O thou full of all subtilty, when the Lord in the Gospel says, "If ye believed Moses, ye
would believe me also, for he wrote of me,"582 there is no occasion for the great perplexity
you pretend to be in, or for the alternative of either pronouncing this verse spurious or
calling Jesus a liar. The verse is as genuine as its words are true. I preferred, says Faustus,
to attribute falsehood to the writers, rather than to the Author of truth. What sort of faith
can you have in Christ as the author of truth, when your doctrine is that His flesh and His
death, His wounds and their marks, were feigned? And where is your authority for saying
that Christ is the author of truth, if you dare to attribute falsehood to those who wrote of
Him, whose testimony has come down to us with the confirmation of those immediately
succeeding them? You have not seen Christ, nor has He conversed with you as with the
apostles, nor called you from heaven as He did Saul. What knowledge or belief can we have
of Christ, but on the authority of Scripture? Or if there is falsehood in the Gospel which
has been widely published among all nations, and has been held in such high sacredness in
all churches since the name of Christ was first preached, where shall we find a trustworthy
record of Christ? If the Gospel is called in question in spite of the general consent regarding
it, there can be no writing which a man may not call spurious if he does not wish to believe
it.</p>
<p>12. You go on to quote Christ’s words, that all who came before Him were thieves and
robbers. How do you know that these were Christ’s words, but from the Gospel? You
profess faith in these words, as if you had heard them from the mouth of the Lord Himself.
But if any one declares the verse to be spurious, and denies that Christ said this, you will
have, in reply, to exert yourself in vindication of the authority of the Gospel. Unhappy being!
what you refuse to believe is written in the same place as that which you quote as spoken
<note type="footnote">582 John v. 46.</note>

<pb n="384"/>
by the Lord Himself. We believe both, for we believe the sacred narrative in which both are
contained. We believe both that Moses wrote of Christ, and that all that came before Christ
were thieves and robbers. By their coming He means their not being sent. Those who were
sent, as Moses and the holy prophets, came not before Him, but with Him. They did not
proudly wish to precede Him, but were the humble bearers of the message which He uttered
by them. According to the meaning which you give to the Lord’s words, it is plain that with
you there can be no prophets. And so you have made a Christ for yourselves who should
prophesy a Christ to come. If you have any prophets of your own, they will have, of course,
no authority, as not being recognized by any others; but if there are any that you dare to
quote as prophesying that Christ would come in an unreal body, and would suffer an unreal
death, and would show to His doubting disciples unreal marks of wounds, not to speak of
the abominable nature of such prophecies, and of the evident untruthfulness of those who
commend falsehood in Christ, by your own interpretation those prophets must have been
thieves and robbers, for they could not have spoken of Christ as coming in any manner
unless they had come before Him. If by those who came before Christ we understand those
who would not come with Him,—that is, with the Word of God,—but without being sent
by God brought their own falsehoods to men, you yourselves, although you are born in this
world after the death and the resurrection of Christ, are thieves and robbers. For, without
waiting for His illumination that you might preach His truth, you have come before Him
to preach up your own deceits.</p>
<p>13. In the passage where we read of the Jews saying to Christ, Thou bearest witness of
thyself, thy witness is not true, you do not see that Christ replies by saying that Moses wrote
of Him, simply because you have not got the eye of piety to see with. The answer of Christ
is this: "It is written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true; I am one who bear
witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me." 583 What does this
mean, if rightly understood, but that this number of witnesses required by the law was fixed
upon and consecrated in the spirit of prophecy, that even thus might be prefigured the future
revelation of the Father and Son, whose spirit is the Holy Spirit of the inseparable Trinity?
So it is written: "In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."584
As a matter of fact, one witness generally speaks the truth, while a number tell lies. And the
world, in its conversion to Christianity, believed one apostle preaching the gospel rather
than the mistaken multitude who persecuted him. There was a special reason for requiring
this number of witnesses, and in His answer the Lord implied that Moses prophesied of
<note type="footnote">583 John viii. 17, 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">584 Deut. xix. 15.</note>

<pb n="385"/>
Him. Do you carp at His saying your law instead of the law of God? But, as every one
knows, this is the common expression in Scripture. Your law means the law given to you.
So the apostle speaks of his gospel, while at the same time he declares that he received it not
from man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. You might as well say that Christ denies
God to be His Father, when He uses the words your Father instead of our Father. Again,
you should refuse to believe the voice which you allude to as having come from heaven,
This is my beloved Son, believe Him, because you did not hear it. But if you believe this
because you find it in the sacred Scriptures, you will also find there what you deny, that
Moses wrote of Christ, besides many other things that you do not acknowledge as true. Do
you not see that your own mischievous argument may be used to prove that this voice never
came from heaven? To your own destruction, and to the detriment of the welfare of mankind,
you try to weaken the authority of the gospel, by arguing that it cannot be true that Christ
said that Moses wrote of Him; because if He had said this, the ingenious hostility of the Jews
would have led them at once to ask what He supposed Moses to have written of Him. In
the same way, it might be impiously argued that if that voice had really come from heaven,
all the Jews who heard it would have believed. Why are you so unreasonable as not to consider
that, as it was possible for the Jews to remain hardened in unbelief after hearing the
voice from heaven, so it was possible for them, when Christ said that Moses wrote of Him,
to refrain from asking what Moses wrote, because in their ingenious hostility they were
afraid of being proved to be in the wrong?</p>
<p>14. Besides that this argument is an impious assault on the gospel, Faustus himself is
aware of its feebleness, and therefore insists more on what he calls his chief difficulty,—that
in all his search of the writings of Moses he has found no prophecies of Christ. The obvious
reply is, that he does not understand. And if any one asks why he does not understand, the
answer is that he reads with a hostile, unbelieving mind; he does not search in order to know,
but thinks he knows when he is ignorant. This vainglorious presumption either blinds the
eye of his understanding so as to prevent his seeing anything, or distorts his vision, so that
his remarks of approval or disapproval are misdirected. I ask, he says, for instruction in
whatever the writings of Moses contain about our God and Lord, which has escaped me in
reading. I reply at once that it has all escaped him, for all is written of Christ. As we cannot
go through the whole, I will, with the help of God, comply with your request, to the extent
I have already promised, by showing that the passages which you specially criticise refer to
Christ. You tell me not to use the ignorant argument that Christ affirms Moses to have
written of Him. But if I use this argument, it is not because I am ignorant, but because I am
a believer. I acknowledge that this argument will not convince a Gentile or a Jew. But, in
spite of all your evasions, you are obliged to confess that it tells against you, who boast of
possessing a kind of Christianity. You say, Suppose you had not to deal with me, as in my
case there is an obligation to believe Him whom I profess to follow, but with a Jew or a

<pb n="386"/>
Gentile. This is as much as to say that you, at any rate, with whom I have at present to do,
are satisfied that Moses wrote of Christ; for you are not bold enough to discard altogether
the well-grounded authority of the Gospel where Christ’s own declaration is recorded. Even
when you attack this authority indirectly, you feel that you are attacking your own position.
You are aware that if you refuse to believe the Gospel, which is so generally known and received,
you must fail utterly in the attempt to substitute for it any trustworthy record of the
sayings and doings of Christ. You are afraid that the loss of the Christian name might lead
to the exposure of your absurdities to universal scorn and condemnation. Accordingly you
try to recover yourself, by saying that your profession of Christianity obliges you to believe
these words of the Gospel. So you, at any rate, which is all that we need care for just now,
are caught and slain in this death blow to your errors. You are forced to confess that Moses
wrote of Christ, because the Gospel, which your profession obliges you to believe, states
that Christ said so. As regards a discussion with a Jew or a Gentile, I have already shown
as well as I could how I think it should be conducted.</p>
<p>15. I still hold that there is a reference to Christ in the passage which you select for refutation,
where God says to Moses, "I will raise up unto them from among their brethren a
prophet like unto thee."585 The string of showy antitheses with which you try to ornament
your dull discourse does not at all affect my belief of this truth. You attempt to prove, by a
comparison of Christ and Moses, that they are unlike, and that therefore the words, "I will
raise up a prophet like unto thee," cannot be understood of Christ. You specify a number
of particulars in which you find a diversity: that the one is man, and the other God; that
one is a sinner, the other sinless; that one is born of ordinary generation, the other, as we
hold, of a virgin, and, as you hold, not even of a virgin; the one incurs God’s anger, and is
put to death on a mountain, the other suffers voluntarily, having throughout the approval
of His Father. But surely things may be said to be like, although they are not like in every
respect. Besides the resemblance between things of the same nature, as between two men,
or between parents and children, or between men in general, or any species of animals, or
in trees, between one olive and another, or one laurel and another, there is often a resemblance
in things of a different nature, as between a wild and a tame olive, or between wheat
and barley. These things are to some extent allied. But there is the greatest possible distance
between the Son of God, by whom all things were made, and a beast or a stone. And yet in
the Gospel we read, "Behold the Lamb of God,"586 and in the apostle, "That rock was
Christ."587 This could not be said except on the supposition of some resemblance. What
wonder, then, if Christ condescended to become like Moses, when He was made like the

<pb n="387"/>
lamb which God by Moses commanded His people to eat as a type of Christ, enjoining that
its blood should be used as a means of protection, and that it should be called the Passover,
which every one must admit to be fulfilled in Christ? The Scripture, I acknowledge, shows
points of difference; and the Scripture also, as I call on you to acknowledge, shows points
of resemblance. There are points of both kinds, and one can be proved as well as the other.
Christ is unlike man, for He is God; and it is written of Him that He is "over all, God blessed
for ever."588 Christ is also like man, for He is man; and it is likewise written of Him, that
He is the "Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus."589 Christ is unlike a
sinner, for He is ever holy; and He is like a sinner, for "God sent His Son in the likeness of
sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh."590 Christ is unlike a man born
in ordinary generation, for He was born of a virgin; and yet He is like, for He too was born
of a woman, to whom it was said, "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called
the Son of God."591 Christ is unlike a man, who dies on account of his own sin, for He died
without sin, and of His own free-will; and again, He is like, for He too died a real death of
the body.</p>
<p>16. You ought not to say, in disparagement of Moses, that he was a sinner, and that he
was put to death on a mountain because his God was angry with him. For Moses could
glory in the Lord as his Saviour, who is also the Saviour of him who says, "Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief."592 Moses, indeed, is accused by the
voice of God, because his faith showed signs of weakness when he was commanded to draw
water out of the rock.593 In this he may have sinned as Peter did, when from the weakness
of his faith he became afraid in the midst of the waves.594 But we cannot think from this,
that he who, as the Gospel tells us, was counted worthy to be present with the Lord along
with holy Elias on the mount of transfiguration, was separated from the eternal fellowship
of the saints. The sacred history shows in what favor he was with God even after his sin.
But since you may ask why God speaks of this sin as deserving the punishment of death,
and as I have promised to point out prophecies of Christ in those passages which you select
for criticism, I will try, with the Lord’s help, to show that what you object to in the death of
Moses is, when rightly understood, prophetical of Christ.</p>

<p>17. We often find in the symbolical passages of Scripture, that the same person appears
in different characters on different occasions. So, on this occasion, Moses represents and
prefigures the Jewish people as placed under the law. As, then, Moses, when he struck the
rock with his rod, doubted the power of God, so the people who were under the law given
by Moses, when they nailed Christ to the cross, did not believe Him to be the power of God.
And as water flowed from the smitten rock for those that were athirst, so life comes to believers
from the stroke of the Lord’s passion. The testimony of the apostle is clear and decisive
on this point, when he says, "This rock was Christ."595 In the command of God, that
the death of the flesh of Moses should take place on the mountain, we see the divine appointment
that the carnal doubt of the divinity of Christ should die on Christ’s exaltation. As
the rock is Christ, so is the mountain. The rock is the fortitude of His humiliation; the
mountain the height of His exaltation. For as the apostle says, "This rock was Christ," so
Christ Himself says, "A city set upon an hill cannot be hid," 596 showing that He is the hill,
and believers the city built upon the glory of His name. The carnal mind lives when, like
the smitten rock, the humiliation of Christ on the cross is despised. For Christ crucified is
to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness. And the carnal mind dies
when, like the mountain-top, Christ is seen in His exaltation. "For to them that are called,
both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom of God."597 Moses
therefore ascended the mount, that in the death of the flesh he might be received by the
living spirit. If Faustus had ascended, he would not have uttered carnal objections from a
dead mind. It was the carnal mind that made Peter dread the smiting of the rock, when, on
the occasion of the Lord’s foretelling His passion, he said, "Be it far from Thee, Lord; spare
Thyself." And this sin too was severely rebuked, when the Lord replied, "Get thee behind
me, Satan; thou art an offense unto me: for thou savorest not the things which be of God,
but those which be of men."598 And where did this carnal distrust die but in the glorification
of Christ, as on a mountain height? If it was alive when Peter timidly denied Christ, it was
dead when he fearlessly preached Him. It was alive in Saul, when, in his aversion to the offense
of the cross, he made havoc of the Christian faith, and where but on this mountain
had it died, when Paul was able to say, "I live no longer, but Christ liveth in me?"599</p>
<p>18. What other reason has your heretical folly to give for thinking that there is no
prophecy of Christ in the words, "I will raise up unto them a Prophet from among their
brethren, like unto thee?" Your showing Christ to be unlike Moses is no reason; for we can

<pb n="389"/>
show that in other respects He is like. How can you object to Christ’s being called a
prophet, since He condescended to be a man, and actually foretold many future events?
What is a prophet, but one who predicts events beyond human foresight? So Christ says of
Himself: "A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country."600 But, turning from
you, since you have already acknowledged that your profession of Christianity obliges you
to believe the Gospel, I address myself to the Jew, who enjoys the poor privilege of liberty
from the yoke of Christ, and who therefore thinks it allowable to say: Your Christ spoke
falsely; Moses wrote nothing of him.</p>
<p>19. Let the Jews say what prophet is meant in this promise of God to Moses: "I will
raise up unto them a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee." Many prophets
appeared after Moses; but one in particular is here pointed out. The Jews will perhaps naturally
think of the successor of Moses, who led into the promised land the people that Moses
had brought out of Egypt. Having this successor of Moses in his mind, he may perhaps
laugh at me for asking to what prophet the words of the promise refer, since it is recorded
who followed Moses in ruling and leading the people. When he has laughed at my ignorance,
as Faustus supposes him to do, I will still continue my inquiries, and will desire my laughing
opponent to give me a serious answer to the question why Moses changed the name of this
successor, who was preferred to himself as the leader of the people into the promised land,
to show that the law given by Moses not to save, but to convince the sinner, cannot lead us
into heaven, but only the grace and truth which are by Jesus Christ. This successor was
called Osea, and Moses gave him the name of Jesus. Why then did he give him this name
when he sent him from the valley of Pharan into the land into which he was to lead the
people?601 The true Jesus says, "If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
receive you unto myself."602 I will ask the Jew if the prophet does not show the prophetical
meaning of these things when he says, "God shall come from Africa, and the Holy One from
Pharan." Does this not mean that the holy God would come with the name of him who
came from Africa by Pharan, that is, with the name of Jesus? Then, again, it is the Word of
God Himself who speaks when He promises to provide this successor to Moses, speaking
of him as an angel,—a name commonly given in Scripture to those carrying any message.
The words are: "Behold I send my angel before thy face, to preserve thee in the way, and to
bring thee into the land which I have sworn to give thee. Take heed unto him, and obey,
and beware of unbelief in him; for he will not take anything from thee wrongfully, for my
name is in him."603 Consider these words. Let the Jew, not to speak of the Manichæan, say
<note type="footnote">600 Matt. xiii. 57.</note>
<note type="footnote">601 Num. xiii. 9, xiv. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">602 John xiv. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">603 Ex. xxiii. 20, 21.</note>

<pb n="390"/>
what other angel he can find in Scripture to whom these words apply, but this leader who
was to bring the people into the land of promise. Then let him inquire who it was that
succeeded Moses, and brought in the people. He will find that it was Jesus, and that this
was not his name at first, but after his name was changed. It follows that He who said, "My
name is in him," is the true Jesus, the leader who brings His people into the inheritance of
eternal life, according to the New Testament, of which the Old was a figure. No event or
action could have a more distinctly prophetical character than this, where the very name is
a prediction.</p>
<p>20. It follows that this Jew, if he wishes to be a Jew inwardly, in the spirit, and not in
the letter, if he wishes to be thought a true Israelite, in whom is no guile, will recognize in
this dead Jesus, who led the people into the land of mortality, a figure of the true living Jesus,
whom he may follow into the land of life. In this way, he will no longer in a hostile spirit
resist so plain a prophecy, but, influenced by the allusion to the Jesus of the Old Testament,
he will be prepared to listen meekly to Him whose name he bore, and who leads to the true
land of promise; for He says, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the land."604 The
Gentile also, if his heart is not too stony, if he is one of those stones from which God raises
up children unto Abraham, must allow it to be wonderful that in the ancient books of the
people of whom Jesus was born, so plain a prophecy, including His very name, is found recorded;
and must remark at the same time, that it is not any man of the name of Jesus who
is prophesied of, but a divine person, because God said that His name was in that man who
was appointed to rule the people, and to lead them into the kingdom, and who by a change
of name was called Jesus. In His being sent with this new name, He brings a great and divine
message, and is therefore called an Angel, which, as every tyro in Greek knows, means
messenger. No Gentile, therefore, if he were not perverse and obstinate, would despise these
books merely because he is not subject to the law of the Hebrews, to whom the books belong;
but would think highly of the books, no matter whose they were, on finding in them
prophecies of such ancient date, and of what he sees now taking place. Instead of despising
Christ Jesus because He is foretold in the Hebrew Scriptures, he would conclude that one
thought worthy of being the subject of prophetic description, whoever the writers might
be, for so many ages before His coming into the world,—sometimes in plain announcements,
sometimes in figure by symbolic actions and utterances,—must claim to be regarded with
profound admiration and reverence, and to be followed with implicit reliance. Thus the
facts of Christian history would prove the truth of the prophecy, and the prophecy would
prove the claims of Christ. Call this fancy, if it is not actually the case that men all over the
world have been led, and are now led, to believe in Christ by reading these books.</p>
<note type="footnote">604 Matt. v. 4.</note>

<pb n="391"/>
<p>21. In view of the multitudes from all nations who have become zealous believers in
these books, it is laughably absurd to tell us that it is impossible to persuade a Gentile to
learn the Christian faith from Jewish books. Indeed, it is a great confirmation of our faith
that such important testimony is borne by enemies. The believing Gentiles cannot suppose
these testimonies to Christ to be recent forgeries; for they find them in books held sacred
for so many ages by those who crucified Christ, and still regarded with the highest veneration
by those who every day blaspheme Christ. If the prophecies of Christ were the production
of the preachers of Christ, we might suspect their genuineness. But now the preacher expounds
the text of the blasphemer. In this way the Most High God orders the blindness of
the ungodly for the profit of the saint, in His righteous government bringing good out of
evil, that those who by their own choice live wickedly may be, in His just judgment, made
the instruments of His will. So, lest those that were to preach Christ to the world should be
thought to have forged the prophecies which speak of Christ as to be born, to work miracles,
to suffer unjustly, to die, to rise again, to ascend to heaven, to publish the gospel of eternal
life among all nations, the unbelief of the Jews has been made of signal benefit to us; so that
those who do not receive in their heart for their own good these truths, carry, in their hands
for our benefit the writings in which these truths are contained. And the unbelief of the
Jews increases rather than lessens the authority of the books, for this blindness is itself
foretold. They testify to the truth by their not understanding it. By not understanding the
books which predict that they would not understand, they prove these books to be true.</p>
<p>22. In the passage, "Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life,"605
Faustus is deceived by the ambiguity of the words. The words may be differently interpreted;
but that they cannot be understood of Christ is not said by Faustus, nor can be said by
anyone who does not deny that Christ is life, or that He was seen by the Jews hanging on
the cross, or that they did not believe Him. Since Christ Himself says, "I am the life,"606 and
since there is no doubt that He was seen hanging by the unbelieving Jews, I see no reason
for doubting that this was written of Christ; for, as Christ says, Moses wrote of Him. Since
we have already refuted Faustus’ arguments by which he tries to show that the words, "I will
raise up from among their brethren a prophet like unto thee," do not apply to Christ, because
Christ is not like Moses, we need not insist on this other prophecy. Since, in the one case,
his argument is that Christ is unlike Moses, so here he ought to argue that Christ is not the
life, or that He was not seen hanging by the unbelieving Jews. But as he has not said this,
and as no one will now venture to say so, there should be no difficulty in accepting this too
as a prophecy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, uttered by His servant. These words,
says Faustus, occur in a chapter of curses. But why should it be the less a prophecy because
<note type="footnote">605 Deut. xxviii. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">606 John xiv. 6.</note>

<pb n="392"/>
it occurs in the midst of prophecies? Or why should it not be a prophecy of Christ, although
the context does not seem to refer to Christ? Indeed, among all the curses which the Jews
brought on themselves by their sinful pride, nothing could be worse than this, that they
should see their Life—that is, the Son of God —hanging, and should not believe their Life.
For the curses of prophecy are not hostile imprecations, but announcements of coming
judgment. Hostile imprecations are forbidden, for it is said, "Bless, and curse not."607 But
prophetic announcements are often found in the writings of the saints, as when the Apostle
Paul says: "Alexander the coppersmith has done me much evil; the Lord shall reward him
according to his works."608 So it might be thought that the apostle was prompted by angry
feeling to utter this imprecation: "I would that they were even made eunuchs that trouble
you."609 But if we remember who the writer is, we may see in this ambiguous expression
an ingenious style of benediction. For there are eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs
for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.610 If Faustus had a pious appetite for Christian
food, he would have found a similar ambiguity in the words of Moses. By the Jews the declaration,
"Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life," may have been
understood to mean that they would see their life to be in danger from the threats and plots
of their enemies, and would not expect to live. But the child of the Gospel, who has heard
Christ say, "He wrote of me," distinguishes in the ambiguity of the prophecy between what
is thrown to swine and what is addressed to man. To his mind the thought immediately
suggests itself of Christ hanging as the life of man, and of the Jews not believing in Him for
this very reason, that they saw Him hanging. As to the objection that these words, "Thou
shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life," are the only words referring to Christ
in a passage containing maledictions not applicable to Christ, some might grant that this is
true. For this prophecy might very well occur among the curses pronounced by the
prophet upon the ungodly people, for these curses are of different kinds. But I, and those
who with me consider more closely the saying of the Lord in His Gospel, which is not, He
wrote also of me, as admitting that Moses wrote other things not referring to Christ, but,
"He wrote of me," as teaching that in searching the Scriptures we should view them as intended
solely to illustrate the grace of Christ, see a reference to Christ in the rest of the passage
also. But it would take too much time to explain this here.</p>
<p>23. So far from these words of Faustus’ quotation being proved not to refer to Christ
by their occurring among the other curses, these curses cannot be rightly understood except
as prophecies of the glory of Christ, in which lies the happiness of man. And what is true
<note type="footnote">607 Rom. xii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">608 2 Tim. iv. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">609 Gal. v. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">610 Matt. xix. 12.</note>

<pb n="393"/>
of these curses is still more true of this quotation. If it could be said of Moses that his words
have a different meaning from what was in his mind, I would rather suppose him to have
prophesied without knowing it, than allow that the words, "Thou shalt see thy life hanging,
and shalt not believe thy life," are not applicable to Christ. So the words of Caiaphas had a
different meaning from what he intended, when, in his hostility to Christ, he said that it
was expedient that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not
perish, where the Evangelist added that he said this not of himself, but, since he was high
priest, he prophesied. 611 But Moses was not Caiaphas; and therefore when Moses said to
the Hebrew people, "Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life," he not
only spoke of Christ, as he certainly did, even though he spoke without knowing the
meaning of what he said, but he knew that he spoke of Christ. For he was a most faithful
steward of the prophetic mystery, that is, of the priestly unction which gives the knowledge
of the name of Christ; and in this mystery even Caiaphas, wicked as he was, was able to
prophesy without knowing it. The prophetic unction enabled him to prophesy, though his
wicked life prevented him from knowing it. Who then can say that there are no prophecies
of Christ in Moses, with whom began that unction to which we owe the knowledge of Christ’s
name, and by which even Caiaphas, the persecutor of Christ, prophesied of Christ without
knowing it?</p>
<p>24. We have already said as much as appeared desirable of the curse pronounced on
every one that hangs on a tree. Enough has been said to show that the command to kill any
prophet or prince who tried to turn away the children of Israel from their God, or to break
any commandment, is not directed against Christ. The more we consider the words and
actions of our Lord Jesus Christ, the more clearly will this appear; for Christ never tried to
turn away any of the Israelites from their God. The God whom Moses taught the people to
love and serve, is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, whom the Lord Jesus Christ
speaks of by this name, using the name in refutation of the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection
of the dead. He says, "Of the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what God
said from the bush to Moses, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto Him."612 In the
same words with which Christ answered the Sadducees we may answer the Manichæans,
for they too deny the resurrection, though in a different way. Again, when Christ said, in
praise of the centurion’s faith, "Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no,
not in Israel," He added, "And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and from
the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;
but the children of the kingdom shall go into outer darkness."613 If, then, as Faustus must

<pb n="394"/>
admit, the God of whom Moses spoke was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, of
whom Christ also spoke, as these passages prove, it follows that Christ did not try to turn
away the people from their God. On the contrary, He warned them that they would go into
outer darkness, because He saw that they were turned away from their God, in whose
kingdom He says the Gentiles called from the whole world will sit down with Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob; implying that they would believe in the God of Abraham, and of Isaac,
and of Jacob. So the apostle also says: "The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all
nations be blessed."614 It is implied that those who are blessed in the seed of Abraham shall
imitate the faith of Abraham. Christ, then, did not try to turn away the Israelites from their
God, but rather charged them with being turned away. The idea that Christ broke one of
the commandments given by Moses is not a new one, for the Jews thought so; but it is a
mistake, for the Jews were in the wrong. Let Faustus mention the commandment which he
supposes the Lord to have broken, and we will point out his mistake, as we have done already,
when it was required. Meanwhile it is enough to say, that if the Lord had broken any commandment,
He could not have found fault with the Jews for doing so. For when the Jews
blamed His disciples for eating with unwashen hands, in which they transgressed not a
commandment of God, but the traditions of the elders, Christ said, "Why do ye also transgress
the commandment of God, that ye may observe your traditions?" He then quotes a commandment
of God, which we know to have been given by Moses. "For God said," He adds,
"Honor thy father and mother, and he that curseth father or mother shall die the death. But
ye say, Whoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest
be profited by me, is not obliged to honor his father. So ye make the word of God of none
effect by your traditions."615 From this several things maybe learned: that Christ did not
turn away the Jews from their God; that He not only did not Himself break God’s commandments,
but found fault with those who did so; and that it was God Himself who gave these
commandments by Moses.</p>
<p>25. In fulfillment of our promise that we would prove the reference to Christ in those
passages selected by Faustus from the writings of Moses for adverse criticism, since we
cannot here point out the reference to Christ which we believe to exist in all the writings of
Moses, it becomes our duty to show that this commandment of Moses, that every prophet
or prince should be killed who tried to turn away the people from their God, or to break
any commandment, refers to the preservation of the faith which is taught in the Church of
Christ. Moses no doubt knew in the spirit of prophecy, and from what he himself heard
from God, that many heretics would arise to teach errors of all kinds against the doctrine
<note type="footnote">614 Gal. iii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">615 Matt. xv. 3-6.</note>

<pb n="395"/>
of Christ, and to preach another Christ than the true Christ. For the true Christ is He that
was foretold in the prophecies uttered by Moses himself, and by the other holy men of that
nation. Moses accordingly commanded that whoever tried to teach another Christ should
be put to death. In obedience to this command, the voice of the Catholic Church, as with
the spiritual two-edged sword of both Testaments, puts to death all who try to turn us away
from our God, or to break any of the commandments. And chief among these is Manichæus
himself; for the truth of the law and the prophets convinces him of error as trying to turn
us away from our God, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, whom Christ acknowledges,
and as trying to break the commandments of the law, which, even when they are
only figurative, we regard as prophetic of Christ.</p>
<p>26. Faustus uses an argument which is either very deceitful or very stupid. And as
Faustus is not stupid, it is probable that he used the argument intentionally, with the design
of misleading the careless reader. He says: If these things are not written of Christ, and if
you cannot show any others, it follows that there are none at all. The proposition is true;
but it remains to be proved, both that these things are not written of Christ, and that no
other can be shown. Faustus has not proved this; for we have shown both how these things
are to be understood of Christ, and that there are many other things which have no meaning
but as applied to Christ. So it does not follow, as Faustus says, that nothing was written by
Moses of Christ. Let us repeat Faustus’ argument: If these things are not written of Christ,
and if you cannot show any others, it follows that there are none at all. Perfectly so. But as
both these things and many others have been shown to be written of Christ, or with reference
to Christ, the true conclusion is that Faustus’ argument is worthless. In the passages quoted
by Faustus, he has tried, though without success, to show that they were not written of
Christ. But in order to draw the conclusion that there are none at all, he should first have
proved that no others can be shown. Instead of this, he takes for granted that the readers
of his book will be blind, or the hearers deaf, so that the omission will be overlooked, and
runs on thus: If there are none, Christ could not have asserted that there were any. And if
Christ did not make this assertion, it follows that this verse is spurious. Here is a man who
thinks so much of what he says himself, that he does not consider the possibility of another
person saying the opposite. Where is your wit? Is this all you could say for a bad cause?
But if the badness of the cause made you utter folly, the bad cause was your own choice.
To prove your antecedent false, we have only to show some other things written of Christ.
If there are some, it will not be true that there are none. And if there are some, Christ may
have asserted that there were. And if Christ may have asserted this, it follows that this verse
of the Gospel is not spurious. Coming back, then, to Faustus’ proposition, If you cannot
show any other, it follows that there are none at all, it requires to be proved that we cannot
show any other. We need only refer to what we showed before, as sufficient to prove the
truth of the text in the Gospel, in which Christ says, "If ye believed Moses, ye would also

<pb n="396"/>
believe me; for he wrote of me." And even though from dullness of mind we could find
nothing written of Christ by Moses, still, so strong is the evidence in support of the authority
of the Gospel, that it would be incumbent on us to believe that not only some things, but
everything written by Moses, refers to Christ; for He says not, He wrote also of me, but, He
wrote of me. The truth then is this, that even though there were doubts, which God forbid,
of the genuineness of this verse, the doubt would be removed by the number of testimonies
to Christ which we find in Moses; while, on the other hand, even if we could find none, we
should still be bound to believe that these are to be found, because no doubts can be admitted
regarding any verse in the Gospel.</p>
<p>27. As to your argument that the doctrine of Moses was unlike that of Christ, and that
therefore it was improbable that if they believed Moses, they would believe Christ too; and
that it would rather follow that their belief in one would imply of necessity opposition to
the other,—you could not have said this if you had turned your mind’s eye for a moment
to see men all the world over, when they are not blinded by a contentious spirit, learned
and unlearned, Greek and barbarian, wise and unwise, to whom the apostle called himself
a debtor,616 believing in both Christ and Moses. If it was improbable that the Jews would
believe both Christ and Moses, it is still more improbable that all the world would do so.
But as we see all nations believing both, and in a common and well-grounded faith holding
the agreement of the prophecy of the one with the gospel of the other, it was no impossible
thing to which this one nation was called, when Christ said to them, "If ye believed Moses,
ye would also believe me." Rather we should be amazed at the guilty obstinacy of the Jews,
who refused to do what we see the whole world has done.</p>
<p>28. Regarding the Sabbath and circumcision, and the distinction in foods, in which you
say the teaching of Moses differs from what Christians are taught by Christ, we have already
shown that, as the apostle says, "all those things were our examples."617 The difference is
not in the doctrine, but in the time. There was a time when it was proper that these things
should be figuratively predicted; and there is now a different time when it is proper that
they should be openly declared and fully accomplished. It is not surprising that the Jews,
who understood the Sabbath in a carnal sense, should oppose Christ, who began to open
up its spiritual meaning. Reply, if you can, to the apostle, who declares that the rest of the
Sabbath was a shadow of something future.618 If the Jews opposed Christ because they did
not understand what the true Sabbath is, there is no reason why you should oppose Him,
or refuse to learn what true innocence is. For on that occasion when Jesus appears especially
to set aside the Sabbath, when His disciples were hungry, and pulled the ears of corn through
<note type="footnote">616 Rom. i. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">617 1 Cor. x. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">618 Col. ii. 16, 17.</note>

<pb n="397"/>
which they were passing, and ate them, Jesus, in replying to the Jews, declared His disciples
to be innocent. "If you knew," He said "what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice,
you would not have condemned the innocent."619 They should rather have pitied the
wants of the disciples, for hunger forced them to do what they did. But pulling ears of corn,
which is innocence in the teaching of Christ, is murder in the teaching of Manichæus. Or
was it an act of charity in the apostles to pull the ears of corn, that they might in eating set
free the members of God, as in your foolish notions? Then it must be cruelty in you not to
do the same. Faustus’ reason for setting aside the Sabbath is because he knows that God’s
power is exercised without cessation, and without weariness. It is for those to say this, who
believe that all times are the production of an eternal act of God’s will. But you will find it
difficult to reconcile this with your doctrine, that the rebellion of the race of darkness broke
your god’s rest, which was also disturbed by a sudden attack of the enemy; or perhaps God
never had rest, as he foresaw this from eternity, and could not feel at ease in the prospect
of so dire a conflict, with such loss and disaster to his members.</p>
<p>29. Unless Christ had considered this Sabbath—which in your want of knowledge and
of piety you laugh at—one of the prophecies written of Himself, He would not have borne
such a testimony to it as He did. For when, as you say in praise of Christ, He suffered voluntarily,
and so could choose His own time for suffering and for resurrection, He brought
it about that His body rested from all its works on Sabbath in the tomb, and that His resurrection
on the third day, which we call the Lord’s day, the day after the Sabbath, and therefore
the eighth, proved the circumcision of the eighth day to be also prophetical of Him. For
what does circumcision mean, but the eradication of the mortality which comes from our
carnal generation? So the apostle says: "Putting off from Himself His flesh, He made a show
of principalities and powers, triumphing over them in Himself."620 The flesh here said to
be put off is that mortality of flesh on account of which the body is properly called flesh.
The flesh is the mortality, for in the immortality of the resurrection there will be no flesh;
as it is written, "Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God." You are accustomed
to argue from these words against our faith in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body,
which has already taken place in the Lord Himself. You keep out of view the following
words, in which the apostle explains his meaning. To show what he here means by flesh,
he adds, "Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption." For this body, which from its
mortality is properly called flesh, is changed in the resurrection, so as to be no longer corruptible
and mortal. This is the apostle’s statement, and not a supposition of ours, as his
next words prove. "Lo" he says, "I show you a mystery: we shall all rise again, but we shall
not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the last
<note type="footnote">619 Matt. xii. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">620 Col. ii. 15.</note>

<pb n="398"/>
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."621
To put on immortality, the body puts off mortality. This is the mystery of circumcision,
which by the law took place on the eighth day; and on the eighth day, the Lord’s day, the
day after the Sabbath, was fulfilled in its true meaning by the Lord. Hence it is said, "Putting
off His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers." For by means of this mortality
the hostile powers of hell ruled over us. Christ is said to have made a show or example of
these, because in Himself, our Head, He gave an example which will be fully realized in the
liberation of His whole body, the Church, from the power of the devil at the last resurrection.
This is our faith. And according to the prophetic declaration quoted by Paul, "The just shall
live by faith." This is our justification.622 Even Pagans believe that Christ died. But only
Christians believe that Christ rose again. "If thou confess with thy mouth," says the apostle,
"that Jesus is the Lord, and believest in thy heart that God raised Him from the dead, thou
shalt be saved."623 Again, because we are justified by faith in Christ’s resurrection, the
apostle says, "He died for our offenses, and rose again for our justification."624 And because
this resurrection by faith in which we are justified was prefigured by the circumcision of
the eighth day, the apostle says of Abraham, with whom the observance began, "He received
the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith."625 Circumcision, then, is one
of the prophecies of Christ, written by Moses, of whom Christ said, "He wrote of me." In
the words of the Lord, "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass
sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the
child of hell than yourselves,"626 it is not the circumcision of the proselyte which is meant,
but his imitation of the conduct of the scribes and Pharisees, which the Lord forbids His
disciples to imitate, when He says: "The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat: what they
say unto you, do; but do not after their works; for they say, and do not."627 These words of
the Lord teach us both the honor due to the teaching of Moses, in whose seat even bad men
were obliged to teach good things, and the reason of the proselyte becoming a child of hell,
which was not that he heard from the Pharisees the words of the law, but that he copied
their example. Such a circumcised proselyte might have been addressed in the words of
Paul: "Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law."628 His imitation of the Pharisees

in not keeping the law made him a child of hell. And he was twofold more than they,
probably because of his neglecting to fulfill what he voluntarily undertook, when, not being
born a Jew, he chose to become a Jew.</p>
<p>30. Your scoff is very inappropriate, when you say that Moses discusses like a glutton
what should be eaten, and commands some things to be freely used as clean, and other
things as unclean to be not even touched. A glutton makes no distinction, except in
choosing the sweetest food. Perhaps you wish to commend to the admiration of the uninitiated
the innocence of your abstemious habits, by appearing not to know, or to have forgotten,
that swine’s flesh tastes better than mutton. But as this too was written by Moses of
Christ in figurative prophecy, in which the flesh of animals signifies those who are to be
united to the body of Christ, which is the Church, or who are to be cast out, you are typified
by the unclean animals; for your disagreement with the Catholic faith shows that you do
not ruminate on the word of wisdom, and that you do not divide the hoof, in the sense of
making a correct distinction between the Old Testament and the New. But you show still
more audacity in adopting the erroneous opinions of your Adimantus.</p>
<p>31. You follow Adimantus in saying that Christ made no distinction in food, except in
entirely prohibiting the use of animal food to His disciples, while He allowed the laity to eat
anything that is eatable; and declared that they were not polluted by what enters into the
mouth, but that the unseemly things which come out of the mouth are the things which
defile a man. These words of yours are unseemly indeed, for they express notorious falsehood.
If Christ taught that the evil things which come out of the mouth are the only things
that defile a man, why should they not be the only things to defile His disciples, so as to
make it unnecessary that any food should be forbidden or unclean? Is it only the laity that
are not polluted by what goes into the mouth, but by what comes out of it? In that case,
they are better protected from impurity than the saints, who are polluted both by what goes
in and by what comes out. But as Christ, comparing Himself with John, who came neither
eating nor drinking, says that He came eating and drinking, I should like to know what He
ate and drank. When exposing the perversity which found fault with both, He says: "John
came neither eating nor drinking; and ye say, He hath a devil. The Son of man cometh
eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans
and sinners."629 We know what John ate and drank. For it is not said that he drank nothing,
but that he drank no wine or strong drink; so he must have drunk water. He did not live
without food, but his food was locusts and wild honey.630 When Christ says that John did
not eat or drink, He means that he did not use the food which the Jews used. And because
the Lord used this food, He is spoken of, in contrast with John, as eating and drinking. Will
<note type="footnote">629 Matt. xi. 18, 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">630 Matt. iii. 4.</note>

<pb n="400"/>
it be said that it was bread and vegetables which the Lord ate, and which John did not eat?
It would be strange if one was said not to eat, because he used locusts and honey, while the
other is said to eat simply because he used bread and vegetables. But whatever may be
thought of the eating, certainly no one could be called a wine-bibber unless he used wine.
Why then do you call wine unclean? It is not in order to subdue the body by abstinence
that you prohibit these things, but because they are unclean, for you say that they are the
poisonous filth of the race of darkness; whereas the apostle says, "To the pure all things are
pure."631 Christ, according to this doctrine, taught that all food was alike, but forbade His
disciples to use what the Manichæans call unclean. Where do you find this prohibition?
You are not afraid to deceive men by falsehood; but in God’s righteous providence, you are
so blinded that you provide us with the means of refuting you. For I cannot resist quoting
for examination the whole of that passage of the Gospel which Faustus uses against Moses;
that we may see from it the falsehood of what was said first by Adimantus, and here by
Faustus, that the Lord Jesus forbade the use of animal food to His disciples, and allowed it
to the laity. After Christ’s reply to the accusation that His disciples ate with unwashen hands,
we read in the Gospel as follows: "And He called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear
and understand. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but that which cometh
out of the mouth, this defileth a man. Then came His disciples, and said unto Him, Knowest
Thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?" Here, when addressed
by His disciples, He ought certainly, according to the Manichæans, to have given them
special instructions to abstain from animal food, and to show that His words, "Not that
which goeth into the mouth defileth a man, but that which goeth out of the mouth," applied
to the multitude only. Let us hear, then, what, according to the evangelist, the Lord replied,
not to the multitude, but to His disciples: "But He answered and said, Every plant which
my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind
leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch." The
reason of this was, that in their desire to observe their own traditions, they did not understand
the commandments of God. As yet the disciples had not asked the Master how they were
to understand what He had said to the multitude. But now they do so; for the evangelist
adds: "Then answered Peter and said unto Him, Declare unto us this parable." This shows
that Peter thought that when the Lord said, "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth
a man, but that which goeth out of the mouth," He did not speak plainly and literally, but,
as usual, wished to convey some instruction under the guise of a parable. When His disciples,
then, put this question in private, does He tell them, as the Manichæans say, that all animal
food is unclean, and that they must never touch it? Instead of this, He rebukes them for
not understanding His plain language, and for thinking it a parable when it was not. We
<note type="footnote">631 Tit. i. 15.</note>

<pb n="401"/>
read: "And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? Do not ye yet understand,
that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the
drought? But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and
they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
thefts, false witness, blasphemies. These are the things which defile a man: but to
eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man."632</p>
<p>32. Here we have a complete exposure of the falsehood of the Manichæans: for it is
plain that the Lord did not in this matter teach one thing to the multitude, and another in
private to His disciples. Here is abundant evidence that the error and deceit are in the
Manichæans, and not in Moses, nor in Christ, nor in the doctrine taught figuratively in one
Testament and plainly in the other,—prophesied in one, and fulfilled in the other. How
can the Manichæans say that the Catholics regard none of the things that Moses wrote,
when in fact they observe them all, not now in the figures, but in what the figures were intended
to foretell? No one would say that one who reads the Scripture subsequently to its
being written does not observe it because he does not form the letters which he reads. The
letters are the figures of the sounds which he utters; and though he does not form the letters,
he cannot read without examining them. The reason why the Jews did not believe in Christ,
was because they did not observe even the plain literal precepts of Moses. So Christ says to
them: "Ye pay tithe of mint and cummin, and omit the weightier matters of the law, mercy
and judgment. Ye strain out a gnat and swallow a camel. These ought ye to have done, and
not to leave the other undone."633 So also He told them that by their traditions they made
of none effect the commandment of God to give honor to parents. On account of this pride
and perversity in neglecting what they understood, they were justly blinded, so that they
could not understand the other things.</p>
<p>33. You see, my argument is not that if you are a Christian you must believe Christ
when He says that Moses wrote of Him, and that if you do not believe this you are no
Christian. The account you give of yourself in asking to be dealt with as a Jew or a Gentile
is your own affair. My endeavor is to leave no avenue of error open to you. I have shut you
out, too, from that precipice to which you rush as a last resort, when you say that these are
spurious passages in the Gospel; so that, freed from the pernicious influence of this opinion,
you may be reduced to the necessity of believing in Christ. You say you wish to be taught
like the Christian Thomas, whom Christ did not spurn from Him because he doubted of
Him, but, in order to heal the wounds of his mind, showed him the marks of the wounds
in His own body. These are your own words. It is well that you desire to be taught as
Thomas was. I feared you would make out this passage too to be spurious. Believe, then,
<note type="footnote">632 Matt. xv. 16-20.</note>
<note type="footnote">633 Matt. xxiii. 23, 24.</note>

<pb n="402"/>
the marks of Christ’s wounds. For if the marks were real, the wounds must have been real.
And the wounds could not have been real, unless His body had been capable of real wounds;
which upsets at once the whole error of the Manichæans. If you say that the marks were
unreal which Christ showed to His doubting disciple, it follows that He must be a deceitful
teacher, and that you wish to be deceived in being taught by Him. But as no one wishes to
be deceived, while many wish to deceive, it is probable that you would rather imitate the
teaching which you ascribe to Christ than the learning you ascribe to Thomas. If, then, you
believe that Christ deceived a doubting inquirer by false marks of wounds, you must yourself
be regarded, not as a safe teacher, but as a dangerous impostor. On the other hand, if Thomas
touched the real marks of Christ’s wounds, you must confess that Christ had a real body.
So, if you believe as Thomas did, you are no more a Manichæan. If you do not believe even
with Thomas, you must be left to your infidelity.</p>

<p>Faustus rejects Christ’s declaration that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets but
to fulfill them, on the ground that it is found only in Matthew, who was not present when
the words purport to have been spoken. Augustin rebukes the folly of refusing to believe
Matthew and yet believing Manichæus, and shows what the passage of scripture really
means.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You ask why we do not receive the law and the prophets, when Christ
said that he came not to destroy them, but to fulfill them. Where do we learn that Jesus said
this? From Matthew, who declares that he said it on the mount. In whose presence was it
said? In the presence of Peter, Andrew, James, and John—only these four; for the rest, including
Matthew himself, were not yet chosen. Is it not the case that one of these four—John,
namely—wrote a Gospel? It is. Does he mention this saying of Jesus? No. How, then, does
it happen that what is not recorded by John, who was on the mount, is recorded by Matthew,
who became a follower of Christ long after He came down from the mount? In the first
place, then, we must doubt whether Jesus ever said these words, since the proper witness is
silent on the matter, and we have only the authority of a less trustworthy witness. But, besides
this, we shall find that it is not Matthew that has imposed upon us, but some one else under
his name, as is evident from the indirect style of the narrative. Thus we read: "As Jesus
passed by, He saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom, and called him;
and he immediately rose up, and followed Him."634 No one writing of himself would say,
He saw a man, and called him; and he followed Him; but, He saw me, and called me, and I
followed Him. Evidently this was written not by Matthew himself, but by some one else
under his name. Since, then, the passage already quoted would not be true even if it had
been written by Matthew, since he was not present when Jesus spoke on the mount; much
more is its falsehood evident from the fact that the writer was not Matthew himself, but
some one borrowing the names both of Jesus and of Matthew.</p>
<p>2. The passage itself, in which Christ tells the Jews not to think that He came to destroy
the law, is rather designed to show that He did destroy it. For, had He not done something
of the kind, the Jews would not have suspected Him. His words are: "Think not that I am
come to destroy the law." Suppose the Jews had replied, What actions of thine might lead
us to suspect this? Is it because thou exposest circumcision, breakest the Sabbath, discardest
sacrifices, makest no distinction in foods? this would be the natural answer to the words,
Think not. The Jews had the best possible reason for thinking that Jesus destroyed the law.
If this was not to destroy the law, what is? But, indeed, the law and the prophets consider
themselves already so faultlessly perfect, that they have no desire to be fulfilled. Their author

and father condemns adding to them as much as taking away anything from them; as we
read in Deuteronomy: "These precepts which I deliver unto thee this day, O Israel, thou
shalt observe to do; thou shalt not turn aside from them to the right hand or to the left; thou
shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it, that thy God may bless thee."635 Whether,
therefore, Jesus turned aside to the right by adding to the law and the prophets in order to
fulfill them, or to the left in taking away from them to destroy them, either way he offended
the author of the law. So this verse must either have some other meaning, or be spurious.</p>
<p>3. Augustin replied: What amazing folly, to disbelieve what Matthew records of Christ,
while you believe Manichæus! If Matthew is not to be believed because he was not present
when Christ said, "I came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill," was
Manichæus present, was he even born, when Christ appeared among men? According,
then, to your rule, you should not believe anything that Manichæus says of Christ. On the
other hand, we refuse to believe what Manichæus says of Christ; not because he was not
present as a witness of Christ’s words and actions, but because he contradicts Christ’s disciples,
and the Gospel which rests on their authority. The apostle, speaking in the Holy
Spirit, tells us that such teachers would arise. With reference to such, he says to believers:
"If any man preaches to you another gospel than that ye have received, let him be accursed."
636 If no one can say what is true of Christ unless he has himself seen and heard
Him, no one now can be trusted. But if believers can now say what is true of Christ because
the truth has been handed down in word or writing by those who saw and heard, why might
not Matthew have heard the truth from his fellow-disciple John, if John was present and he
himself was not, as from the writings of John both we who are born so long after and those
who shall be born after us can learn the truth about Christ? In this way, the Gospels of Luke
and Mark, who were companions of the disciples, as well as the Gospel of Matthew, have
the same authority as that of John. Besides, the Lord Himself might have told Matthew
what those called before him had already been witnesses of. Your idea is, that John should
have recorded this saying of the Lord, as he was present on the occasion. As if it might not
happen that, since it was impossible to write all that be heard from the Lord, he set himself
to write some, omitting this among others. Does he not say at the close of his Gospel: "And
there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every
one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written"?
637 This proves that he omitted many things intentionally. But if you choose John as
an authority regarding the law and the prophets, I ask you only to believe his testimony to
them. It is John who writes that Isaiah saw the glory of Christ.638 It is in his Gospel we find

the text already treated of: "If ye believed Moses, ye would also believe me; for he wrote of
me."639 Your evasions are met on every side. You ought to say plainly that you do not believe
the gospel of Christ. For to believe what you please, and not to believe what you please, is
to believe yourselves, and not the gospel.</p>
<p>4. Faustus thinks himself wonderfully clever in proving that Matthew was not the writer
of this Gospel, because, when speaking of his own election, he says not, He saw me, and said
to me, Follow me; but, He saw him, and said to him, Follow me. This must have been said
either in ignorance or from a design to mislead. Faustus can hardly be so ignorant as not
to have read or heard that narrators, when speaking of themselves, often use a construction
as if speaking of another. It is more probable that Faustus wished to bewilder those more
ignorant than himself, in the hope of getting hold on not a few unacquainted with these
things. It is needless to resort to other writings to quote examples of this construction from
profane authors for the information of our friends, and for the refutation of Faustus. We
find examples in passages quoted above from Moses by Faustus himself, without any denial,
or rather with the assertion, that they were written by Moses, only not written of Christ.
When Moses, then, writes of himself, does he say, I said this, or I did that, and not rather,
Moses said, and Moses did? Or does he say, The Lord called me, The Lord said to me, and
not rather, The Lord called Moses, The Lord said to Moses, and so on? So Matthew, too,
speaks of himself in the third person. And John does the same; for towards the end of his
book he says: "Peter, turning, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, who also lay on His breast
at supper, and who said to the Lord, Who is it that shall betray Thee?" Does he say, Peter,
turning, saw me? Or will you argue from this that John did not write this Gospel? But he
adds a little after: "This is the disciple that testifies of Jesus, and has written these things;
and we know that his testimony is true."640 Does he say, I am the disciple who testify of
Jesus, and who have written these things, and we know that my testimony is true? Evidently
this style is common in writers of narratives. There are innumerable instances in which the
Lord Himself uses it. "When the Son of man," He says, "cometh, shall He find faith on the
earth?"641 Not, When I come, shall I find? Again, "The Son of man came eating and
drinking;"642 not, I came. Again, "The hour shall come, and now is, when the dead shall
hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live;"643 not, My voice. And so in
many other places. This may suffice to satisfy inquirers and to refute scoffers.</p>

<p>5. Every one can see the weakness of the argument that Christ could not have said,
"Think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets: I came not to destroy, but
to fulfill," unless He had done something to create a suspicion of this kind. Of course, we
grant that the unenlightened Jews may have looked upon Christ as the destroyer of the law
and the prophets; but their very suspicion makes it certain that the true and truthful One,
in saying that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, referred to no other law
than that of the Jews. This is proved by the words that follow: "Verily, verily, I say unto
you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till
all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments,
and shall teach men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whosoever
shall do and teach them, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." This applied to
the Pharisees, who taught the law in word, while they broke it in deed. Christ says of the
Pharisees in another place, "What they say, that do; but do not after their works: for they
say, and do not."644 So here also He adds, "For I say unto you, Except your righteousness
exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven;"645 that is, Unless ye shall both do and teach what they teach without doing, ye
shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. This law, therefore, which the Pharisees taught
without keeping it, Christ says He came not to destroy, but to fulfill; for this was the law
connected with the seat of Moses in which the Pharisees sat, who because they said without
doing, are to be heard, but not to be imitated.</p>
<p>6. Faustus does not understand, or pretends not to understand, what it is to fulfill the
law. He supposes the expression to mean the addition of words to the law, regarding which
it is written that nothing is to be added to or taken away from the Scriptures of God. From
this Faustus argues that there can be no fulfillment of what is spoken of as so perfect that
nothing can be added to it or taken from it. Faustus requires to be told that the law is fulfilled
by living as it enjoins. "Love is the fulfilling of the law,"646 as the apostle says. The Lord
has vouchsafed both to manifest and to impart this love, by sending the Holy Spirit to His
believing people. So it is said by the same apostle: "The love of God is shed abroad in our
heart by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us."647 And the Lord Himself says: "By this
shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."648 The law,
then, is fulfilled both by the observance of its precepts and by the accomplishment of its
prophecies. For "the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."649

The law itself, by being fulfilled, becomes grace and truth. Grace is the fulfillment of love,
and truth is the accomplishment of the prophecies. And as both grace and truth are by
Christ, it follows that He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it; not by supplying any
defects in the law, but by obedience to what is written in the law. Christ’s own words declare
this. For He does not say, One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till its defects
are supplied, but "till all be fulfilled."</p>

<p>The relation of Christ to prophecy, continued.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: "I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it." If these are Christ’s
words, unless they have some other meaning, they are as much against you as against me.
Your Christianity as well as mine is based on the belief that Christ came to destroy the law
and the prophets. Your actions prove this, even though in words you deny it. It is on this
ground that you disregard the precepts of the law and the prophets. It is on this ground
that we both acknowledge Jesus as the founder of the New Testament, in which is implied
the acknowledgment that the Old Testament is destroyed. How, then, can we believe that
Christ said these words without first confessing that hitherto we have been wholly in error,
and without showing our repentance by entering on a course of obedience to the law and
the prophets, and of careful observance of their requirements, whatever they may be? This
done, we may honestly believe that Jesus said that he came not to destroy the law, but to
fulfill it. As it is, you accuse me of not believing what you do not believe yourself, and what
therefore is false.</p>
<p>2. But grant that we have been in the wrong hitherto. What is to be done now? Shall
we come under the law, since Christ has not destroyed, but fulfilled it? Shall we by circumcision
add shame to shame, and believe that God is pleased with such sacraments? Shall we
observe the rest of the Sabbath, and bind ourselves in the fetters of Saturn? Shall we glut
the demon of the Jews, for he is not God, with the slaughter of bulls, rams, and goats, not
to say of men; and adopt, only with greater cruelty, in obedience to the law and the prophets,
the practices on account of which we abandoned idolatry? Shall we, in fine, call the flesh
of some animals clean, and that of others unclean, among which, according to the law and
the prophets, swine’s flesh has a particular defilement? Of course you will allow that as
Christians we must not do any of these things, for you remember that Christ says that a
man when circumcised becomes twofold a child of hell. 650 It is plain also that Christ neither
observed the Sabbath himself, nor commanded it to be observed. And regarding foods, he
says expressly that man is not defiled by anything that goes into his mouth, but rather by
the things which come out of it.651 Regarding sacrifices, too, he often says that God desires
mercy, and not sacrifice.652 What becomes, then, of the statement that he came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfill it? If Christ said this, he must have meant something else, or,
what is not to be thought of, he told a lie, or he never said it. No Christian will allow that

<pb n="409"/>
Jesus spoke falsely; therefore he must either not have said this, or said it with another
meaning.</p>
<p>3. For my part, as a Manichæan, this verse has little difficulty for me, for at the outset
I am taught to believe that many things which pass in Scripture under the name of the Saviour
are spurious, and that they must therefore be tested to find whether they are true, and sound,
and genuine; for the enemy who comes by night has corrupted almost every passage by
sowing tares among the wheat. So I am not alarmed by these words, notwithstanding the
sacred name affixed to them; for I still claim the liberty to examine whether this comes from
the hand of the good sower, who sows in the day-time, or of the evil one, who sows in the
night. But what escape from this difficulty can there be for you, who receive everything
without examination, condemning the use of reason, which is the prerogative of human
nature, and thinking it impiety to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and as much
afraid of separating between what is good and what is not as children are of ghosts? For
suppose a Jew or any one acquainted with these words should ask you why you do not keep
the precepts of the law and the prophets, since Christ says that he came not to destroy but
to fulfill them: you will be obliged either to join in the superstitious follies of the Jews, or
to declare this verse false, or to deny that you are a follower of Christ.</p>
<p>4. Augustin replied: Since you continue repeating what has been so often exposed and
refuted, we must be content to repeat the refutation. The things in the law and the prophets
which Christians do not observe, are only the types of what they do observe. These types
were figures of things to come, and are necessarily removed when the things themselves are
fully revealed by Christ, that in this very removal the law and the prophets may be fulfilled.
So it is written in the prophets that God would give a new covenant, "not as I gave to their
fathers."653 Such was the hardness of heart of the people under the Old Testament, that
many precepts were given to them, not so much because they were good, as because they
suited the people. Still, in all these things the future was foretold and prefigured, although
the people did not understand the meaning of their own observances. After the manifest
appearance of the things thus signified, we are not required to observe the types; but we
read them to see their meaning. So, again, it is foretold in the prophets, "I will take away
their stony heart, and will give them a heart of flesh,"654—that is, a sensible heart, instead
of an insensible one. To this the apostle alludes in the words: "Not in tables of stone, but
in the fleshy tables of the heart."655 The fleshy tables of the heart are the same as the heart
of flesh. Since, then, the removal of these observances is foretold, the law and the prophets
could not have been fulfilled but by this removal. Now, however, the prediction is accom-

plished, and the fulfillment of the law and the prophets is found in what at first sight seems
the very opposite.</p>
<p>5. We are not afraid to meet your scoff at the Sabbath, when you call it the fetters of
Saturn. It is a silly and unmeaning expression, which occurred to you only because you are
in the habit of worshipping the sun on what you call Sunday. What you call Sunday we call
the Lord’s day, and on it we do not worship the sun, but the Lord’s resurrection. And in
the same way, the fathers observed the rest of the Sabbath, not because they worshipped
Saturn, but because it was incumbent at that time, for it was a shadow of things to come, as
the apostle testifies.656 The Gentiles, of whom the apostle says that they "worshipped and
served the creature rather than the Creator,"657 gave the names of their gods to the days of
the week. And so far you do the same, except that you worship only the two brightest luminaries,
and not the rest of the stars, as the Gentiles did. Besides, the Gentiles gave the
names of their gods to the months. In honor of Romulus, whom they believed to be the son
of Mars, they dedicated the first month to Mars, and called it March. The next month, April,
is named not from any god, but from the word for opening, because the buds generally open
in this month. The third month is called May, in honor of Maia the mother of Mercury.
The fourth is called June, from Juno. The rest to December used to be named according to
their number. The fifth and sixth, however, got the names of July and August from men to
whom divine honors were decreed; while the others, from September to December, continued
to be named from their number. January, again, is named from Janus, and February from
the rites of the Luperci called Februæ. Must we say that you worship the god Mars in the
month of March? But that is the month in which you hold the feast you call Bema with
great pomp. But if you think it allowable to observe the month of March without thinking
of Mars, why do you try to bring in the name of Saturn in connection with the rest of the
seventh day enjoined in Scripture, merely because the Gentiles call the day Saturday? The
Scripture name for the day is Sabbath, which means rest. Your scoff is as unreasonable as
it is profane.</p>
<p>6. As regards animal sacrifices, every Christian knows that they were enjoined as suitable
to a perverse people, and not because God had any pleasure in them. Still, even in these
sacrifices there were types of what we enjoy; for we cannot obtain purification or the propitiation
of God without blood. The fulfillment of these types is in Christ, by whose blood
we are purified and redeemed. In these figures of the divine oracles, the bull represents
Christ, because with the horns of His cross He scatters the wicked; the lamb, from His
matchless innocence; the goat, from His being made in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by
sin He might condemn sin.658 Whatever kind of sacrifice you choose to specify, I will show

you a prophecy of Christ in it. Thus we have shown regarding circumcision, and the Sabbath,
and the distinction of food, and the sacrifice of animals, that all these things were our examples,
and our prophecies, which Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill, by fulfilling
what was thus foretold. Your opponent is the apostle, whose opinion I give in his own
words: "All these things were our examples." 659</p>
<p>7. If you have learned from Manichæus the willful impiety of admitting only those parts
of the Gospel which do not contradict your errors, while you reject the rest, we have learned
from the apostle the pious caution of looking on every one as accursed that preaches to us
another gospel than that which we have received. Hence Catholic Christians look upon you
as among the tares; for, in the Lord’s exposition of the meaning of the tares, they are not
falsehood mixed with truth in the Scriptures, but children of the wicked one—that is, people
who imitate the deceitfulness of the devil. It is not true that Catholic Christians believe
everything; for they do not believe Manichæus or any of the heretics. Nor do they condemn
the use of human reason; but what you call reasoning they prove to be fallacious. Nor do
they think it profane to distinguish truth from falsehood; for they distinguish between the
truth of the Catholic faith and the falsehood of your doctrines. Nor do they fear to separate
good from evil; but they contend that evil, instead of being natural, is unnatural. They know
nothing of your race of darkness, which, you say, is produced from a principle of its own,
and fights against the kingdom of God, and of which your god seems really to be more
frightened than children are of ghosts; for, according to you, he covered himself with a veil,
that he might not see his own members taken and plundered by the assault of the enemy.
To conclude, Catholic Christians are in no difficulty regarding the words of Christ, though
in one sense they may be said not to observe the law and the prophets; for by the grace of
Christ they keep the law by their love to God and man; and on these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets.660 Besides, they see in Christ and the Church the fulfillment
of all the prophecies of the Old Testament, whether in the form of actions, or of symbolic
rites, or of figurative language. So we neither join in superstitious follies, nor declare
this verse false; nor deny that we are followers of Christ; for on those principles which I have
set forth to the best of my power, the law and the prophets which Christ came not to destroy,
but to fulfill, are no other than those recognized by the Church.</p>

<p>Faustus is willing to admit that Christ may have said that He came not to destroy the law and
the prophets, but to fulfill them; but if He did, it was to pacify the Jews and in a modified
sense. Augustin replies, and still further elaborates the Catholic view of prophecy and its
fulfillment.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: I will grant that Christ said that he came not to destroy the law and the
prophets, but to fulfill them. But why did Jesus say this? Was it to pacify the Jews, who
were enraged at seeing their sacred institutions trampled upon by Christ, and regarded him
as a wild blasphemer, not to be listened to, much less to be followed? Or was it for our instruction
as Gentile believers, that we might learn meekly and patiently to bear the yoke of
commandment laid on our necks by the law and the prophets of the Jews? You yourself
can hardly suppose that Christ’s words were intended to bring us under the authority of the
law and the prophets of the Hebrews. So that the other explanation which I have given of
the words must be the true one. Every one knows that the Jews were always ready to attack
Christ, both with words and with actual violence. Naturally, then, they would be enraged
at the idea that Christ was destroying their law and their prophets; and, to appease them,
Christ might very well tell them not to think that he came to destroy the law, but that he
came to fulfill it. There was no falsehood or deceit in this, for he used the word law in a
general sense, not of any particular law.</p>
<p>2. There are three laws. One is that of the Hebrews, which the apostle calls the law of
sin and death.661 The second is that of the Gentiles, which he calls the law of nature. "For
the Gentiles," he says, "do by nature the things contained in the law; and, not having the
law, they are a law into themselves; who show the work of the law written on their hearts."662
The third law is the truth of which the apostle speaks when he says, "The law of the spirit
of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."663 Since, then,
there are three laws, we must carefully inquire which of the three Christ spoke of when He
said that He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. In the same way, there are prophets
of the Jews, and prophets of the Gentiles, and prophets of truth. With the prophets of the
Jews, of course, every one is acquainted. If any one is in doubt about the prophets of the
Gentiles, let him hear what Paul says when writing of the Cretans to Titus: "A prophet of
their own has said, The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."664 This proves
that the Gentiles also had their prophets. The truth also has its prophets, as we learn from

Jesus as well as from Paul. Jesus says: "Behold, I send unto you wise men and prophets, and
some of them ye shall kill in divers places."665 And Paul says: "The Lord Himself appointed
first apostles, and then prophets."666</p>
<p>3. As "the law and the prophets" may have three different meanings, it is uncertain in
what sense the words are used by Jesus, though we may form a conjecture from what follows.
For if Jesus had gone on to speak of circumcision, and Sabbaths, and sacrifices, and the observances
of the Hebrews, and had added something as a fulfillment, there could have been
no doubt that it was the law and the prophets of the Jews of which He said that He came
not to destroy, but to fulfill them. But Christ, without any allusion to these, speaks only of
commandments which date from the earliest times: "Thou shall not kill; Thou shalt not
commit adultery; Thou shalt not bear false witness." These, it can be proved, were of old
promulgated in the world by Enoch and Seth, and the other righteous men, to whom the
precepts were delivered by angels of lofty rank, in order to tame the savage nature of men.
From this it appears that Jesus spoke of the law and the prophets of truth. And so we find
him giving a fulfillment of those precepts already quoted. "Ye have heard," He says, "that
it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; but I say unto you, Be not even angry."
This is the fulfillment. Again: "Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit
adultery; but I say unto you, Do not lust even." This is the fulfillment. Again: "It has been
said, Thou shalt not bear false witness; but I say unto you, Swear not." This too is the fulfillment.
He thus both confirms the old precepts and supplies their defects. Where He seems
to speak of some Jewish precepts, instead of fulfilling them, He substitutes for them precepts
of an opposite tendency. He proceeds thus: "Ye have heard that it has been said, An eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, Whosoever shall smite thee on thy
right cheek, turn to him the other also." This is not fulfillment, but destruction. Again: "It
has been said, Thou shall love thy friend, and hate thine enemy; but I say unto you, Love
your enemies, and pray for your persecutors." This too is destruction. Again: "It has been
said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement; but I say
unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth
her to commit adultery, and is himself an adulterer if he afterwards marries another woman."
667 These precepts are evidently destroyed because they are the precepts of Moses;
while the others are fulfilled because they are the precepts of the righteous men of antiquity.
If you agree to this explanation, we may allow that Jesus said that he came not to destroy
the law, but to fulfill it. If you disapprove of this explanation, give one of your own. Only

beware of making Jesus a liar, and of making yourself a Jew, by binding yourself to fulfill
the law because Christ did not destroy it.</p>
<p>4. If one of the Nazareans, or Symmachians, as they are sometimes called, were arguing
with me from these words of Jesus that he came not to destroy the law, I should find some
difficulty in answering him. For it is undeniable that, at his coming, Jesus was both in body
and mind subject to the influence of the law and the prophets. Those people, moreover,
whom I allude to, practise circumcision, and keep the Sabbath, and abstain from swine’s
flesh and such like things, according to the law, although they profess to be Christians. They
are evidently misled as well as you, by this verse in which Christ says that he came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfill it. It would not be easy to reply to such opponents without
first getting rid of this troublesome verse. But with you I have no difficulty, for you have
nothing to go upon; and instead of using arguments, you seem disposed, in mere mischief,
to induce me to believe that Christ said what you evidently do not yourself believe him to
have said. On the strength of this verse you accuse me of dullness and evasiveness, without
yourself giving any indication of keeping the law instead of destroying it. Do you too, like
a Jew or a Nazarean, glory in the obscene distinction of being circumcised? Do you pride
yourself in the observance of the Sabbath? Can you congratulate yourself on being innocent
of swine’s flesh? Or can you boast of having gratified the appetite of the Deity by the blood
of sacrifices and the incense of Jewish offerings? If not, why do you contend that Christ
came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it?</p>
<p>5. I give unceasing thanks to my teacher, who prevented me from falling into this error,
so that I am still a Christian. For I, like you, from reading this verse without sufficient
consideration, had almost resolved to become a Jew. And with reason; for if Christ came
not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, and as a vessel in order to be filled full must not be
empty, but partly filled already, I concluded that no one could become a Christian but an
Israelite, nearly filled already with the law and the prophets, and coming to Christ to be
filled to the full extent of his capacity. I concluded, too, that in thus coming he must not
destroy what he already possesses; otherwise it would be a case, not of fulfilling, but of
emptying. Then it appeared that I, as a Gentile, could get nothing by coming to Christ, for
I brought nothing that he could fill up by his additions. This preparatory supply is found,
on inquiry, to consist of Sabbaths, circumcision, sacrifices, new moons, baptisms, feasts of
unleavened bread, distinctions of foods, drink, and clothes, and other things, too many to
specify. This, then, it appeared, was what Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. Naturally
it must appear so: for what is a law without precepts, or prophets without predictions?
Besides, there is that terrible curse pronounced upon those who abide not in all things that
are written in the book of the law to do them. 668 With the fear of this curse appearing to

<pb n="415"/>
come from God on the one side, and with Christ on the other side, seeming, as the Son of
God, to say that he came not to destroy these things, but to fulfill them, what was to prevent
me from becoming a Jew? The wise instruction of Manichæus saved me from this danger.</p>
<p>6. But how can you venture to quote this verse against me? Or why should it be against
me only, when it is as much against yourself? If Christ does not destroy the law and the
prophets, neither must Christians do so. Why then do you destroy them? Do you begin to
perceive that you are no Christian? How can you profane with all kinds of work the day
pronounced sacred in the law and in all the prophets, on which they say that God, the maker
of the world, himself rested, without dreading the penalty of death pronounced against
Sabbath-breakers, or the curse on the transgressor? How can you refuse to receive in your
person the unseemly mark of circumcision, which the law and all the prophets declare to
be honorable, especially in the case of Abraham, after what was thought to be his faith; for
does not the God of the Jews proclaim that whosoever is without this mark of infamy shall
perish from his people? How can you neglect the appointed sacrifices, which were made
so much of both by Moses and the prophets under the law, and by Abraham in his faith?
And how can you defile your souls by making no distinction in foods, if you believe that
Christ came not to destroy these things, but to fulfill them? Why do you discard the annual
feast of unleavened bread, and the appointed sacrifice of the lamb, which, according to the
law and the prophets, is to be observed for ever? Why, in a word, do you treat so lightly the
new moons, the baptisms, and the feast of tabernacles, and all the other carnal ordinances
of the law and the prophets, if Christ did not destroy them? I have therefore good reason
for saying that, in order to justify your neglect of these things, you must either abandon
your profession of being Christ’s disciple, or acknowledge that Christ himself has already
destroyed them; and from this acknowledgment it must follow, either that this text is
spurious in which Christ is made to say that he came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it,
or that the words have an entirely different meaning from what you suppose.</p>
<p>7. Augustin replied: If you allow, in consideration of the authority of the Gospel, that
Christ said that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, you
should show the same consideration to the authority of the apostle, when he says, "All these
things were our examples;" and again of Christ, "He was not yea and nay, but in Him was
yea; for all the promises of God are in Him yea;"669 that is, they are set forth and fulfilled in
Him. In this way you will see in the clearest light both what law Christ fulfilled, and how
He fulfilled it. It is a vain attempt that you make to escape by your three kinds of law and
your three kinds of prophets. It is quite plain, and the New Testament leaves no doubt on
the matter, what law and what prophets Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. The law
given by Moses is that which by Jesus Christ became grace and truth.670 The law given by
<note type="footnote">669 2 Cor. i. 19, 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">670 John i. 17.</note>

<pb n="416"/>
Moses is that of which Christ says, "He wrote of me."671 For undoubtedly this is the law
which entered that the offence might abound;672 words which you often ignorantly quote
as a reproach to the law. Read what is there said of this law: "The law is holy, and the
commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto
me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is
good."673 The entrance of the law made the offense abound, not because the law required
what was wrong, but because the proud and self-confident incurred additional guilt as
transgressors after their acquaintance with the holy, and just, and good commandments of
the law; so that, being thus humbled, they might learn that only by grace through faith could
they be freed from subjection to the law as transgressors, and be reconciled to the law as
righteous. So the same apostle says: "For before faith came, we were kept under the law,
shut up unto the faith which was afterwards revealed. Therefore the law was our schoolmaster
in Christ Jesus; but after faith came, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."674 That is, we
are no longer subject to the penalty of the law, because we are set free by grace. Before we
received in humility the grace of the Spirit, the letter was only death to us, for it required
obedience which we could not render. Thus Paul also says: "The letter killeth, but the
spirit giveth life."675 Again, he says: "For if a law had been given which could have given
life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all
under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."676
And once more: "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh,
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but
after the Spirit."677 Here we see Christ coming not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. As
the law brought the proud under the guilt of transgression, increasing their sin by commandments
which they could not obey, so the righteousness of the same law is fulfilled by the
grace of the Spirit in those who learn from Christ to be meek and lowly in heart; for Christ
came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. Moreover, because even for those who are under
grace it is difficult in this mortal life perfectly to keep what is written in the law, Thou shall
not covet, Christ, by the sacrifice of His flesh, as our Priest obtains pardon for us. And in
this also He fulfills the law; for what we fail in through weakness is supplied by His perfection,

who is the Head, while we are His members. Thus John says: "My little children, these
things write I unto you, that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: He is the propitiation for our sins."678</p>
<p>8. Christ also fulfilled the prophecies, because the promises of God were made good in
Him. As the apostle says in the verse quoted above, "The promises of God are in Him yea."
Again, he says: "Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth
of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers."679 Whatever, then, was promised
in the prophets, whether expressly or in figure, whether by words or by actions, was fulfilled
in Him who came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them. You do not
perceive that if Christians were to continue in the use of acts and observances by which
things to come were prefigured, the only meaning would be that the things prefigured had
not yet come. Either the thing prefigured has not come, or if it has, the figure becomes superfluous
or misleading. Therefore, if Christians do not practise some things enjoined in
the Hebrews by the prophets, this, so far from showing, as you think, that Christ did not
fulfill the prophets, rather shows that He did. So completely did Christ fulfill what these
types prefigured, that it is no longer prefigured. So the Lord Himself says: "The law and
the prophets were until John."680 For the law which shut up transgressors in increased guilt,
and to the faith which was afterwards revealed, became grace through Jesus Christ, by whom
grace superabounded. Thus the law, which was not fulfilled in the requirement of the letter,
was fulfilled in the liberty of grace. In the same way, everything in the law that was prophetic
of the Saviour’s advent, whether in words or in typical actions, became truth in Jesus
Christ. For "the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."681 At
Christ’s advent the kingdom of God began to be preached; for the law and the prophets
were until John: the law, that its transgressors might desire salvation; the prophets, that
they might foretell the Saviour. No doubt there have been prophets in the Church since the
ascension of Christ. Of these prophets Paul says: "God hath set some in the Church, first
apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers," and so on.682 It is not of these prophets
that it was said, "The law and the prophets were until John," but of those who prophesied
the first coming of Christ, which evidently cannot be prophesied now that it has taken place.</p>
<p>9. Accordingly, when you ask why a Christian is not circumcised if Christ came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfill it, my reply is, that a Christian is not circumcised precisely for
this reason, that what was prefigured by circumcision is fulfilled in Christ. Circumcision

was the type of the removal of our fleshly nature, which was fulfilled in the resurrection of
Christ, and which the sacrament of baptism teaches us to look forward to in our own resur-
rection. The sacrament of the new life is not wholly discontinued, for our resurrection from
the dead is still to come; but this sacrament has been improved by the substitution of baptism
for circumcision, because now a pattern of the eternal life which is to come is afforded us
in the resurrection of Christ, whereas formerly there was nothing of the kind. So, when you
ask why a Christian does not keep the Sabbath, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to
fulfill it, my reply is, that a Christian does not keep the Sabbath precisely because what was
prefigured in the Sabbath is fulfilled in Christ. For we have our Sabbath in Him who said,
"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto
your souls."683</p>
<p>10. When you ask why a Christian does not observe the distinction in food as enjoined
in the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that a Christian does
not observe this distinction precisely because what was thus prefigured is now fulfilled in
Christ, who admits into His body, which in His saints He has predestined to eternal life,
nothing which in human conduct corresponds to the characteristics of the forbidden animals.
When you ask, again, why a Christian does not offer sacrifices to God of the flesh and blood
of slain animals, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that it would
be improper for a Christian to offer such sacrifices, now that what was thus prefigured has
been fulfilled in Christ’s offering of His own body and blood. When you ask why a Christian
does not keep the feast of unleavened bread as the Jews did, if Christ came not to destroy
the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that a Christian does not keep this feast precisely because
what was thus prefigured is fulfilled in Christ, who leads us to a new life by purging out the
leaven of the old life.684 When you ask why a Christian does not keep the feast of the paschal
lamb, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, my reply is, that he does not keep
it precisely because what was thus prefigured has been fulfilled in the sufferings of Christ,
the Lamb without spot. When you ask why a Christian does not keep the feasts of the new
moon appointed in the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply,
that he does not keep them precisely because what was thus prefigured is fulfilled in Christ.
For the feast of the new moon prefigured the new creature, of which the apostle says: "If
therefore there is any new creature in Christ Jesus, the old things have passed away; behold,
all things are become new."685 When you ask why a Christian does not observe the baptisms
for various kinds of uncleanness according to the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law,
<note type="footnote">683 Matt. xi. 28, 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">684 1 Cor. v. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">685 2 Cor. v. 17.</note>

<pb n="419"/>
but to fulfill it, I reply, that he does not observe them precisely because they were figures of
things to come, which Christ has fulfilled. For He came to bury us with Himself by baptism
into death, that as Christ rose again from the dead, so we also should walk in newness of
life.686 When you ask why Christians do not keep the feast of tabernacles, if the law is not
destroyed, but fulfilled by Christ, I reply that believers are God’s tabernacle, in whom, as
they are united and built together in love, God condescends to dwell, so that Christians do
not keep this feast precisely because what was thus prefigured is now fulfilled by Christ in
His Church.</p>
<p>11. I touch upon these things merely in passing with the utmost brevity, rather than
omit them altogether. The subjects, taken separately, have filled many large volumes, written
to prove that these observances were typical of Christ. So it appears that all the things in
the Old Testament which you think are not observed by Christians because Christ destroyed
the law, are in fact not observed because Christ fulfilled the law. The very intention of the
observances was to prefigure Christ. Now that Christ has come, instead of its being strange
or absurd that what was done to prefigure His advent should not be done any more, it is
perfectly right and reasonable. The typical observances intended to prefigure the coming
of Christ would be observed still, had they not been fulfilled by the coming of Christ; so far
is it from being the case that our not observing them now is any proof of their not being
fulfilled by Christ’s coming. There can be no religious society, whether the religion be true
or false, without some sacrament or visible symbol to serve as a bond of union. The importance
of these sacraments cannot be overstated, and only scoffers will treat them lightly. For
if piety requires them, it must be impiety to neglect them.</p>
<p>12. It is true, the ungodly may partake in the visible sacraments of godliness, as we read
that Simon Magus received holy baptism. Such are they of whom the apostle says that "they
have the form of godliness, but deny the power of it."687 The power of godliness is the end
of the commandment, that is, love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of
faith unfeigned.688 So the Apostle Peter, speaking of the sacrament of the ark, in which the
family of Noah was saved from the deluge, says, "So by a similar figure baptism also saves
you." And lest they should rest content with the visible sacrament, by which they had the
form of godliness, and should deny its power in their lives by profligate conduct, he immediately
adds, "Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience."

<pb n="420"/>
<p>13. Thus the sacraments of the Old Testament, which were celebrated in obedience to
the law, were types of Christ who was to come; and when Christ fulfilled them by His advent
they were done away, and were done away because they were fulfilled. For Christ came not
to destroy, but to fulfill. And now that the righteousness of faith is revealed, and the children
of God are called into liberty, and the yoke of bondage which was required for a carnal and
stiffnecked people is taken away, other sacraments are instituted, greater in efficacy, more
beneficial in their use, easier in performance, and fewer in number.</p>
<p>14. And if the righteous men of old, who saw in the sacraments of their time the
promise of a future revelation of faith, which even then their piety enabled them to discern
in the dim light of prophecy, and by which they lived, for the just can live only by faith;690
if, then, these righteous men of old were ready to suffer, as many actually did suffer, all trials
and tortures for the sake of those typical sacraments which prefigured things in the future;
if we praise the three children and Daniel, because they refused to be defiled by meat from
the king’s table, from their regard for the sacrament of their day; if we feel the strongest
admiration for the Maccabees, who refused to touch food which Christians lawfully use; 691
how much more should a Christian in our day be ready to suffer all things for Christ’s
baptism, for Christ’s Eucharist, for Christ’s sacred sign, since these are proofs of the accomplishment
of what the former sacraments only pointed forward to in the future! For what
is still promised to the Church, the body of Christ, is both clearly made known, and in the
Saviour Himself, the Head of the body, the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus, has already been accomplished. Is not the promise of eternal life by resurrection from
the dead? This we see fulfilled in the flesh of Him of whom it is said, that the Word became
flesh and dwelt among us.692 In former days faith was dim, for the saints and righteous
men of those times all believed and hoped for the same things, and all these sacraments and
ceremonies pointed to the future; but now we have the revelation of the faith to which the
people were shut up under the law;693 and what is now promised to believers in the judgment
is already accomplished in the example of Him who came not to destroy the law and the
prophets, but to fulfill them.</p>
<p>15. It is a question among the students of the sacred Scriptures, whether the faith in
Christ before His passion and resurrection, which the righteous men of old learned by revelation
or gathered from prophecy, had the same efficacy as faith has now that Christ has
suffered and risen; or whether the actual shedding of the blood of the Lamb of God, which
was, as He Himself says, for many for the remission of sins,694 conferred any benefit in the
<note type="footnote">690 Rom. i. 17.</note>

<note type="footnote">693 Gal. iii. 23.</note>

<pb n="421"/>
way of purifying or adding to the purity of those who looked forward in faith to the death
of Christ, but left the world before it took place; whether, in fact, Christ’s death reached to
the dead, so as to effect their liberation. To discuss this question here, or to prove what has
been ascertained on the subject, would take too long, besides being foreign from our present
purpose.</p>
<p>16. Meanwhile it is sufficient to prove, in opposition to Faustus’ ignorant cavils, how
greatly they mistake who conclude, from the change in signs and sacraments, that there
must be a difference in the things which were prefigured in the rites of a prophetic dispensation,
and which are declared to be accomplished in the rites of the gospel; or those, on the
other hand, who think that as the things are the same, the sacraments which announce their
accomplishment should not differ from the sacraments which foretold that accomplishment.
For if in language the form of the verb changes in the number of letters and syllables according
to the tense, as done signifies the past, and to be done the future, why should not the
symbols which declare Christ’s death and resurrection to be accomplished, differ from those
which predicted their accomplishment, as we see a difference in the form and sound of the
words, past and future, suffered and to suffer, risen and to rise? For material symbols are
nothing else than visible speech, which, though sacred, is changeable and transitory. For
while God is eternal, the water of baptism, and all that is material in the sacrament, is
transitory: the very word "God," which must be pronounced in the consecration, is a sound
which passes in a moment. The actions and sounds pass away, but their efficacy remains
the same, and the spiritual gift thus communicated is eternal. To say, therefore, that if Christ
had not destroyed the law and the prophets, the sacraments of the law and the prophets
would continue to be observed in the congregations of the Christian Church, is the same
as to say that if Christ had not destroyed the law and the prophets, He would still be predicted
as about to be born, to suffer, and to rise again; whereas, in fact, it is proved that He did not
destroy, but fulfill those things, because the prophecies of His birth, and passion, and resurrection,
which were represented in these ancient sacraments, have ceased, and the sacraments
now observed by Christians contain the announcement that He has been born, has suffered,
has risen. He who came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, by this
fulfillment did away with those things which foretold the accomplishment of what is thus
shown to be now accomplished. Precisely in the same way, he might substitute for the expressions,
"He is to be born, is to suffer, is to rise," which were in these times appropriate,
the expressions, "He has been born, has suffered, has risen," which are appropriate now that
the others are accomplished, and so done away.</p>
<p>17. Corresponding to this change in words is the change which naturally took place in
the substitution of new sacraments instead of those of the Old Testament. In the case of
the first Christians, who came to the faith as Jews, it was by degrees that they were brought
to change their customs, and to have a clear perception of the truth; and permission was

<pb n="422"/>
given them by the apostle to preserve their hereditary worship and belief, in which they had
been born and brought up; and those who had to do with them were required to make allowance
for this reluctance to accept new customs. So the apostle circumcised Timothy,
the son of a Jewish mother and a Greek father, when they went among people of this kind;
and he himself accommodated his practice to theirs, not hypocritically, but for a wise purpose.
For these practices were harmless in the case of those born and brought up in them,
though they were no longer required to prefigure things to come. It would have done more
harm to condemn them as hurtful in the case of those to whose time it was intended that
they should continue. Christ, who came to fulfill all these prophecies, found those people
trained in their own religion. But in the case of those who had no such training, but were
brought to Christ, the corner-stone, from the opposite wall of circumcision, there was no
obligation to adopt Jewish customs. If, indeed, like Timothy, they chose to accommodate
themselves to the views of those of the circumcision who were still wedded to their old sacraments,
they were free to do so. But if they supposed that their hope and salvation depended
on these works of the law, they were warned against them as a fatal danger. So the apostle
says: "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;"
695 that is, if they were circumcised, as they were intending to be, in compliance with
some corrupt teachers, who told them that without these works of the law they could not
be saved. For when, chiefly through the preaching of the Apostle Paul, the Gentiles were
coming to the faith of Christ, as it was proper that they should come, without being burdened
with Jewish observances—for those who were grown up were deterred from the faith by
fear of ceremonies to which they were not accustomed, especially of circumcision; and if
they who had not been trained from their birth to such observances had been made proselytes
in the usual way, it would have implied that the coming of Christ still required to be predicted
as a future event;—when, then, the Gentiles were admitted without these ceremonies, those
of the circumcision who believed, not understanding why the Gentiles were not required
to adopt their customs, nor why they themselves were still allowed to retain them, began to
disturb the Church with carnal contentions, because the Gentiles were admitted into the
people of God without being made proselytes in the usual way by circumcision and the
other legal observances. Some also of the converted Gentiles were bent on these ceremonies,
from fear of the Jews among whom they lived. Against these Gentiles the Apostle Paul often
wrote, and when Peter was carried away by their hypocrisy, he corrected him with a brotherly
rebuke. 696 Afterwards, when the apostles met in council, decreed that these works of the
law were not obligatory in the case of the Gentiles,697 some Christians of the circumcision
<note type="footnote">695 Gal. v. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">696 Gal. ii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">697 Acts. xv. 6-11.</note>

<pb n="423"/>
were displeased, because they failed to understand that these observances were permissible
only in those who had been trained in them before the revelation of faith, to bring to a close
the prophetic life in those who were engaged in it before the prophecy was fulfilled, lest by
a compulsory abandonment it should seem to be condemned rather than closed; while to
lay these things on the Gentiles would imply either that they were not instituted to prefigure
Christ, or that Christ was still to be prefigured. The ancient people of God, before Christ
came to fulfill the law and the prophets, were required to observe all these things by which
Christ was prefigured. It was freedom to those who understood the meaning of the observance,
but it was bondage to those who did not. But the people in those latter times who
come to believe in Christ as having already come, and suffered, and risen, in the case of
those whom this faith found trained to those sacraments, are neither required to observe
them, nor prohibited from doing so; while there is a prohibition in the case of those who
were not bound by the ties of custom, or by any necessity, to accommodate themselves to
the practice of others, so that it might become manifest that these things were instituted to
prefigure Christ, and that after His coming they were to cease, because the promises had
been fulfilled. Some believers of the circumcision who did not understand this were displeased
with this tolerant arrangement which the Holy Spirit effected through the apostles,
and stubbornly insisted on the Gentiles becoming Jews. These are the people of whom
Faustus speaks under the name of Symmachians or Nazareans. Their number is now very
small, but the sect still continues.</p>
<p>18. The Manichæans, therefore have no ground for saying, in disparagement of the law
and the prophets, that Christ came to destroy rather than to fulfill them, because Christians
do not observe what is there enjoined: for the only things which they do not observe are
those that prefigured Christ, and these are not observed because their fulfillment is in Christ,
and what is fulfilled is no longer prefigured; the typical observances having properly come
to a close in the time of those who, after being trained in such things, had come to believe
in Christ as their fulfillment. Do not Christians observe the precept of Scripture "Hear, O
Israel; the Lord thy God is one God;" "Thou shalt not make unto thee an image," and so on?
Do make Christians not observe the precept, "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain?" Do Christians not observe the Sabbath, even in the sense of a true rest? Do
Christians not honor their parents, according to the commandment? Do Christians not
abstain from fornication, and murder, and theft, and false witness, from coveting their
neighbor’s wife, and from coveting his property,—all of which things are written in the law?
These moral precepts are distinct from typical sacraments: the former are fulfilled by the
aid of divine grace, the latter by the accomplishment of what they promise. Both are fulfilled
in Christ, who has ever been the bestower of this grace, which is also now revealed in Him,
and who now makes manifest the accomplishment of what He in former times promised;

<pb n="424"/>
for "the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."698 Again, these
things which concern the keeping of a good conscience are fulfilled in the faith which worketh
by love;699 while types of the future pass away when they are accomplished. But even the
types are not destroyed, but fulfilled; for Christ, in bringing to light what the types signified,
does not prove them vain or illusory.</p>
<p>19. Faustus, therefore, is wrong in supposing that the Lord Jesus fulfilled some precepts
of righteous men who lived before the law of Moses, such as, "Thou shall not kill," which
Christ did not oppose, but rather confirmed by His prohibition of anger and abuse; and
that He destroyed some things apparently peculiar to the Hebrew law, such as, "An eye for
an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," which Christ seems rather to abolish than to confirm, when
He says, "But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but if any one smite thee on thy right
cheek, turn to him the other also,"700 and so on. But we say that even these things which
Faustus thinks Christ destroyed by enjoining the opposite, were suitable to the times of the
Old Testament, and were not destroyed, but fulfilled by Christ.</p>
<p>20. In the first place let me ask our opponents if these ancient righteous men, Enoch
and Seth, whom Faustus mentions particularly, and any others who lived before Moses, or
even, if you choose, before Abraham, were angry with their brother without a cause, or said
to their brother, Thou fool. If not, why may they not have taught these things as well as
preached them? And if they taught these things, how can Christ be said to have fulfilled
their righteousness or their teaching, any more than that of Moses, by adding, "But I say
unto you, if any man is angry with his brother, or if he says Racha, or if he says, Thou fool,
he shall be in danger of the judgment, or of the council, or of hell-fire," since these men did
these very things themselves, and enjoined them upon others? Will it be said that they were
ignorant of its being the duty of a righteous man to restrain his passion, and not to provoke
his brother with angry abuse; or that, knowing this, they were unable to act accordingly?
In that case, they deserved the punishment of hell, and could not have been righteous. But
no one will venture to say that in their righteousness there was such ignorance of duty, and
such a want of self-control, as to make them liable to the punishment of hell. How, then,
can Christ be said to have fulfilled the law, by which these men lived by means of adding
things without which they could have had no righteousness at all? Will it be said that a
hasty temper and bad language are sinful only since the time of Christ, while formerly such
qualities of the heart and speech were allowable; as we find some institutions vary according
to the times, so that what is proper at one time is improper at another, and vice versa? You
will not be so foolish as to make this assertion. But even were you to do so, the reply will

<note type="footnote">700 Matt. v. 38, 39.</note>

<pb n="425"/>
be that, according to this idea, Christ came not to fulfill what was defective in the old law,
but to institute a law which did not previously exist; if it is true that with the righteous men
of old it was not a sin to say to their brother, Thou fool, which Christ pronounces so sinful,
that whoever does so is in danger of hell. So, then, you have not succeeded in finding any
law of which it can be said that Christ supplied its defect by these additions.</p>
<p>21. Will it be said that the law in these early times was incomplete as regards not committing
adultery, till it was completed by the Lord, who added that no one should look on
a woman to lust after her? This is what you imply in the way you quote the words, "Ye have
heard that it has been said, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, Do not lust
even." "Here," you say, "is the fulfillment." But let us take the words as they stand in the
Gospel, without any of your modifications, and see what character you give to those righteous
men of antiquity. The words are: "Ye have heard that it has been said, thou shall not commit
adultery; but I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath
committed adultery with her already in his heart."701 In your opinion, then, Enoch and
Seth, and the rest, committed adultery in their hearts; and either their heart was not the
temple of God, or they committed adultery in the temple of God. But if you dare not say
this, how can you say that Christ, when He came, fulfilled the law, which was already in the
time of those men complete?</p>
<p>22. As regards not swearing, in which also you say that Christ completed the law given
to these righteous men of antiquity, I cannot be certain that they did not swear, for we find
that Paul the apostle swore. With you, swearing is still a common practice, for you swear
by the light, which you love as flies do; for the light of the mind which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world, as distinct from mere natural light, you know nothing of. You
swear, too, by your master Manichæus, whose name in his own tongue was Manes. As the
name Manes seemed to be connected with the Greek word for madness, you have changed
it by adding a suffix, which only makes matters worse, by giving the new meaning of pouring
forth madness. One of your own sect told me that the name Manichæus was intended to
be derived from the Greek words for pouring forth manna; for χέειν means to pour. But,
as it is, you only express the idea of madness with greater emphasis. For by adding the two
syllables, while you have forgotten to insert another letter in the beginning of the word, you
make it not Mannichæus, but Manichæus; which must mean that he pours forth madness
in his long unprofitable discourses. Again, you often swear by the Paraclete,—not the
Paraclete promised and sent by Christ to His disciples, but this same madness-pourer himself.
Since, then, you are constantly swearing, I should like to know in what sense you make
Christ to have fulfilled this part of the law, which is one you mention as belonging to the
earliest times. And what do you make of the oaths of the apostle? For as to your authority,
<note type="footnote">701 Matt. v. 27, 28.</note>

<pb n="426"/>
it cannot weigh much with yourselves, not to speak of me or any other person. It is therefore
evident that Christ’s words, "I am come not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it," have not the
meaning which you give them. Christ makes no reference in these words to His comments
on the ancient sayings which He quotes, and of which His discourse was an explanation,
but not a fulfillment.</p>
<p>23. Thus, as regards murder, which was understood to mean merely the destruction of
the body, by which a man is deprived of life, the Lord explained that every unjust disposition
to injure our brother is a kind of murder. So John also says, "He that hateth his brother is
a murderer."702 And as it was thought that adultery meant only the act of unlawful intercourse
with a woman, the Master showed that the lust He describes is also adultery. Again,
because perjury is a heinous sin, while there is no sin either in not swearing at all or in
swearing truly, the Lord wished to secure us from departing from the truth by not swearing
at all, rather than that we should be in danger of perjury by being in the habit of swearing
truly. For one who never swears is less in danger of swearing falsely than one who is in the
habit of swearing truly. So, in the discourses of the apostle which are recorded, he never
used an oath, lest he should ever fall unawares into perjury from being in the habit of
swearing. In his writings, on the other hand, where he had more leisure and opportunity
for caution, we find him using oaths in several places,703 to teach us that there is no sin in
swearing truly, but that, on account of the infirmity of human nature, we are best preserved
from perjury by not swearing at all. These considerations will also make it evident that the
things which Faustus supposes to be peculiar to Moses were not destroyed by Christ, as he
says they were.</p>
<p>24. To take, for instance, this saying of the ancients, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and
hate thine enemy," how does Faustus make out that this is peculiar to Moses? Does not the
Apostle Paul speak of some men as hateful to God?704 And, indeed, in connection with this
saying, the Lord enjoins on us that we should imitate God. His words are: "That ye may
be the children of your Father in heaven, who maketh the sun to rise upon the evil and the
good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust."705 In one sense we must hate our enemies,
after the example of God, to whom Paul says some men are hateful; while, at the same time,
we must also love our enemies after the example of God, who makes the sun to rise on the
evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust. If we understand this, we
shall find that the Lord, in explaining to those who did not rightly understand the saying,
Thou shalt hate thine enemy, made use of it to show that they should love their enemy,

<pb n="427"/>
which was a new idea to them. It would take too long to show the consistency of the two
things here. But when the Manichæans condemn without exception the precept, Thou shall
hate thine enemy, they may easily be met with the question whether their god loves the race
of darkness. Or, if we should love our enemies now, because they have a part of good, should
we not also hate them as having a part of evil? So even in this way it would appear that there
is no opposition between the saying of ancient times, Thou shall hate thine enemy, and that
of the Gospel, Love your enemies. For every wicked man should be hated as far as he is
wicked; while he should be loved as a man. The vice which we rightly hate in him is to be
condemned, that by its removal the human nature which we rightly love in him may be
amended. This is precisely the principle we maintain, that we should hate our enemy for
what is evil in him, that is, for his wickedness; while we also love our enemy for that which
is good in him, that is, for his nature as a social and rational being. The difference between
us and the Manichæans is, that we prove the man to be wicked, not by nature, either his
own or any other, but by his own will; whereas they think that a man is evil on account of
the nature of the race of darkness, which, according to them, was an object of dread to God
when he existed entire, and by which also he was partly conquered, so that he cannot be
entirely set free. The intention of the Lord, then, is to correct those who, from knowing
without understanding what was said by them of old time, Thou shalt hate thine enemy,
hated their fellow-men instead of only hating their wickedness; and for this purpose He
says, Love your enemies. Instead of destroying what is written about hatred of enemies in
the law, of which He said, "I am come not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it," He would have
us learn, from the duty of loving our enemies, how it is possible in the case of one and the
same person, both to hate him for his sin, and to love him for his nature. It is too much to
expect our perverse opponents to understand this. But we can silence them, by showing
that by their irrational objection they condemn their own god, of whom they cannot say
that he loves the race of darkness; so that in enjoining on every one to love his enemy, they
cannot quote his example. There would appear to be more love of their enemy in the race
of darkness than in the god of the Manichæans. The story is, that the race of darkness
coveted the domain of light bordering on their territory, and, from a desire to possess it,
formed the plan of invading it. Nor is there any sin in desiring true goodness and blessedness.
For the Lord says, "The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it
by force."706 This fabulous race of darkness, then, wished to take by force the good they
desired, for its beautiful and attractive appearance. But God, instead of returning the love
of those who wished to possess Him, hated it so as to endeavor to annihilate them. If,
therefore, the evil love the good in the desire to possess it, while the good hate the evil in
fear of being defiled, I ask the Manichæans, which of these obeys the precept of the Lord,
<note type="footnote">706 Matt. xi. 12.</note>

<pb n="428"/>
"Love your enemies"? If you insist on making these precepts opposed to one another, it will
follow that your god obeyed what is written in the law of Moses, "Thou shall hate thine enemy";
while the race of darkness obeyed what is written in the Gospel, "Love your enemies."
However, you have never succeeded in explaining the difference between the flies that fly
in the day-time and the moths that fly at night; for both, according to you, belong to the
race of darkness. How is it that one kind love the light, contrary to their nature; while the
other kind avoid it, and prefer the darkness from which they sprung? Strange, that filthy
sewers should breed a cleaner sort than dark closets!</p>
<p>25. Nor, again, is there any opposition between that which was said by them of old
time, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," and what the Lord says, "But I say unto you,
that ye resist not evil; but if any one smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also," and so on.707 The old precept as well as the new is intended to check the vehemence
of hatred, and to curb the impetuosity of angry passion. For who will of his own accord be
satisfied with a revenge equal to the injury? Do we not see men, only slightly hurt, eager
for slaughter, thirsting for blood, as if they could never make their enemy suffer enough?
If a man receives a blow, does he not summon his assailant, that he may be condemned in
the court of law? Or if he prefers to return the blow, does he not fall upon the man with
hand and heel, or perhaps with a weapon, if he can get hold of one? To put a restraint upon
a revenge so unjust from its excess, the law established the principle of compensation, that
the penalty should correspond to the injury inflicted. So the precept, "an eye for an eye, a
tooth for a tooth," instead of being a brand to kindle a fire that was quenched, was rather a
covering to prevent the fire already kindled from spreading. For there is a just revenge due
to the injured person from his assailant; so that when we pardon, we give up what we might
justly claim. Thus, in the Lord’s prayer, we are taught to forgive others their debts that God
may forgive us our debts. There is no injustice in asking back a debt, though there is kindness
in forgiving it. But as, in swearing, one who swears, even though truly, is in danger of perjury,
of which one is in no danger who never swears; and while swearing truly is not a sin, we are
further from sin by not swearing; so that the command not to swear is a guard against perjury:
in the same way since it is sinful to wish to be revenged with an unjust excess, though
there is no sin in wishing for revenge within the limits of justice, the man who wishes for
no revenge at all is further from the sin of an unjust revenge. It is sin to demand more than
is due, though it is no sin to demand a debt. And the best security against the sin of making
an unjust demand is to demand nothing, especially considering the danger of being compelled
to pay the debt to Him who is indebted to none. Thus, I would explain the passage as follows:
It has been said by them of old time, Thou shall not take unjust revenge; but I say, Take no
revenge at all: here is the fulfillment. It is thus that Faustus, after quoting, "It has been said,
<note type="footnote">707 Ex. xxi. 24, and Matt. v. 39.</note>

<pb n="429"/>
Thou shall not swear falsely; but I say unto you, swear not at all," adds: here is the fulfillment.
I might use the same expression if I thought that by the addition of these words Christ
supplied a defect in the law, and not rather that the intention of the law to prevent unjust
revenge is best secured by not taking revenge at all, in the same way as the intention to
prevent perjury is best secured by not swearing at all. For if "an eye for an eye" is opposed
to "If any one smite thee on the cheek, turn to him the other also," is there not as much opposition
between "Thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath," and "Swear not at all?"708
If Faustus thinks that there is not destruction, but fulfillment, in the one case, he ought to
think the same of the other. For if "Swear not" is the fulfillment of "Swear truly," why should
not "Take no revenge" be the fulfillment of "Take revenge justly"?</p>
<p>So, according to my interpretation, there is in both cases a guard against sin, either of
false swearing or of unjust revenge; though, as regards giving up the right to revenge, there
is the additional consideration that, by forgiving such debts, we shall obtain the forgiveness
of our debts. The old precept was required in the case of a self-willed people, to teach them
not to be extravagant in their demands. Thus, when the rage eager for unrestrained vengeance,
was subdued, there would be leisure for any one so disposed to consider the desirableness
of having his own debt cancelled by the Lord, and so to be led by this consideration
to forgive the debt of his fellow-servant.</p>
<p>26. Again, we shall find on examination, that there is no opposition between the precept
of the Lord about not putting away a wife, and what was said by them of old time: "Whosoever
putteth away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement."709 The Lord explains
the intention of the law, which required a bill of divorce in every case where a wife was put
away. The precept not to put away a wife is the opposite of saying that a man may put away
his wife if he pleases; which is not what the law says. On the contrary, to prevent the wife
from being put away, the law required this intermediate step, that the eagerness for separation
might be checked by the writing of the bill, and the man might have time to think of the
evil of putting away his wife; especially since, as it is said, among the Hebrews it was unlawful
for any but the scribes to write Hebrew: for the scribes claimed the possession of superior
wisdom; and if they were men of upright and pious character, their pursuits might justly
entitle them to make this claim. In requiring, therefore, that in putting away his wife, a man
should give her a writing of divorcement, the design was that he should be obliged to have
recourse to those from whom he might expect to receive a cautious interpretation of the
law, and suitable advice against separation. Having no other way of getting the bill written,
the man should be obliged to submit to their direction, and to allow of their endeavors to
restore peace and harmony between him and his wife. In a case where the hatred could not

<note type="footnote">709 Deut. xxiv. i, and Matt. v. 31, 32.</note>

<pb n="430"/>
be overcome or checked, the bill would of course be written. A wife might with reason be
put away when wise counsel failed to restore the proper feeling and affection in the mind
of her husband. If the wife is not loved, she is to be put away. And that she may not be put
away, it is the husband’s duty to love her. Now, while a man cannot be forced to love against
his will, he may be influenced by advice and persuasion. This was the duty of the scribe, as
a wise and upright man; and the law gave him the opportunity, by requiring the husband
in all cases of quarrel to go to him, to get the bill of divorcement written. No good or prudent
man would write the bill unless it were a case of such obstinate aversion as to make reconciliation
impossible. But according to your impious notions, there can be nothing in putting
away a wife; for matrimony, according to you, is a criminal indulgence. The word "matrimony"
shows that a man takes a wife in order that she may become a mother, which would
be an evil in your estimation. According to you, this would imply that part of your god is
overcome and captured by the race of darkness, and bound in the fetters of flesh.</p>
<p>27. But, to explain the point in hand: If Christ, in adding the words, "But I say unto
you," to the quotations He makes of ancient sayings, neither fulfilled the law of primitive
times by His additions, nor destroyed the law given to Moses by opposite precepts, but
rather paid such deference to the Hebrew law in all the quotations He made from it, as to
make His own remarks chiefly explanatory of what the law stated less distinctly, or a means
of securing the design intended by the law, it follows that from the words, "I came not to
destroy the law, but to fulfill it" we are not to understand that Christ by His precepts filled
up what was wanting in the law; but that what the literal command failed in doing from the
pride and disobedience of men, is accomplished by grace in those who are brought to repentance
and humility. The fulfillment is not in additional words, but in acts of obedience. So
the apostle says "Faith worketh by love;" 710 and again, He that loveth another hath fulfilled
the law."711 This love, by which also the righteousness of the law can be fulfilled was bestowed
in its significance by Christ in His coming, through the spirit which He sent according to
His promise; and therefore He said, "I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it." This is
the New Testament in which the promise of the kingdom of heaven is made to this love;
which was typified in the Old Testament, suitably to the times of that dispensation. So
Christ says again; "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another."712</p>
<p>28. So we find in the Old Testament all or nearly all the counsels and precepts which
Christ introduces with the words "But I say unto you." Against anger it is written, "Mine
eyes troubled because of anger;"713 and again, "Better is he that conquers his anger, than he

<pb n="431"/>
that taketh a city."714 Against hard words, "The stroke of a whip maketh a wound; but the
stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones."715 Against adultery in the heart, "Thou shall not
covet thy neighbor’s wife."716 It is not, "Thou shall not commit adultery;" but, "Thou shall
not covet." The apostle, in quoting this, says: "I had not known lust, unless the law had
said, Thou shalt not covet."717 Regarding patience in not offering resistance, a man is praised
who "giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him, and who is filled full with reproach."718 Of
love to enemies it is said: "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink."719
This also is quoted by the apostle.720 In the Psalm, too, it is said, "I was a peace maker among
them that hated peace;"721 and in many similar passages. In connection also with our imitating
God in refraining from taking revenge, and in loving even the wicked, there is a passage
containing a full description of God in this character; for it is written: "To Thee alone ever
belongeth great strength, and who can withstand the power of Thine arm? For the whole
world before Thee is as a little grain of the balance; yea, as a drop of the morning dew that
falleth down upon the earth. But Thou hast mercy upon all, for Thou canst do all things,
and winkest at the sins of men, because of repentance. For Thou lovest all things that are,
and abhorrest nothing which Thou hast made; for never wouldest Thou have made anything
if Thou hadst hated it. And how could anything have endured, if it had not been Thy will?
or been preserved, if not called by Thee? But Thou sparest all; for they are Thine, O Lord,
Thou lover of souls. For Thy good Spirit is in all things; therefore chastenest Thou them
by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein
they have offended, that learning their wickedness, they may believe in Thee, O Lord."722
Christ exhorts us to imitate this long-suffering goodness of God, who maketh the sun to
rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust; that we may
not be careful to revenge, but may do good to them that hate us, and so may be perfect, even
as our Father in heaven is perfect.723 From another passage in these ancient books we learn

that, by not exacting the vengeance due to us, we obtain the remission of our own sins; and
that by not forgiving the debts of others, we incur the danger of being refused forgiveness
when we pray for the remission of our own debts: "He that revengeth shall find vengeance
from the Lord, and He will surely keep his sin in remembrance. Forgive thy neighbor the
hurt that he hath done to thee; so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest. One
man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon of the Lord? He showeth no
mercy to a man who is like himself; and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins? If he that
is but flesh nourishes hatred, and asks for favor from the Lord, who will entreat for the
pardon of his sins?"724</p>
<p>29. As regards not putting away a wife, there is no need to quote any other passage of
the Old Testament than that referred to most appropriately in the Lord’s reply to the Jews
when they questioned Him on this subject. For when they asked whether it is lawful for a
man to put away his wife for any reason, the Lord answered: "Have ye not read, that He
that made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall
a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one
flesh? Therefore they are no longer twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined,
let no man put asunder."725 Here the Jews, who thought that they acted according to the
intention of the law of Moses in putting away their wives, are made to see from the book of
Moses that a wife should not be put away. And, by the way, we learn here, from Christ’s
own declaration, that God made and joined male and female; so that by denying this, the
Manichæans are guilty of opposing the gospel of Christ as well as the writings of Moses.
And supposing their doctrine to be true, that the devil made and joined male and female,
we see the diabolical cunning of Faustus in finding fault with Moses for dissolving marriages
by granting a bill of divorce, and praising Christ for strengthening the union by the precept
in the Gospel. Instead of this, Faustus, consistently with his own foolish and impious notions,
should have praised Moses for separating what was made and joined by the devil, and should
have blamed Christ for ratifying a bond of the devil’s workmanship. To return, let us hear
the good Master explain how Moses, who wrote of the conjugal chastity in the first union
of male and female as so holy and inviolable, afterwards allowed the people to put away
their wives. For when the Jews replied, "Why did Moses then command to give a writing
of divorcement, and to put her away?" Christ said unto them, "Moses, because of the hardness
of your heart, suffered you to put away your wives."726 This passage we have already explained.
727 The hardness must have been great indeed which could not be induced to admit
<note type="footnote">724 Ecclus. xxviii. 1-5.</note>

<pb n="433"/>
the restoration of wedded love, even though by means of the writing an opportunity was
afforded for advice to be given to this effect by wise and upright men. Then the Lord quoted
the same law, to show both what was enjoined on the good and what was permitted to the
hard; for, from what is written of the union of male and female, He proved that a wife must
not be put away, and pointed out the divine authority for the union; and shows from the
same Scriptures that a bill of divorcement was to be given because of the hardness of the
heart, which might be subdued or might not.</p>
<p>30. Since, then, all these excellent precepts of the Lord, which Faustus tries to prove to
be contrary to the old books of the Hebrews, are found in these very books, the only sense
in which the Lord came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, is this, that besides the fulfillment
of the prophetic types, which are set aside by their actual accomplishment, the precepts
also, in which the law is holy, and just, and good, are fulfilled in us, not by the oldness of
the letter which commands, and increases the offence of the proud by the additional guilt
of transgression, but by the newness of the Spirit, who aids us, and by the obedience of the
humble, through the saving grace which sets us free. For, while all these sublime precepts
are found in the ancient books, still the end to which they point is not there revealed; although
the holy men who foresaw the revelation lived in accordance with it, either veiling it in
prophecy as suited the time, or themselves discovering the truth thus veiled.</p>
<p>31. I am disposed, after careful examination, to doubt whether the expression so often
used by the Lord, "the kingdom of heaven," can be found in these books. It is said, indeed,
"Love wisdom, that ye may reign for ever."728 And if eternal life had not been clearly made
known in the Old Testament, the Lord would not have said, as He did even to the unbelieving
Jews: "Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think that ye have eternal life, and they are they
that testify of me."729 And to the same effect are the words of the Psalmist: "I shall not die,
but live, and declare the works of the Lord."730 And again: "Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep
the sleep of death."731 Again, we read, "The souls of the righteous are in the hand of the
Lord, and pain shall not touch them;" and immediately following: "They are in peace; and
if they have suffered torture from men, their hope is full of immortality; and after a few
trouble, they shall enjoy many rewards."732 Again, in another place: "The righteous shall
live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord, and their concern with the Highest; therefore
shall they receive from the hand of the Lord a kingdom of glory and a crown of beauty."733

These and many similar declarations of eternal life, in more or less explicit terms, are found
in these writings. Even the resurrection of the body is spoken of by the prophets. The
Pharisees, accordingly, were fierce opponents of the Sadducees, who disbelieved the resurrection.
This we learn not only from the canonical Acts of the Apostles, which the
Manichæans reject, because it tells of the advent of the Paraclete promised by the Lord, but
also from the Gospel, when the Sadducees question the Lord about the woman who married
seven brothers, one dying after the other, whose wife she would be in the resurrection.734
As regards, then, eternal life and the resurrection of the dead, numerous testimonies are to
be found in these Scriptures. But I do not find there the expression, "the kingdom of heaven."
This expression belongs properly to the revelation of the New Testament, because in the
resurrection our earthly bodies shall, by that change which Paul fully describes, become
spiritual bodies, and so heavenly, that thus we may possess the kingdom of heaven. And
this expression was reserved for Him whose advent as King to govern and Priest to sanctify
His believing people, was ushered in by all the symbolism of the old covenant, in its genealogies,
its typical acts and words, its sacrifices and ceremonies and feasts, and in all its
prophetic utterances and events and figures. He came full of grace and truth, in His grace
helping us to obey the precepts, and in His truth securing the accomplishment of the
promises. He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.</p>

<p>Faustus repels the charge of sun-worship, and maintains that while the Manichæans believe
that God’s power dwells in the sun and his wisdom in the moon, they yet worship one
deity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are not a schism of the Gentiles, nor a sect.
Augustin emphasizes the charge of polytheism, and goes into an elaborate comparison of
Manichæan and pagan mythology.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You ask why we worship the sun, if we are a sect or separate religion,
and not Pagans, or merely a schism of the Gentiles. It may therefore be as well to inquire
into the matter, that we may see whether the name of Gentiles is more applicable to you or
to us. Perhaps, in giving you in a friendly way this simple account of my faith, I shall appear
to be making an apology for it, as if I were ashamed, which God forbid, of doing homage
to the divine luminaries. You may take it as you please; but I shall not regret what I have
done if I succeed in conveying to some at least this much knowledge, that our religion has
nothing in common with that of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>2. We worship, then, one deity under the threefold appellation of the Almighty God
the Father, and his son Christ, and the Holy Spirit. While these are one and the same, we
believe also that the Father properly dwells in the highest or principal light, which Paul calls
"light inaccessible,"735 and the Son in his second or visible light. And as the Son is himself
twofold, according to the apostle, who speaks of Christ as the power of God and the wisdom
of God,736 we believe that His power dwells in the sun, and His wisdom in the moon. We
also believe that the Holy Spirit, the third majesty, has His seat and His home in the whole
circle of the atmosphere. By His influence and spiritual infusion, the earth conceives and
brings forth the mortal Jesus, who, as hanging from every tree, is the life and salvation of
men.737 Though you oppose these doctrines so violently, your religion resembles ours in
attaching the same sacredness to the bread and wine that we do to everything. This is our
belief, which you will have an opportunity of hearing more of, if you wish to do so. Meanwhile
there is some force in the consideration that you or any one that is asked where his
God dwells, will say that he dwells in light; so that the testimony in favor of my worship is
almost universal.</p>

Of course, this is only a way of expressing the familiar Manichæan notion that the divine life which is imprisoned
in the world and which is trying to escape through the growth of plants, etc., suffers from any sort of injury done
to plants. Compare Baur: Das Manichäische Religionssystem, pp. 72-77.—A.H.N.]</note>

<p>3. As to your calling us a schism of the Gentiles, and not a sect, I suppose the word
schism applies to those who have the same doctrines and worship as other people, and only
choose to meet separately. The word sect, again, applies to those whose doctrine is quite
unlike that of others, and who have made a form of divine worship peculiar to themselves.
If this is what the words mean, in the first place, in our doctrine and worship we have no
resemblance to the Pagans. We shall see presently whether you have. The Pagan doctrine
is, that all things good and evil, mean and glorious, fading and unfading, changeable and
unchangeable, material and divine, have only one principle. In opposition to this, my belief
is that God is the principle of all good things, and Hyle [matters] of the opposite. Hyle is
the name given by our master in divinity to the principle or nature of evil. The Pagans accordingly
think it right to worship God with altars, and shrines, and images, and sacrifices,
and incense. Here also my practice differs entirely from theirs: for I look upon myself as a
reasonable temple of God, if I am worthy to be so; and I consider Christ his Son as the living
image of his living majesty; and I hold a mind well cultivated to be the true altar, and pure
and simple prayers to be the true way of paying divine honors and of offering sacrifices. Is
this being a schism of the Pagans?</p>
<p>4. As regards the worship of the Almighty God, you might call us a schism of the Jews,
for all Jews are bold enough to profess this worship, were it not for the difference in the
form of our worship, though it may be questioned whether the Jews really worship the
Almighty. But the doctrine I have mentioned is common to the Pagans in their worship of
the sun, and to the Jews in their worship of the Almighty. Even in relation to you, we are
not properly a schism, though we acknowledge Christ and worship Him; for our worship
and doctrine are different from yours. In a schism, little or no change is made from the
original; as, for instance, you, in your schism from the Gentiles, have brought with you the
doctrine of a single principle, for you believe that all things are of God. The sacrifices you
change into love-feasts, the idols into martyrs, to whom you pray as they do to their idols.
You appease the shades of the departed with wine and food. You keep the same holidays
as the Gentiles; for example, the calends and the solstices. In your way of living you have
made no change. Plainly you are a mere schism; for the only difference from the original
is that you meet separately. In this you have followed the Jews, who separated from the
Gentiles, but differed only in not having images. For they used temples, and sacrifices, and
altars, and a priesthood, and the whole round of ceremonies the same as those of the Gentiles,
only more superstitious. Like the Pagans, they believe in a single principle; so that both you
and the Jews are schisms of the Gentiles, for you have the same faith, and nearly the same
worship, and you call yourselves sects only because you meet separately. The fact is, there
are only two sects, the Gentiles and ourselves. We and the Gentiles are as contrary in our
belief as truth and falsehood, day and night, poverty and wealth, health and sickness. You,

<pb n="437"/>
again, are not a sect in relation either to truth or to error. You are merely a schism and a
schism not of truth, but of error.</p>
<p>5. Augustin replied: O hateful mixture of ignorance and cunning! Why do you put
arguments in the mouth of your opponent, which no one that knows you would use? We
do not call you Pagans, or a schism of Pagans; but we say that you resemble them in worshipping
many gods. But you are far worse than Pagans, for they worship things which exist,
though they should not be worshipped: for idols have an existence, though for salvation
they are nought. So, to worship a tree with prayers, instead of improving it by cultivation,
is not to worship nothing, but to worship in a wrong way. When the apostle says that "the
things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God,"738 he means
that these demons exist to whom the sacrifices are made, and with whom he wishes us not
to be partakers. So, too, heaven and earth, the sea and air, the sun and moon, and the other
heavenly bodies, are all objects which have a sensible existence. When the Pagans worship
these as gods, or as parts of one great God (for some of them identify the universe with the
Supreme Deity), they worship things which have an existence. In arguing with Pagans, we
do not deny the existence of these things, but we say that they should not be worshipped;
and we recommend the worship of the invisible Creator of all these things, in whom alone
man can find the happiness which all allow that he desires. To those, again, who worship
what is invisible and immaterial, but still is created, as the soul or mind of man, we say that
happiness is not to be found in the creature even under this form, and that we must worship
the true God, who is not only invisible, but unchangeable; for He alone is to be worshipped,
in the enjoyment of whom the worshipper finds happiness, and without whom the soul
must be wretched, whatever else it possesses. You, on the other hand, who worship things
which have no existence at all except in your fictitious legends, would be nearer true piety
and religion if you were Pagans, or if you were worshippers of what has an existence, though
not a proper object of worship. In fact, you do not properly worship the sun, though he
carries your prayers with him in his course round the heavens.</p>
<p>6. Your statements about the sun himself are so false and absurd, that if he were to repay
you for the injury done to him, he would scorch you to death. First of all, you call the sun
a ship, so that you are not only astray worlds off, as the saying is, but adrift. Next, while
every one sees that the sun is round, which is the form corresponding from its perfection
to his position among the heavenly bodies, you maintain that he is triangular, that is, that
his light shines on the earth through a triangular window in heaven. Hence it is that you
bend and bow your heads to the sun, while you worship not this visible sun, but some imaginary
ship which you suppose to be shining through a triangular opening. Assuredly this
ship would never have been heard of, if the words required for the composition of heretical
<note type="footnote">738 1 Cor. x. 20.</note>

<pb n="438"/>
fictions had to be paid for, like the wood required for the beams of a ship. All this is comparatively
harmless, however ridiculous or pitiable. Very different is your wicked fancy
about youths of both sexes proceeding from this ship, whose beauty excites eager desire in
the princes and princesses of darkness; and so the members of your god are released from
this humiliating confinement in the members of the race of darkness, by means of sinful
passion and sensual appetite. And to these filthy rags of yours you would unite the mystery
of the Trinity; for you say that the Father dwells in a secret light, the power of the Son in
the sun, and His wisdom in the moon, and the Holy Spirit in the air.</p>
<p>7. As for this threefold or rather fourfold fiction, what shall I say of the secret light of
the Father, but that you can think of no light except what you have seen? From your
knowledge of visible light, with which beasts and insects as well as men are familiar, you
form some vague idea in your mind, and call it the light in which God the Father dwells
with His subjects. How can you distinguish between the light by which we see, and that by
which we understand, when, according to your ideas, to understand truth is nothing else
than to form the conception of material forms, either finite or in some cases infinite; and
you actually believe in these wild fancies? It is manifest that the act of my mind in thinking
of your region of light which has no existence, is entirely different from my conception of
Alexandria, which exists, though I have not seen it. And, again, the act of forming a conception
of Alexandria, which I have never seen, is very different from thinking of Carthage,
which I know. But this difference is insignificant as compared with that between my
thinking of material things which I know from seeing them, and my understanding justice,
chastity, faith, truth, love, goodness, and things of this nature. Can you describe this intel-
lectual light, which gives us a clear perception of the distinction between itself and other
things, as well as of the distinction between those things themselves? And yet even this is
not the sense in which it can be said that God is light, for this light is created, whereas God
is the Creator; the light is made, and He is the Maker; the light is changeable. For the intellect
changes from dislike to desire, from ignorance to knowledge, from forgetfulness to recollection;
whereas God remains the same in will, in truth, and in eternity. From God we derive
the beginning of existence, the principle of knowledge, the law of affection. From God all
animals, rational and irrational, derive the nature of their life, the capacity of sensation, the
faculty of emotion. From God all bodies derive their subsistence in extension, their beauty
in number, and their order in weight. This light is one divine being, in an inseparable triune
existence; and yet, without supposing the assumption of any bodily form, you assign to
separate places parts of the immaterial, spiritual, and unchangeable substance. And instead
of three places for the Trinity, you have four: one, the light inaccessible, which you know
nothing about, for the Father; two, the sun and moon, for the Son; and again one, the circle
of the atmosphere, for the Holy Spirit. Of the inaccessible light of the Father I shall say

<pb n="439"/>
nothing further at present, for orthodox believers do not separate the Son and the Spirit
from the Father in relation to this light.</p>
<p>8. It is difficult to understand how you have been taken with the absurd idea of placing
the power of the Son in the sun, and His wisdom in the moon. For, as the Son remains inseparably
in the Father, His wisdom and power cannot be separated from one another, so
that one should be in the sun and the other in the moon. Only material things can be thus
assigned to separate places. If you only understood this, it would have prevented you from
taking the productions of a diseased fancy as the material for so many fictions. But there
is inconsistency and improbability as well as falsehood in your ideas. For, according to you,
the seat of wisdom is inferior in brightness to the seat of power. Now energy and productiveness
are the qualities of power, whereas light teaches and manifests; so that if the sun had
the greater heat, and the moon the greater light, these absurdities might appear to have some
likelihood to men of carnal minds, who know nothing except through material conceptions.
From the connection between great heat and motion, they might identify power with heat;
while light from its brightness, and as making things discernible, they might represent wisdom.
But what folly as well as profanity, in placing power in the sun, which excels so much
in light, and wisdom in the moon, which is so inferior in brightness! And while you separate
Christ from Himself, you do not distinguish between Christ and the Holy Spirit; whereas
Christ is one, the power of God, and the wisdom of God, and the Spirit is a distinct person.
But according to you, the air, which you make the seat of the Spirit, fills and pervades the
universe. So the sun and moon in their course are always united to the air. But the moon
approaches the sun at one time, and recedes from it at another. So that, if we may believe
you, or rather, if we may allow ourselves to be imposed on by you, wisdom recedes from
power by half the circumference of a circle, and again approaches it by the other half. And
when wisdom is full, it is at a distance from power. For when the moon is full, the distance
between the two bodies is so great, that the moon rises in the east while the sun is setting in
the west. But as the loss of power produces weakness, the fuller the moon is, the weaker
must wisdom be. If, as is certainly true, the wisdom of God is unchangeable in power, and
the power of God unchangeable in wisdom, how can you separate them so as to assign them
to different places? And how can the place be different when the substance is the same? Is
this not the infatuation of subjection to material fancies; showing such a want of power and
wisdom that your wisdom is as weak as your power is foolish? This execrable absurdity
would divide Christ between the sun and the moon,—His power in one, and His wisdom
in the other; so that He would be incomplete in both, lacking wisdom in the sun, and power
in the moon, while in both He supplies youths, male and female, to excite the affection of
the princes and princesses of darkness. Such are the tenets which you learn and profess.
Such is the faith which directs your conduct. And can you wonder that you are regarded
with abhorrence?</p>

<pb n="440"/>
<p>9. But besides your errors regarding these conspicuous and familiar luminaries, which
you worship not for what they are, but for what your wild fancy makes them to be, your
other absurdities are still worse than this. Your illustrious World-bearer, and Atlas who
helps to hold him up, are unreal beings. Like innumerable other creatures of your fancy,
they have no existence, and yet you worship them. For this reason we say that you are worse
than Pagans, while you resemble them in worshipping many gods. You are worse, because,
while they worship things which exist though they are not gods, you worship things which
are neither gods nor anything else, for they have no existence. The Pagans, too, have fables,
but they know them to be fables; and either look upon them as amusing poetical fancies, or
try to explain them as representing the nature of things, or the life of man. Thus they say
that Vulcan is lame, because flame in common fire has an irregular motion: that Fortune
is blind, because of the uncertainty of what are called fortuitous occurrences: that there are
three Fates, with distaff, and spindle, and fingers spinning wool into thread, because there
are three times,—the past, already spun and wound on the spindle; the present, which is
passing through the fingers of the spinner; and the future, still in wool bound to the distaff,
and soon to pass through the fingers to the spindle, that is, through the present into the future:
and that Venus is the wife of Vulcan, because pleasure has a natural connection with
heat; and that she is the mistress of Mars, because pleasure is not properly the companion
of warriors: and that Cupid is a boy with wings and a bow, from the wounds inflicted by
thoughtless, inconstant passion in the hearts of unhappy beings: and so with many other
fables. The great absurdity is in their continuing to worship these beings, after giving such
explanations; for the worship without the explanations, though criminal, would be a less
heinous crime. The very explanations prove that they do not worship that God, the enjoyment
of whom can alone give happiness, but things which He has created. And even in the
creature they worship not only the virtues, as in Minerva, who sprang from the head of
Jupiter, and who represents prudence,—a quality of reason which, according to Plato, has
its seat in the head,—but their vices, too, as in Cupid. Thus one of their dramatic poets says,
"Sinful passion, in favor of vice, made Love a god."739 Even bodily evils had temples in
Rome, as in the case of pallor and fever. Not to dwell on the sin of the worshippers of these
idols, who are in a way affected by the bodily forms, so that they pay homage to them as
deities, when they see them set up in some lofty place, and treated with great honor and
reverence, there is greater sin in the very explanations which are intended as apologies for
these dumb, and deaf, and blind, and lifeless objects. Still, though, as I have said, these
things are nothing in the way of salvation or of usefulness, both they and the things they
are said to represent are real existences. But your First Man, warring with the five elements;
and your Mighty Spirit, who constructs the world from the captive bodies of the race of
<note type="footnote">739 Sen. Hipp. vv. 194, 195.</note>

<pb n="441"/>
darkness, or rather from the members of your god in subjection and bondage; and your
World-holder, who has in his hand the remains of these members, and who bewails the
capture and bondage and pollution of the rest; and your giant Atlas, who keeps up the
World-holder on his shoulders, lest he should from weariness throw away his burden, and
so prevent the completion of the final imitation of the mass of darkness, which is to be the
last scene in your drama;—these and countless other absurdities are not represented in
painting or sculpture, or in any explanation; and yet you believe and worship things which
have no existence, while you taunt the Christians with being credulous for believing in
realities with a faith which pacifies the mind under its influence. The objects of your worship
can be shown to have no existence by many proofs, which I do not bring forward here, because,
though I could without difficulty discourse philosophically on the construction of
the world, it would take too long to do so here. One proof suffices. If these things are real,
God must be subject to change, and corruption, and contamination; a supposition as blasphemous
as it is irrational. All these things, therefore, are vain, and false, and unreal. Thus
you are much worse than those Pagans, with whom all are familiar, and who still preserve
traces of their old customs, of which they themselves are ashamed; for while they worship
things which are not gods, you worship things which do not exist.</p>
<p>10. If you think that your doctrines are true because they are unlike the errors of the
Pagans, and that we are in error because we perhaps differ more from you than from them,
you might as well say that a dead man is in good health because he is not sick; or that good
health is undesirable, because it differs less from sickness than from death. Or if the Pagans
should be viewed in many cases as rather dead than sick, you might as well praise the ashes
in the tomb because they have no longer the human shape, as compared with the living
body, which does not differ so much from a corpse as from ashes. It is thus we are reproached
for having more resemblance to the dead body of Paganism than to the ashes of Manichæism.
But in division, it often happens that a thing is placed in different classes, according to the
point of resemblance on which the division proceeds. For instance, if animals are divided
into those that fly and those that cannot fly, in this division men and beasts are classed to-
gether as distinct from birds, because they are both unable to fly. But if they are divided
into rational and irrational, beasts and birds are classed together as distinct from men, for
they are both destitute of reason. Faustus did not think of this when he said: There are in
fact only two sects, the Gentiles and ourselves, for we are directly opposed to them in our
belief. The opposition he means is this, that the Gentiles believe in a single principle,
whereas the Manichæans believe also in the principle of the race of darkness. Certainly,
according to this division we agree in general with the Pagans. But if we divide all who have
a religion into those who worship one God and those who worship many gods, the
Manichæans must be classed along with the Pagans, and we along with the Jews. This is
another distinction, which may be said to make only two sects. Perhaps you will say that

<pb n="442"/>
you hold all your gods to be of one substance, which the Pagans do not. But you at least
resemble them in assigning to your gods different powers, and functions, and employments.
One does battle with the race of darkness; another constructs the world from the part which
is captured; another, standing above, has the world in his hand; another holds him up from
below; another turns the wheels of the fires and winds and waters beneath; another, in his
circuit of the heavens, gathers with his beams the members of your god from cesspools.
Indeed, your gods have innumerable occupations, according to your fabulous descriptions,
which you neither explain nor represent in a visible form. But again, if men were divided
into those who believe that God takes an interest in human affairs and those who do not,
the Pagans and Jews, and you and all heretics that have anything of Christianity, will be
classed together, as opposed to the Epicureans, and any others holding similar views. As
this is a principle of importance, here again we may say that there are only two sects, and
you belong to the same sect as we do. You will hardly venture to dissent from us in the
opinion that God is concerned in human affairs, so that in this matter your opposition to
the Epicureans makes you side with us. Thus, according to the nature of the division, what
is in one class at one time, is in another at another time: things joined here are separated
there: in some things we are classed with others, and they with us; in other things we are
classed separately, and stand alone. If Faustus thought of this, he would not talk such eloquent
nonsense.</p>
<p>11. But what are we to make of these words of Faustus: The Holy Spirit, by his influence
and spiritual infusion, makes the earth conceive and bring forth the mortal Jesus, who, as
hanging from every tree, is the life and salvation of men? Letting pass for a moment the
absurdity of this statement, we observe the folly of believing that the mortal Jesus can be
conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit by the earth, but not by the Virgin Mary.
Dare you compare the holiness of that chaste virgin’s womb with any piece of ground where
trees and plants grow? Do you pretend to look with abhorrence upon a pure virgin, while
you do not shrink from believing that Jesus is produced in gardens watered by the filthy
drains of a city? For plants of all kinds spring up and are nourished in such moisture. You
will have Jesus to be born in this way, while you cry out against the idea of His being born
of a virgin. Do you think flesh more unclean than the excrements which its nature rejects?
Is the filth cleaner than the flesh which expels it? Are you not aware how fields are manured
in order to make them productive? Your folly comes to this, that the Holy Spirit, who, according
to you, despised the womb of Mary, makes the earth conceive more fruitfully in
proportion as it is carefully enriched with animal off-scourings. Do you reply that the Holy
Spirit preserves His incorruptible purity everywhere? I ask again, Why not also in the virgin’s
womb? Passing from the conception, you maintain in regard to the mortal Jesus—who, as
you say, is born from the earth, which has conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit—that
He hangs in the shape of fruit from every tree: so that, besides this pollution, He suffers

<pb n="443"/>
additional defilement from the flesh of the countless animals that eat the fruit; except, indeed,
the small amount that is purified by your eating it. While we believe and confess Christ the
Son of God, and the Word of God, to have become flesh without suffering defilement, because
the divine substance is not defiled by flesh, as it is not defiled by anything, your fanciful
notions would make Jesus to be defiled even as hanging on the tree, before entering the flesh
of any animal; for if He were not defiled, there would be no need of His being purified by
your eating Him. And if all trees are the cross of Christ, as Faustus seems to imply when
he says that Jesus hangs from every tree, why do you not pluck the fruit, and so take Jesus
down from hanging on the tree to bury Him in your stomach, which would correspond to
the good deed of Joseph of Arimathea, when he took down the true Jesus from the cross to
bury Him?740 Why should it be impious to take Christ from the tree, while it is pious to lay
Him in the tomb? Perhaps you wish to apply to yourselves the words quoted from the
prophet by Paul, "Their throat is an open sepulchre:"741 and so you wait with open mouth
till some one comes to use your throat as the best sepulchre for Christ. Once more, how
many Christs do you make? Is there one whom you call the mortal Christ, whom the earth
conceives and brings forth by the power of the Holy Spirit; and another crucified by the
Jews under Pontius Pilate; and a third whom you divide between the sun and the moon?
Or is it one and the same person, part of whom is confined in the trees, to be released by
the help of the other part which is not confined? If this is the case, and you allow that Christ
suffered under Pontius Pilate, though it is difficult to see how he could have suffered without
flesh, as you say he did, the great question is, with whom he left those ships you speak of,
that he might come down and suffer these things, which he certainly could not have suffered
without having a body of some kind. A mere spiritual presence could not have made him
liable to these sufferings, and in his bodily presence he could not be at the same time in the
sun, in the moon, and on the cross. So, then, if he had not a body, he was not crucified; and
if he had a body, the question is, where he got it: for, according to you, all bodies belong to
the race of darkness, though you cannot think of the divine substance except as being material.
Thus you must say either that Christ was crucified without a body; which is utterly
absurd; or that he was crucified in appearance and not in reality, which is blasphemy; or
that all bodies do not belong to the race of darkness, but that the divine substance has also
a body, and that not an immortal body, but liable to crucifixion and death, which, again, is
altogether erroneous; or that Christ had a mortal body from the race of darkness, so that,
while you will not allow that Christ’s body came from the Virgin Mary, you derive it from
the race of demons. Finally, as in Faustus’ statement, in which he alludes in the briefest
manner possible to the lengthy stories of Manichæan invention, the earth by the power of
<note type="footnote">740 John xix. 38.</note>
<note type="footnote">741 Rom. iii. 13.</note>

<pb n="444"/>
the Holy Spirit conceives and brings forth the mortal Jesus, who, hanging from every tree,
is the life and salvation of men, why should this Saviour be represented by whatever is
hanging, because he hung on the tree, and not by whatever is born, because he was born?
But if you mean that the Jesus on the trees, and the Jesus crucified under Pontius Pilate, and
the Jesus divided between the sun and the moon, are all one and the same substance, why
do you not give the name of Jesus to your whole host of deities? Why should not your
World-holder be Jesus too, and Atlas, and the King of Honour, and the Mighty Spirit, and
the First Man, and all the rest, with their various names and occupations?</p>
<p>12. So, with regard to the Holy Spirit, how can you say that he is the third person, when
the persons you mention are innumerable? Or why is he not Jesus himself? And why does
Faustus mislead people, in trying to make out an agreement between himself and true
Christians, from whom he differs only too widely, by saying, We worship one God under
the threefold appellation of the Almighty God the Father, Christ his Son, and the Holy
Spirit? Why is the appellation only threefold, instead of being manifold? And why is the
distinction in appellation only, and not in reality, if there are as many persons as there are
names? For it is not as if you gave three names to the same thing, as the same weapon may
be called a short sword, a dagger, or a dirk; or as you give the name of moon, and the lesser
ship, and the luminary of night, and so on, to the same thing. For you cannot say that the
First Man is the same as the Mighty Spirit, or as the World-Holder, or as the giant Atlas.
They are all distinct persons, and you do not call any of them Christ. How can there be one
Deity with opposite functions? Or why should not Christ himself be the single person, if
in one substance Christ hangs on the trees, and was persecuted by the Jews, and exists in
the sun and moon? The fact is, your fancies are all astray, and are no better than the dreams
of insanity.</p>
<p>13. How can Faustus think that we resemble the Manichæans in attaching sacredness
to bread and wine, when they consider it sacrilege to taste wine? They acknowledge their
god in the grape, but not in the cup; perhaps they are shocked at his being trampled on and
bottled. It is not any bread and wine that we hold sacred as a natural production, as if Christ
were confined in corn or in vines, as the Manichæans fancy, but what is truly consecrated
as a symbol. What is not consecrated, though it is bread and wine, is only nourishment or
refreshment, with no sacredness about it; although we bless and thank God for every gift,
bodily as well as spiritual. According to your notion, Christ is confined in everything you
eat, and is released by digestion from the additional confinement of your intestines. So,
when you eat, your god suffers; and when you digest, you suffer from his recovery. When
he fills you, your gain is his loss. This might be considered kindness on his part, because
he suffers in you for your benefit, were it not that he gains freedom by escaping and leaving
you empty. There is not the least resemblance between our reverence for the bread and
wine, and your doctrines, which have no truth in them. To compare the two is even more

<pb n="445"/>
foolish than to say, as some do, that in the bread and wine we worship Ceres and Bacchus.
I refer to this now, to show where you got your silly idea that our fathers kept the Sabbath
in honor of Saturn. For as there is no connection with the worship of the Pagan deities
Ceres and Bacchus in our observance of the sacrament of the bread and wine, which you
approve so highly that you wish to resemble us in it, so there was no subjection to Saturn
in the case of our fathers, who observed the rest of the Sabbath in a manner suitable to
prophetic times.</p>
<p>14. You might have found a resemblance in your religion to that of the Pagans as regards
Hyle [matter], which the Pagans often speak of. You, on the contrary, maintain that you
are directly opposed to them in your belief in the evil principle which your teacher in theology
calls Hyle. But here you only show your ignorance, and, with an affectation of learning,
use this word without knowing what it means. The Greeks, when speaking of nature, give
the name Hyle to the subject-matter of things, which has no form of its own, but admits of
all bodily forms, and is known only through these changeable phenomena, not being itself
an object of sensation or perception. Some Gentiles, indeed, erroneously make this matter
co-eternal with God, as not being derived from Him, though the bodily forms are. In this
manifest error you resemble the Pagans, for you hold that Hyle has a principle of its own,
and does not come from God. It is only ignorance that leads you to deny this resemblance.
In saying that Hyle has no form of its own, and can take its forms only from God, the Pagans
come near to the truth which we believe in contradistinction from your errors. Not knowing
what Hyle or the subject-matter of things is, you make it the race of darkness, in which you
place not only innumerable bodily forms of five different kinds, but also a formative mind.
Such, indeed, is your ignorance or insanity, that you call this mind Hyle, and make it give
forms instead of taking them. If there were such a formative mind as you speak of, and
bodily elements capable of form, the word Hyle would properly be applicable to the bodily
elements, which would be the matter to be formed by the mind, which you make the principle
of evil. Even this would not be a quite accurate use of the word Hyle, which has no form
of any kind; whereas these elements, although capable of new forms, have already the form
of elements, and belong to different kinds. Still this use of the word would not be so much
amiss, notwithstanding your ignorance; for it would thus be applied, as it properly is, to
that which takes form, and not to that which gives it. Even here, however, your folly and
impiety would appear in tracing so much that is good to the evil principle, from your not
knowing that all natures of every kind, all forms in their proportion, and all weights in their
order, can come only from the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. As it is, you know
neither what Hyle is, nor what evil is. Would that I could persuade you to refrain from
misleading people still more ignorant than yourselves!</p>
<p>15. Every one must see the folly of your boasting of superiority to the Pagans because
they use altars and temples, images and sacrifices and incense, in the worship of God, which

<pb n="446"/>
you do not. As if it were not better to build an altar and offer sacrifice to a stone, which has
some kind of existence, than to employ a heated imagination in worshipping things which
have no existence at all. And what do you mean by saying that you are a rational temple of
God? Can that be God’s temple which is partly the construction of the devil? And is this
not true of you, as you say that all your members and your whole body were formed by the
evil principle which you call Hyle, and that part of this formative mind dwells in the body
along with part of your god? And as this part of your god is bound and confined, you should
be called the prison of God rather than his temple. Perhaps it is your soul that is the temple
of God, as you have it from the region of light. But you generally call your soul not a temple,
but a part or member of God. So, when you say you are the temple of God, it must be in
your body, which, you say, was formed by the devil. Thus you blaspheme the temple of
God, calling it not only the workmanship of Satan, but the prison-house of God. The apostle,
on the other hand, says: "The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." And to show
that this refers not merely to the soul, he says expressly: "Know ye not that your bodies are
the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?"742 You call the
workmanship of devils the temple of God, and there, to use Faustus’ words, you place Christ,
the Son of God, the living image of living majesty. Your impiety may well contrive a fabulous
temple for a fabulous Christ. The image you speak of must be so called, because it is the
creature of your imagination.</p>
<p>16. If your mind is an altar, you see whose altar it is. You may see from the very doctrines
and duties in which you say you are trained. You are taught not to give food to a
beggar; and so your altar smokes with the sacrifice of cruelty. Such altars the Lord destroys;
for in words quoted from the law He tells us what offering pleases God: "I desire mercy,
and not sacrifice." Observe on what occasion the Lord uses these words. It was when, in
passing through a field, the disciples plucked the ears of corn because they were hungry.
Your doctrine would lead you to call this murder. Your mind is an altar, not of God, but
of lying devils, by whose doctrines the evil conscience is seared as with a hot iron,743 calling
murder what the truth calls innocence. For in His words to the Jews, Christ by anticipation
deals a fatal blow to you: "If ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,
ye would not have condemned the guiltless."744</p>
<p>17. Nor can you say that you honor God with sacrifices in the shape of pure and simple
prayers: for, in your low, dishonoring notions about the divine nature and substance, you
make your god to be the victim in the sacrifices of Pagans; so far are you from pleasing the
true God with your sacrifices. For you hold that God is confined not only in trees and plants,
<note type="footnote">742 1 Cor. iii. 17, and vi. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">743 1 Tim. iv. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">744 Matt. xii. 7.</note>

<pb n="447"/>
or in the human body, but also in the flesh of animals, which contaminates Him with its
impurity. And how can your soul give praise to God, when you actually reproach Him by
calling your soul a particle of His substance taken captive by the race of darkness; as if God
could not maintain the conflict except by this corruption of His members, and this dishonorable
captivity? Instead of honoring God in your prayers, you insult Him. For what sin
did you commit, when you belonged to Him, that you should be thus punished by the god
you cry to, not because you left Him sinfully of your own choice; for he himself gave you to
His enemies, to obtain peace for His kingdom? You are not even given as hostages to be
honorably guarded. Nor is it as when a shepherd lays a snare to catch a wild beast: for he
does not put one of his own members in the snare, but some animal from his flock; and
generally, so that the wild beast is caught before the animal is hurt. You, though you are
the members of your god, are given to the enemy, whose ferocity you keep off from your
god only by being contaminated with their impurity, infected with their corruptions, without
any fault of your own. You cannot in your prayers use the words: "Free us, O Lord, for the
glory of Thy name; and for Thy name’s sake pardon our sins."745 Your prayer is: "Free us
by Thy skill, for we suffer here oppression, and torture, and pollution, only that Thou
mayest mourn unmolested in Thy kingdom." These are words of reproach, not of entreaty.
Nor can you use the words taught us by the Master of truth: "Forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors."746 For who are the debtors who have sinned against you? If it is the
race of darkness, you do not forgive their debts, but make them be utterly cast out and shut
up in eternal imprisonment. And how can God forgive your debts, when He rather sinned
against you by sending you into such a state, than you against Him, whom you obeyed by
going? If this was not a sin in Him, because He was compelled to do it, this excuse must
apply you, now that you have been overthrown in the conflict, more than to Him before the
conflict began. You suffer now from the mixture of evil, which was not the case with Him
when nevertheless He was compelled to send you. So either He requires that you should
forgive Him his debt; or, if He is not in debt to you, still less are you to Him. It appears that
your sacrifices and your pure and simple prayers are false and vile blasphemies.</p>
<p>18. How is it, by the way, that you use the words temple, altar, sacrifice, for the purpose
of commending your own practices? If such things can be spoken of as properly belonging
to true religion, they must constitute the true worship of the true God. And if there is such
a thing as true sacrifice to the true God, which is implied in the expression divine honors,
there must be some one true sacrifice of which the rest are imitations. On the one hand,
we have the spurious imitations in the case of false and lying gods, that is, of devils, who
proudly demand divine honors from their deluded votaries, as is or was the case in the
<note type="footnote">745 Ps. lxxix. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">746 Matt. vi. 12.</note>

<pb n="448"/>
temples and idols of the Gentiles. On the other hand, we have the prophetic intimations of
one most true sacrifice to be offered for the sins of all believers, as in the sacrifices enjoined
by God on our fathers; along with which there was also the symbolical anointing typical of
Christ, as the name Christ itself means anointed. The animal sacrifices, therefore, presumptuously
claimed by devils, were an imitation of the true sacrifice which is due only to the
one true God, and which Christ alone offered on His altar. Thus the apostle says: "The
sacrifices which the Gentiles offer, they offer to devils, and not to God."747 He does not
find fault with sacrifices, but with offering to devils. The Hebrews, again, in their animal
sacrifices, which they offered to God in many varied forms, suitably to the significance of
the institution, typified the sacrifice offered by Christ. This sacrifice is also commemorated
by Christians, in the sacred offering and participation of the body and blood of Christ. The
Manichæans understand neither the sinfulness of the Gentile sacrifices, nor the importance
of the Hebrew sacrifices, nor the use of the ordinance of the Christian sacrifice. Their own
errors are the offering they present to the devil who has deceived them. And thus they depart
from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and to doctrines of devils, speaking lies in
hypocrisy.</p>
<p>19. It may be well that Faustus, or at least that those who are charmed with Faustus’
writings, should know that the doctrine of a single principle did not come to us from the
Gentiles; for the belief in one true God, from whom every kind of nature is derived, is a part
of the original truth retained among the Gentiles, notwithstanding their having fallen away
to many false gods. For the Gentile philosophers had the knowledge of God, because, as
the apostle says, "the invisible things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that
they are without excuse." But, as the apostle adds, "when they knew God, they glorified Him
not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the
glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds,
and four-footed beasts, and creeping things."748 These are the idols of the Gentiles, which
they cannot explain except by referring to the creatures made by God; so that this very explanation
of their idolatry, on which the more enlightened Gentiles were wont to pride
themselves as a proof of their superiority, shows the truth of the following words of the
apostle: "They worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed
forever."749 Where you differ from the Gentiles, you are in error; where you resemble them,
you are worse than they. You do not believe, as they do, in a single principle; and so you
<note type="footnote">747 1 Cor. x. 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">748 Rom. i. 20-23.</note>
<note type="footnote">749 Rom. i. 25.</note>

<pb n="449"/>
fall into the impiety of believing the substance of the one true God to be liable to subjugation
and corruption. As regards the worship of a plurality of gods, the doctrine of lying devils
has led the Gentiles to worship many idols, and you to worship many phantasms.</p>
<p>20. We do not turn the sacrifices of the Gentiles into love-feasts, as Faustus says we do.
Our love-feasts are rather a substitute for the sacrifice spoken of by the Lord, in the words
already quoted: "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice." At our love-feasts the poor obtain
vegetable or animal food; and so the creature of God is used, as far as it is suitable, for the
nourishment of man, who is also God’s creature. You have been led by lying devils, not in
self-denial, but in blasphemous error, "to abstain from meats which God hath created to be
received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature
of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving."750 In return
for the bounties of the Creator, you ungratefully insult Him with your impiety; and because
in our love-feasts flesh is often given to the poor, you compare Christian charity to Pagan
sacrifices. This indeed, is another point in which you resemble some Pagans. You consider
it a crime to kill animals, because you think that the souls of men pass into them; which is
an idea found in the writings of some Gentile philosophers, although their successors appear
to have thought differently. But here again you are most in error: for they dreaded
slaughtering a relative in the animal; but you dread the slaughter of your god, for you hold
even the souls of animals to be his members.</p>
<p>21. As to our paying honor to the memory of the martyrs, and the accusation of Faustus,
that we worship them instead of idols, I should not care to answer such a charge, were it
not for the sake of showing how Faustus, in his desire to cast reproach on us, has overstepped
the Manichæan inventions, and has fallen heedlessly into a popular notion found in Pagan
poetry, although he is so anxious to be distinguished from the Pagans. For in saying that
we have turned the idols into martyrs, he speaks of our worshipping them with similar rites,
and appeasing the shades of the departed with wine and food. Do you, then, believe in
shades? We never heard you speak of such things, nor have we read of them in your books.
In fact, you generally oppose such ideas: for you tell us that the souls of the dead, if they
are wicked, or not purified, are made to pass through various changes, or suffer punishment
still more severe; while the good souls are placed in ships, and sail through heaven to that
imaginary region of light which they died fighting for. According to you, then, no souls
remain near the burying-place of the body; and how can there be any shades of the departed?
What and where are they? Faustus’ love of evil-speaking has made him forget his own creed;
or perhaps he spoke in his sleep about ghosts, and did not wake up even when he saw his
words in writing. It is true that Christians pay religious honor to the memory of the martyrs,
both to excite us to imitate them and to obtain a share in their merits, and the assistance of
<note type="footnote">750 1 Tim. iv. 3, 4.</note>

<pb n="450"/>
their prayers. But we build altars not to any martyr, but to the God of martyrs, although it
is to the memory of the martyrs. No one officiating at the altar in the saints’ burying-place
ever says, We bring an offering to thee, O Peter! or O Paul! or O Cyprian! The offering is
made to God, who gave the crown of martyrdom, while it is in memory of those thus
crowned. The emotion is increased by the associations of the place, and love is excited both
towards those who are our examples, and towards Him by whose help we may follow such
examples. We regard the martyrs with the same affectionate intimacy that we feel towards
holy men of God in this life, when we know that their hearts are prepared to endure the
same suffering for the truth of the gospel. There is more devotion in our feeling towards
the martyrs, because we know that their conflict is over; and we can speak with greater
confidence in praise of those already victors in heaven, than of those still combating here.
What is properly divine worship, which the Greeks call latria, and for which there is no
word in Latin, both in doctrine and in practice, we give only to God. To this worship belongs
the offering of sacrifices; as we see in the word idolatry, which means the giving of this
worship to idols. Accordingly we never offer, or require any one to offer, sacrifice to a
martyr, or to a holy soul, or to any angel. Any one falling into this error is instructed by
doctrine, either in the way of correction or of caution. For holy beings themselves, whether
saints or angels, refuse to accept what they know to be due to God alone. We see this in
Paul and Barnabas, when the men of Lycaonia wished to sacrifice to them as gods, on account
of the miracles they performed. They rent their clothes, and restrained the people, crying
out to them, and persuading them that they were not gods. We see it also in the angels, as
we read in the Apocalypse that an angel would not allow himself to be worshipped, and said
to his worshipper, "I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethen."751 Those who claim this
worship are proud spirits, the devil and his angels, as we see in all the temples and rites of
the Gentiles. Some proud men, too, have copied their example; as is related of some kings
of Babylon. Thus the holy Daniel was accused and persecuted, because when the king made
a decree that no petition should be made to any god, but only to the king, he was found
worshipping and praying to his own God, that is, the one true God. 752 As for those who
drink to excess at the feasts of the martyrs, we of course condemn their conduct; for to do
so even in their own houses would be contrary to sound doctrine. But we must try to amend
what is bad as well as prescribe what is good, and must of necessity bear for a time with
some things that are not according to our teaching. The rules of Christian conduct are not
to be taken from the indulgences of the intemperate or the infirmities of the weak. Still,
even in this, the guilt of intemperance is much less than that of impiety. To sacrifice to the
martyrs, even fasting, is worse than to go home intoxicated from their feast: to sacrifice to
<note type="footnote">751 Rev. xix. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">752 Dan. vi.</note>

<pb n="451"/>
the martyrs, I say, which is a different thing from sacrificing to God in memory of the
martyrs, as we do constantly, in the manner required since the revelation of the New Testament,
for this belongs to the worship or latria which is due to God alone. But it is vain to
try to make these heretics understand the full meaning of these words of the Psalmist: "He
that offereth the sacrifice of praise glorifieth me, and in this way will I show him my salvation."
753 Before the coming of Christ, the flesh and blood of this sacrifice were foreshadowed
in the animals slain; in the passion of Christ the types were fulfilled by the true sacrifice;
after the ascension of Christ, this sacrifice is commemorated in the sacrament. Between the
sacrifices of the Pagans and of the Hebrews there is all the difference that there is between
a false imitation and a typical anticipation. We do not despise or denounce the virginity of
holy women because there were vestal virgins. And, in the same way, it is no reproach to
the sacrifices of our fathers that the Gentiles also had sacrifices. The difference between the
Christian and vestal virginity is great, yet it consists wholly in the being to whom the vow
is made and paid; and so the difference in the being to whom the sacrifices of the Pagans
and Hebrews are made and offered makes a wide difference between them. In the one case
they are offered to devils, who presumptuously make this claim in order to be held as gods,
because sacrifice is a divine honor. In the other case they are offered to the one true God,
as a type of the true sacrifice, which also was to be offered to Him in the passion of the body
and blood of Christ.</p>
<p>22. Faustus is wrong in saying that our Jewish forefathers, in their separation from the
Gentiles, retained the temple, and sacrifices, and altars, and priesthood, and abandoned
only graven images or idols, for they might have sacrificed, as some do, without any graven
image, to trees and mountains, or even to the sun and moon and the stars. If they had thus
rendered to these objects the worship called latria, they would have served the creature instead
of the Creator, and so would have fallen into the serious error of heathenish superstition;
and even without idols, they would have found devils ready to take advantage of their
error, and to accept their offerings. For these proud and wicked spirits feed not, as some
foolishly suppose, on the smell of the sacrifice, and the smoke, but on the errors of men.
They enjoy not bodily refreshment, but a malevolent gratification, when they in any way
deceive people, or when, with a bold assumption of borrowed majesty, they boast of receiving
divine honors. It was not, therefore, only the idols of the Gentiles that our Jewish forefathers
abandoned. They sacrificed neither to the earth nor to any earthly thing, nor to the sea, nor
to heaven, nor to the hosts of heaven, but laid the victims on the altar of the one God, Creator
of all, who required these offerings as a means of foreshadowing the true victim, by
whom He has reconciled us to Himself in the remission of sins through our Lord Jesus
Christ. So Paul, addressing believers, who are made the body of which Christ is the Head,
<note type="footnote">753 Ps. l. 23.</note>

<pb n="452"/>
says: "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies
a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God."754 The Manichæans, on the other hand, say that
human bodies are the workmanship of the race of darkness, and the prison in which the
captive deity is confined. Thus Faustus’ doctrine is very different from Paul’s. But since
whosover preaches to you another gospel than that ye have received must be accursed, what
Christ says in Paul is the truth, while Manichæus in Faustus is accursed.</p>
<p>23. Faustus says also, without knowing what he says, that we have retained the manners
of the Gentiles. But seeing that the just lives by faith, and that the end of the commandment
is love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned, and that these three,
faith, hope, and love, abide to form the life of believers, it is impossible that there should be
similarity in the manners of those who differ in these three things. Those who believe differently,
and hope differently, and love differently, must also live differently. And if we resemble
the Gentiles in our use of such things as food and drink, and houses and clothes and
baths, and those of us who marry, in taking and keeping wives, and in begetting and bringing
up children as our heirs, there is still a great difference between the man who uses these
things for some end of his own, and the man who, in using them, gives thanks to God,
having no unworthy or erroneous ideas about God. For as you, according to your own
heresy, though you eat the same bread as other men, and live upon the produce of the same
plants and the water of the same fountain, and are clothed like others in wool and linen, yet
lead a different life, not because you eat or drink, or dress differently, but because you differ
from others in your ideas and in your faith, and in all these things have in view an end of
your own—the end, namely, set forth in your false doctrines; in the same way we, though
we resemble the Gentiles in the use of this and other things, do not resemble them in our
life; for while the things are the same, the end is different: for the end we have in view is,
according to the just commandment of God, love out of a pure heart, and a good conscience,
and faith unfeigned; from which some having erred, are turned to vain jangling. In this
vain jangling you bear the palm, for you do not attend to the fact that so great is the difference
of life produced by a different faith, even when the things in possession and use are the
same, that though your followers have wives, and in spite of themselves get children, for
whom they gather and store up wealth; though they eat flesh, drink wine, bathe, reap harvests,
gather vintages, engage in trade, and occupy high official positions, you nevertheless reckon
them as belonging to you, and not to the Gentiles, though in their actions they approach
nearer to the Gentiles than to you. And though some of the Gentiles in some things resemble
you more than your own followers,—those, for instance, who in superstitious devotion abstain
from flesh, and wine, and marriage,—you still count your own followers, even though
they use all these things, and so are unlike you, as belonging to the flock of Manichæus
<note type="footnote">754 Rom. xii. 1.</note>

<pb n="453"/>
rather than those who resemble you in their practices. You consider as belonging to you a
woman that believes in Manichæus, though she is a mother, rather than a Sibyl, though she
never marries. But you will say that many who are called Catholic Christians are adulterers,
robbers, misers, drunkards, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine. I ask if none
such are to be found in your company, which is almost too small to be called a company.
And because there are some among the Pagans who are not of this character, do you consider
them as better than yourselves? And yet, in fact, your heresy is so blasphemous, that even
your followers who are not of such a character are worse than the Pagans who are. It is
therefore no impeachment to sound doctrine, which alone is Catholic, that many wish to
take its name, who will not yield to its beneficial influence. We must bear in mind the true
meaning of the contrast which the Lord makes between the little company and the mass of
mankind, as spread over all the world; for the company of saints and believers is small, as
the amount of grain is small when compared with the heap of chaff; and yet the good grain
is quite sufficient far to outnumber you, good and bad together, for good and bad are both
strangers to the truth. In a word, we are not a schism of the Gentiles, for we differ from
them greatly for the better; nor are you, for you differ from them greatly for the worse.755</p>

<p>Faustus denies that Manichæans believe in two gods. Hyle no god. Augustin discusses at
large the doctrine of God and Hyle, and fixes the charge of dualism upon the Manichæans.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Do we believe in one God or in two? In one, of course. If we are accused
of making two gods, I reply that it cannot be shown that we ever said anything of the kind.
Why do you suspect us of this? Because, you say, you believe in two principles, good and
evil. It is true, we believe in two principles; but one we call God, and the other Hyle, or, to
use common popular language, the devil. If you think this means two gods, you may as well
think that the health and sickness of which doctors speak are two kinds of health, or that
good and evil are two kinds of good, or that wealth and poverty are two kinds of wealth. If
I were describing two things, one white and the other black, or one hot and the other cold,
or one sweet and the other bitter, it would appear like idiocy or insanity in you to say that
I was describing two white things, or two hot things, or two sweet things. So, when I assert
that there are two principles, God and Hyle, you have no reason for saying that I believe in
two gods. Do you think that we must call them both gods because we attribute, as is proper,
all the power of evil to Hyle, and all the power of good to God? If so, you may as well say
that a poison and the antidote must both be called antidotes, because each has a power of
its own, and certain effects follow from the action of both. So also, you may say that a
physician and a poisoner are both physicians; or that a just and an unjust man are both just,
because both do something. If this is absurd, it is still more absurd to say that God and Hyle
must both be gods, because they both produce certain effects. It is a very childish and impotent
way of arguing, when you cannot refute my statements, to make a quarrel about
names. I grant that we, too, sometimes call the hostile nature God; not that we believe it to
be God, but that this name is already adopted by the worshippers of this nature, who in
their error suppose it to be God. Thus the apostle says: "The god of this world has blinded
the minds of them that believe not."756 He calls him God, because he would be so called by
his worshippers; adding that he blinds their minds, to show that he is not the true God.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: You often speak in your discourses of two gods, as indeed you
acknowledge, though at first you denied it. And you give as a reason for thus speaking the
words of the apostle: "The god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe
not." Most of us punctuate this sentence differently, and explain it as meaning that the true
God has blinded the minds of unbelievers. They put a stop after the word God, and read
the following words together. Or without this punctuation you may, for the sake of exposition,
change the order of the words, and read, "In whom God has blinded the minds of
unbelievers of this world," which gives the same sense. The act of blinding the minds of
<note type="footnote">756 2 Cor. iv. 4.</note>

<pb n="455"/>
unbelievers may in one sense be ascribed to God, as the effect not of malice, but of justice.
Thus Paul himself says elsewhere, "Is God unjust, who taketh vengeance?" 757 and again,
"What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For Moses saith,
I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will have compassion on whom I will
have compassion." Observe what he adds, after asserting the undeniable truth that there is
no unrighteousness with God: "But what if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make
His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,
and that He might manifest the riches of His grace towards the vessels of mercy, which
He hath before prepared unto glory?"758 etc. Here it evidently cannot be said that it is one
God who shows his wrath, and makes known his power in the vessels of wrath fitted for
destruction, and another God who shows his riches in the vessels of mercy. According to
the apostle’s doctrine, it is one and the same God who does both. Hence he says again, "For
this cause God gave them up to the lusts of their own heart, to uncleanness, to dishonor
their own bodies between themselves;" and immediately after, "For this cause God gave
them up unto vile affections;" and again, "And even as they did not like to retain God in
their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind."759 Here we see how the true
and just God blinds the minds of unbelievers. For in all these words quoted from the apostle
no other God is understood than He whose Son, sent by Him, came saying, "For judgment
am I come into this world, that they which see not might see, and that they which see might
be made blind."760 Here, again, it is plain to the minds of believers how God blinds the
minds of unbelievers. For among the secret things, which contain the righteous principles
of God’s judgment, there is a secret which determines that the minds of some shall be blinded,
and the minds of some enlightened. Regarding this, it is well said of God, "Thy judgments
are a great deep."761 The apostle, in admiration of the unfathomable depth of this abyss,
exclaims: "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How
unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!"762</p>
<p>3. You cannot distinguish between what God does in mercy and what He does in
judgment, because you can neither understand nor use the words of our Psalter: "I will sing
of mercy and judgment unto Thee, O Lord."763 Accordingly, whatever in the feebleness of
your frail humanity seems amiss to you, you separate entirely from the will and judgment

of God: for you are provided with another evil god, not by a discovery of truth, but by an
invention of folly; and to this god you attribute not only what you do unjustly, but also what
you suffer justly. Thus you assign to God the bestowal of blessings, and take from Him the
infliction of judgments, as if He of whom Christ says that He has prepared everlasting fire
for the wicked were a different being from Him who makes His sun to rise upon the evil
and the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. Why do you not understand
that this great goodness and great severity belong to one God, but because you have not
learned to sing of mercy and judgment? Is not He who causes the sun to rise on the evil
and the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust, the same who also breaks off
the natural branches, and engrafts contrary to nature the wild olive tree? Does not the
apostle, in reference to this, say of this one God: "Thou seest, then, the goodness and
severity of God: to them which were broken off, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou
continue in His goodness?"764 Here it is to be observed how the apostle takes away neither
judicial severity from God, nor free-will from man. It is a profound mystery, impenetrable
by human thought, how God both condemns the ungodly and justifies the ungodly; for both
these things are said of Him in the truth of the Holy Scriptures. But is the mysteriousness
of the divine judgments any reason for taking pleasure in cavilling against them? How much
more becoming, and more suitable to the limitation of our powers, to feel the same awe
which the apostle felt, and to exclaim, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of
the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding
out!" How much better thus to admire what you cannot explain, than to try to make an evil
god in addition to the true God, simply because you cannot understand the one good God!
For it is not a question of names, but of actions.</p>
<p>4. Faustus glibly defends himself by saying, "We speak not of two gods, but of God and
Hyle." But when you ask for the meaning of Hyle, you find that it is in fact another god. If
the Manichæans gave the name of Hyle, as the ancients did, to the unformed matter which
is susceptible of bodily forms, we should not accuse them of making two gods. But it is pure
folly and madness to give to matter the power of forming bodies, or to deny that what has
this power is God. When you give to some other being the power which belongs to the true
God of making the qualities and forms, by which bodies, elements, and animals exist, according
to their respective modes, whatever name you choose to give to this being, you are
chargeable with making another god. There are indeed two errors in this blasphemous
doctrine. In the first place, you ascribe the act of God to a being whom you are ashamed to
call god; though you must call him god as long as you make him do things which only God
can do. In the second place, the good things done by a good God you call bad, and ascribe
to an evil god, because you feel a childish horror of whatever shocks the frailty of fallen hu-
<note type="footnote">764 Rom. xi. 17-24.</note>

<pb n="457"/>
manity, and a childish pleasure in the opposite. So you think snakes are made by an evil
being; while you consider the sun so great a good, that you believe it to be not the creature
of God, but an emission from His substance. You must know that the true God, in whom,
alas, you have not yet come to believe, made both the snake along with the lower creatures,
and the sun along with other exalted creatures. Moreover, among still more exalted creatures,
not heavenly bodies, but spiritual beings, He has made what far surpasses the light of the
sun, and what no carnal man can perceive, much less you, who, in your condemnation of
flesh, condemn the very principle by which you determine good and evil. For your only
idea of evil is from the disagreeableness of some things to the fleshly sense; and your only
idea of good is from sensual gratification.</p>
<p>5. When I consider the things lowest in the scale of nature, which are within our view,
and which, though earthly, and feeble, and mortal, are still the works of God, I am lost in
admiration of the Creator, who is so great, in the great works and no less great in the small.
For the divine skill seen in the formation of all creatures in heaven and earth is always like
itself, even in those things that differ from one another; for it is everywhere perfect, in the
perfection which it gives to everything in its own kind. We see each creature made not as
a whole by itself, but in relation to the rest of the creation; so that the whole divine skill is
displayed in the formation of each, arranging each in its proper place and order, and
providing what is suitable for all, both separately and unitedly. See here, lowest in the scale,
the animals which fly, and swim, and walk, and creep. These are mortal creatures, whose
life, as it is written, "is as a vapor which appeareth for a little time."765 Each of these, according
to the capacity of its kind, contributes the measure appointed in the goodness of the
Creator to the completeness of the whole, so that the lowest partake in the good which the
highest possess in a greater degree. Show me, if you can, any animal, however despicable,
whose soul hates its own flesh, and does not rather nourish and cherish it, by its vital motion
minister to its growth and direct its activity, and exercise a sort of management over a little
universe of its own, which it makes subservient to its own preservation. Even in the discipline
of his own body by a rational being, who brings his body under, that earthly passion may
not hinder his perception of wisdom, there is love for his own flesh, which he then reduces
to obedience, which is its proper condition. Indeed, you yourselves, although your heresy
teaches you a fleshly abhorrence of the flesh, cannot help loving your own flesh, and caring
for its safety and comfort, both by avoiding all injury from blows, and falls, and inclement
weather, and by seeking for the means of keeping it in health. Thus the law of nature is too
strong for your false doctrine.</p>
<p>6. Looking at the flesh itself, do we not see in the construction of its vital parts, in the
symmetry of form, in the position and arrangement of the limbs of action and the organs
<note type="footnote">765 Jas. iv. 15.</note>

<pb n="458"/>
of sensation, all acting in harmony; do we not see in the adjustment of measures, in the
proportion of numbers, in the order of weights, the handiwork of the true God, of whom
it is truly said, "Thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight"? 766 If
your heart was not hardened and corrupted by falsehood, you would understand the invisible
things of God from the things which He has made, even in these feeble creatures of flesh.
For who is the author of the things I have mentioned, but He whose unity is the standard
of all measure, whose wisdom is the model of all beauty, and whose law is the rule of all order?
If you are blind to these things, hear at least the words of the apostle.</p>
<p>7. For the apostle, in speaking of the love which husbands ought to have for their wives
gives, as an example, the love of the soul for the body. The words are: "He that loveth his
wife, loveth himself: for no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth
it, even as Christ the Church."767 Look at the whole animal creation, and you find in the
instinctive self-preservation of every animal this natural principle of love to its own flesh.
It is so not only with men, who, when they live aright, both provide for the safety of their
flesh, and keep their carnal appetites in subjection to the use of reason; the brutes also avoid
pain, and shrink from death, and escape as rapidly as they can from whatever might break
up the construction of their bodies, or dissolve the connection of spirit and flesh; for the
brutes, too, nourish and cherish their own flesh. "For no one ever yet," says the apostle,
"hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ the Church." See
where the apostle begins, and to what he ascends. Consider, if you can, the greatness which
creation derives from its Creator, embracing as it does the whole extent from the host of
heaven down to flesh and blood, with the beauty of manifold form, and the order of successive
gradations.</p>
<p>8. The same apostle again, when speaking of spiritual gifts as diverse, and yet tending
to harmonious action, to illustrate a matter so great, and divine, and mysterious, makes a
comparison with the human body,—thus plainly intimating that this flesh is the handiwork
of God. The whole passage, as found in the Epistle to the Corinthians, is so much to the
point, that though it is long, I think it not amiss to insert it all: "Now concerning spiritual
gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away
unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand, that no
man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed; and that no man can say that Jesus
is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
And there are diversities of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities
of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the
Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of
<note type="footnote">766 Wisd. xi. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">767 Eph. v. 28, 29.</note>

<pb n="459"/>
wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same
Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles;
to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to
another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the self-same
Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will. For as the body is one, and hath many
members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. For the body
is not one member, but many. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye,
I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where
were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? But now hath God
set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased Him. And if they were
all one member, where were the body? But now are they many members, yet but one body.
And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet,
I have no need of you. Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
feeble, are necessary; and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable,
upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant
comeliness. For our comely parts have no need; but God hath tempered the body together,
having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked: that there should be no schism
in the body, but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether
one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the
members rejoice with it."768 Apart altogether from Christian faith, which would lead you
to believe the apostle, if you have common sense to perceive what is self-evident, let each
examine and see for himself the plain truth regarding those things of which the apostle
speaks,—what greatness belongs to the least, and what goodness to the lowest; for these are
the things which the apostle extols, in order to illustrate by means of these common and
visible bodily objects, unseen spiritual realities of the most exalted nature.</p>
<p>9. Whoever, then, denies that our body and its members, which the apostle so approves
and extols, are the handiwork of God, you see whom he contradicts, preaching contrary to
what you have received. So, instead of refuting his opinions, I may leave him to be accursed
of all Christians. The apostle says, God tempered the body. Faustus says, Not God, but
Hyle. Anathemas are more suitable than arguments to such contradictions. You cannot
say that God is here called the God of this world. And if any one understands the passage
where this expression does occur to mean that the devil blinds the minds of unbelievers, we
grant that he does so by his evil suggestions, from yielding to which, men lose the light of
<note type="footnote">768 1 Cor. xii. 1-26.</note>

<pb n="460"/>
righteousness in God’s righteous retribution. This is all in accordance with sacred Scripture.
The apostle himself speaks of temptation from without: "I fear lest, as the serpent beguiled
Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and purity
that is in Christ."769 To the same purpose are the words, "Evil communications corrupt
good manners;"770 and when he speaks of a man deceiving himself, "Whoever thinketh
himself to be anything, when he is nothing, deceiveth himself;"771 or again, in the passage
already quoted of the judgment of God, "God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do
those things which are not convenient."772 Similarly, in the Old Testament, after the words,
"God did not create death, nor hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living," we read,
"By the envy of the devil death entered into the world."773 And again of death, that men
may not put the blame from themselves, "The wicked invite her with hands and voice; and
thinking her a friend, they are drawn down."774 Elsewhere, however, it is said, "Good and
evil, life and death, riches and poverty, are from the Lord God."775 This seems perplexing
to people who do not understand that, apart from the manifest judgment to follow hereafter
upon every evil work, there is an actual judgment at the time; so that in one action, besides
the craft of the deceiver and the wickedness of the voluntary agent, there is also the just
penalty of the judge: for while the devil suggests, and man consents, God abandons. So, if
you join the words, God of this world, and understand that the devil blinds unbelievers by
his mischievous delusions, the meaning is not a bad one. For the word God is not used by
itself, but with the qualification of this world, that is, of wicked men, who seek to prosper
only in this age. In this sense the world is also called evil, where it is written, "that He might
deliver us from this present evil age."776 In the same way, in the expression, "whose god is
their belly," it is only in connection with the word whose that the belly is called god. So also,
in the Psalms, the devils would not be called gods without adding "of the nations."777 But
in the passage we are now considering it is not said, The god of this world, or, Whose god
is their belly, or, The gods of the nations are devils; but simply, God has tempered the body,
which can be understood only of the true God, the Creator of all. There is no disparaging
addition here, as in the other cases. But perhaps Faustus will say that God tempered the

<pb n="461"/>
body, not as the maker of it, in the arrangement of its members, but by mixing His light
with it. Thus Faustus would attribute to some other being than God the construction of the
body, and the arrangement of its members, while God tempered the evil of the construction
by the mixture of His goodness. Such are the inventions with which the Manichæans cram
feeble minds. But God, in aid of the feeble, by the mouth of the sacred writers rebukes this
opinion. For we read a few verses before: "God has placed the members every one of them
in the body, as it has pleased Him." Evidently, God is said to have tempered the body, because
He has constructed it of many members, which in their union preserve the variety of their
respective functions.</p>
<p>10. Do the Manichæans suppose that the animals which, according to their wild notions,
were constructed by Hyle in the race of darkness, had not this harmonious action of their
members, commended by the apostle, before God mixed His light with them; so that then
the head did say to the feet, or the eye to the hand, I have no need of thee? This is not and
cannot be the Manichæan doctrine, for they describe the animals as using all these members,
and speak of them as creeping, walking, swimming, flying, each in its own kind. They could
all see, too, and hear, and use the other senses, and nourish and cherish their own bodies
with appropriate means and appliances. Hence, moreover, they had the power of reproduction,
for they are spoken of as having offspring. All these things, of which Faust speaks
disparagingly as the works of Hyle, could not be done without that harmonious arrangement
which the apostle praises and ascribes to God. Is it not now plain who is to be followed,
and who is to be pronounced accursed? Indeed, the Manichæans tell us of animals that
could speak; and their speeches were heard and understood and approved of by all creatures,
whether creeping things, or quadrupeds, or birds, or fish. Amazing and supernatural eloquence!
Especially as they had no grammarian or elocutionist to teach them, and had not
passed through the painful experience of the cane and the birch. Why, Faustus himself
began late in life to learn oratory, that he might discourse eloquently on these absurdities;
and with all his cleverness, after ruining his health by study, his preaching has gained a mere
handful of followers. What a pity that he was born in the light, and not in that region of
darkness! If he had discoursed there against the light, the whole animal creation, from the
biped to the centipede, from the dragon to the shell-fish, would have listened eagerly, and
obeyed at once; whereas, when he discourses here against the race of darkness, he is oftener
called eloquent than learned, and oftener still a false teacher of the worst kind. And among
the few Manichæans who extol him as a great teacher, he has none of the lower animals as
his disciples; and not even his horse is any the wiser for his master’s instructions, so that
the mixture of a part of deity seems only to make the animals more stupid. What absurdity
is this! When will these deluded beings have the sense to compare the description in the
Manichæan fiction of what the animals were formerly in their own region, with what they
are now in this world? Then their bodies were strong, now they are feeble; then their power

<pb n="462"/>
of vision was such that they were induced to invade the region of God on account of the
beauty which they saw, now it is too weak to face the rays of the sun; then they had intelligence
sufficient to understand a discourse addressed to them, now they have no ability of
the kind; then this astonishing and effective eloquence was natural, now eloquence of the
most meagre kind requires diligent study and preparation. How many good things did the
race of darkness lose by the mixture of good!</p>
<p>11. Faustus has displayed his ingenuity, in the remarks to which I am now replying, by
making for himself a long list of opposites—health and sickness, riches and poverty, white
and black, cold and hot, sweet and bitter. We need not say much about black and white.
Or, if there is a character for good or evil in colors, so that white must be ascribed to God
and black to Hyle; if God threw a white color on the wings of birds, when Hyle, as the
Manichæans say, created them, where had the crows gone to when the swans got whitened?
Nor need we discuss heat and cold, for both are good in moderation, and dangerous in excess.
With regard to the rest, Faustus probably intended that good and evil, which he might
as well have put first, should be understood as including the rest, so that health, riches,
white, hot, sweet, should belong to good; and sickness, poverty, black, cold, bitter, to evil.
The ignorance and folly of this is obvious. It might look like reviling if I were to take up
separately white and black, hot and cold, sweet and bitter, health and sickness. For if white
and sweet are both good, and black and bitter evil, how is it that most grapes and all olives
become black as they become sweet, and so get good by getting evil? And if heat and health
are both good, and cold and sickness evil, why do bodies become sick when heated? Is it
healthy to have fever? But I let these things pass, for they may have been put down hastily,
or they may have been given as merely instances of opposition, and not as being good and
bad, especially as it is nowhere stated that the fire among the race of darkness is cold, so
that heat in this case must unquestionably be evil.</p>
<p>12. We pass on, then, to health, riches, sweetness, which Faustus evidently accounts
good in his contrasts. Was there no health of body in the race of darkness where animals
were born and grew up and brought forth, and had such vitality, that when some that were
with child were taken, as the story is, and were put in bonds in heaven, even the abortive
offspring of a premature birth, falling from heaven to earth, nevertheless lived, and grew,
and produced the innumerable kinds of animals which now exist? Or were there no riches
where trees could grow not only in water and wind, but in smoke and fire, and could bear
such a rich produce, that animals, according to their several kinds, sprang from the fruit,
and were provided with the means of subsistence from those fertile trees, and showed how
well fed they were by a numerous progeny? And all this where there was no toil in cultivation,
and no inclement change from summer to winter, for there was no sun to give variety to
the seasons by his annual course. There must have been perennial productiveness where
the trees were not only born in their own element, but had a supply of appropriate nourish-

<pb n="463"/>
ment to make them constantly fertile; as we see orange-trees bearing fruit all the year round
if they are well watered. The riches must have been abundant, and they must have been
secure from harm; for there could be no fear of hailstorms when there were no lightgatherers
who, in your fable, set the thunder in motion.</p>
<p>13. Nor would the beings in this race of darkness have sought for food if it had not been
sweet and pleasant, so that they would have died from want. For we find that all bodies
have their peculiar wants, according to which food is either agreeable or offensive. If it is
agreeable, it is said to be sweet or pleasant; if it is offensive, it is said to be bitter or sour, or
in some way disagreeable. In human beings we find that one desires food which another
dislikes, from a difference in constitution or habit or state of health. Still more, animals of
quite different make can find pleasure in food which is disagreeable to us. Why else should
the goats feed so eagerly on the wild olives? This food is sweet to them, as in some sicknesses
honey tastes bitter to us. To a thoughtful inquirer these things suggest the beauty of the
arrangement in which each finds what suits it, and the greatness of the good which extends
from the lowest to the highest, and from the material to the spiritual. As for the race of
darkness, if an animal sprung from any element fed on what was produced by that element,
doubtless the food must have been sweet from its appropriateness. Again, if this animal
had found food of another element, the want of appropriateness would have appeared in
its offensiveness to the taste. Such offensiveness is called sourness, or bitterness, or disagreeableness,
or something of the kind; or if its adverse nature is such as to destroy the harmony
of the bodily constitution, and so take away life or reduce the strength, it is called poison,
simply on account of this want of appropriateness, while it may nourish the kind of life to
which it is appropriate. So, if a hawk eat the bread which is our daily food, it dies; and we
die if we eat hellebore, which cattle often feed on, and which may itself in a certain form be
used as a medicine. If Faustus had known or thought of this, he would not have given
poison and antidote as an example of the two natures of good and evil, as if God were the
antidote and Hyle the poison. For the same thing, of one and the same nature, kills or cures,
as it is used appropriately or inappropriately. In the Manichæan legends, their god might
be said to have been poison to the race of darkness; for he so injured their bodies, that from
being strong, they became utterly feeble. But then again, as the light was itself taken, and
subjected to loss and injury, it may be said to have been poison to itself.</p>
<p>14. Instead of one good and one evil principle, you seem to make both good or both
evil, or rather two good and two evil; for they are good in themselves, and evil to one another.
We may see afterwards which is the better or the worse; but meanwhile we may think of
them as both good in themselves. Thus God reigned in one region, while Hyle reigned in
the other. There was health in both kingdoms, and rich produce in both; both had a numerous
progeny, and both tasted the sweetness of pleasures suitable to their respective natures.
But the race of darkness, say the Manichæans, excepting the part which was evil to the light

<pb n="464"/>
which it bordered on, was also evil to itself. As, however, I have already pointed out many
good things in it, if you can point out its evils, there will still be two good kingdoms, though
the one where there are no evils will be the better of the two. What, then, do you call its
evils? They plundered, and killed, and devoured one another, according to Faustus. But if
they did nothing else than this, how could such numerous hosts be born and grow up to
maturity? They must have enjoyed peace and tranquillity too. But, allowing the kingdom
where there is no discord to be the better of the two, still they should both be called good,
rather than one good and the other bad. Thus the better kingdom will be that where they
killed neither themselves nor one another; and the worse, or less good, where, though they
fought with one another, each separate animal preserved its own nature in health and safety.
But we cannot make much difference between your god and the prince of darkness, whom
no one opposed, whose reign was acknowledged by all, and whose proposals were unanimously
agreed to. All this implies great peace and harmony. Those kingdoms are happy
where all agree heartily in obedience to the king. Moreover, the rule of this prince extended
not only to his own species, or to bipeds whom you make the parents of mankind, but to
all kinds of animals, who waited in his presence, obeying his commands, and believing his
declarations. Do you think people are so stupid as not to recognize the attributes of deity
in your description of this prince, or to think it possible that you can have another? If the
authority of this prince rested on his resources, he must have been very powerful; if on his
fame, he must have been renowned; if on love, the regard must have been universal; if on
fear, he must have kept the strictest order. If some evils, then, were mixed with so many
good things, who that knows the meaning of words would call this the nature of evil? Besides,
if you call this the nature of evil, because it was not only evil to the other nature, but was
also evil in itself, was there no evil, think you, in the dire necessity to which your god was
subjected before the mixture with the opposite nature, so that he was compelled to fight
with it, and to send his own members to be swallowed up so mercilessly as to be beyond the
hope of complete recovery? This was a great evil in that nature before its mixture with the
only thing you allow to be evil. Your god must either have had it in his power not to be injured
and sullied by the race of darkness, in which case his own folly must have brought
him into trouble; or if his substance was liable to corruption, the object of your worship is
not the incorruptible God of whom the apostle speaks. 778 Does not, then this liability to
corruption, even apart from the actual experience, seem to you to be an evil in your god?</p>
<p>15. It is plain, moreover, that either he must have been destitute of prescience,—a great
defect, surely, in the Deity, not to know what is coming; or if he had prescience, he can
never have felt secure, but must have been in constant terror, which you must allow to be
a serious evil. There must have been the fear at every moment, that the time might be come
<note type="footnote">778 1 Tim. i. 17.</note>

<pb n="465"/>
for that conflict in which his members suffered such loss and contamination, that to liberate
and purify them costs infinite labor, and, after all, can be done only partially. If it is going
too far to attribute this state of alarm to the Deity himself, his members at least must have
dreaded the prospect of suffering all these evils. Then, again, if they were ignorant of what
was to happen, the substance of your god must have been so far wanting in prescience. How
many evils do you reckon in your chief good? Perhaps you will say that they had no fear,
because they foresaw, along with the suffering, their liberation and triumph. But still they
must have feared for their companions, if they knew that they were to be cut off from their
kingdom, and bound for ever in the mass of darkness.</p>
<p>16. Had they not the charity to feel a kindly sympathy for those who were doomed to
suffer eternal punishment, without having committed any sin? These souls that were to be
bound up with the mass, were not they too part of your god? Were they not of the same
origin, the same substance? They at least must have felt grief or fear in the prospect of their
own eternal bondage. To say that they did not know what was to happen, while the others
did, is to make one and the same substance partly acquainted with the future, and partly
ignorant. How can you call this substance the pure, and perfect, and supreme good, if there
were such evils in it, even before its mixture with the evil principle? You will have to confess
your two principles either both good or both evil. If you make two evils, you may make
either of them the worse, as you please. But if you make two goods, we shall have to inquire
which you make the better. Meanwhile there is an end to your doctrine of two principles,
one good and the other evil, which are in fact two gods, one good and the other evil. But if
hurting another is evil, they both hurt one another. Perhaps the greater evil was in the
principle that first began the attack. But if one began the injury, the other returned it; and
not by the law of compensation, an eye for an eye, which you are foolish enough to find
fault with, but with far greater severity. You must choose which you will call the worse,—the
one that began the injury, or the one that had the will and the power to do still greater injury.
The one tried to get a share in the enjoyment of light; the other effected the entire overthrow
of its opponent. If the one had got what it desired, it would certainly have done no harm
to itself. But the other, in the discomfiture of its adversary, did great mischief to part of itself;
reminding us of the well-known passionate exclamation, which is on record as having been
actually used, "Perish our friends, if that will rid us of our enemies."779 For part of your god
was sent to suffer hopeless contamination, that there might be a covering for the mass in
which the enemy is to be buried for ever alive. So much will he continue to be dreaded even
when conquered and bound, that the security, such as it is, of one part of the deity must be
purchased by the eternal misery of the other parts. Such is the harmlessness of the good
principle! Your god, it appears, is guilty of the crime with which you charge the race of
<note type="footnote">779 Quoted Cic. pro Dejor. § 9.</note>

<pb n="466"/>
darkness—of injuring both friends and enemies. The charge is proved in the case of your
god, by that final mass in which his enemies are confined, while his own subjects are involved
in it. In fact, the principle that you call god is the more injurious of the two, both to friends
and to enemies. In the case of Hyle, there was no desire to destroy the opposite kingdom,
but only to possess it; and though some of its subjects were put to death by the violence of
others, they appeared again in other forms, so that in the alternation of life and death they
had intervals of enjoyment in their history. But your god, with all the omnipotence and
perfect excellence that you ascribe to him, dooms his enemies to eternal destruction, and
his friends to eternal punishment. And the height of insanity is in believing that while internal
contest occasions the injury of the members of Hyle, victory brings punishment to
the members of God. What means this folly? To use Faustus’ comparison of God and Hyle
to the antidote and poison, the antidote seems to be more mischievous than the poison.
We do not hear of Hyle shutting up God for ever in a mass of darkness, or driving its own
members into it; or, which is worst of all, slandering this unfortunate remnant, as an excuse
for not effecting its purification. For Manichæus, in his Fundamental Epistle, says that these
souls deserved to be thus punished, because they allowed themselves to be led away from
their original brightness, and became enemies of holy light; whereas it was God himself that
sent them to lose themselves in the region of darkness, that light might be opposed to light:
which was unjust, if he forced them against their will; while, if they went willingly, he is
ungrateful in punishing them. These souls can never have been happy, if they were tormented
with fear before the conflict, from knowing that they were to become enemies to their original
principle, and then in the conflict were hopelessly contaminated, and afterwards
eternally condemned. On the other hand, they can never have been divine, if before the
conflict they were unaware of what was coming, from want of prescience, and then showed
feebleness in the conflict, and suffered misery afterwards. And what is true of them must
be true of God, since they are of the same substance. Is there any hope of your seeing the
folly of these blasphemies? You attempt, indeed, to vindicate the goodness of God, by asserting
that Hyle when shut up is prevented from doing any more injury to itself. Hyle, it
seems, is to get some good, when it has no longer any good mixed with it. Perhaps, as God
before the conflict had the evil of necessity, when the good was unmixed with evil, so Hyle
after the conflict is to have the good of rest, when the evil is unmixed with good. Your
principles are thus either two evils, one worse than the other; or two goods, both imperfect,
but one better than the other. The better, however, is the more miserable; for if the issue of
this great conflict is that the enemy gets some good by the cessation of mutual injuries in
Hyle, while God’s own subjects suffer the serious evil of being driven into the mass of
darkness, we may ask who has got the victory. The poison, we are to understand, is Hyle,
where, nevertheless, animal life found a plentiful supply of the means of growth and productiveness;
while the antidote is God, who could condemn his own members, but could

<pb n="467"/>
not restore them. In reality, it is as absurd to call the one Hyle, as it is to call the other God.
These are the follies of men who turn to fables because they cannot bear sound doctrine.780</p>

<head>Book XXII.</head>
<p>Faustus states his objections to the morality of the law and the prophets, and Augustin seeks
by the application of the type and the allegory to explain away the moral difficulties of
the Old Testament.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You ask why we blaspheme the law and the prophets. We are so far
from professing or feeling any hostility to the law and the prophets, that we are ready, if you
will allow us, to declare the falsehood of all the writings which make the law and the
prophets appear objectionable. But this you refuse to admit, and by maintaining the authority
of your writers, you bring a perhaps unmerited reproach upon the prophets; you slander
the patriarchs, and dishonor the law. You are so unreasonable as to deny that your writers
are false, while you uphold the piety and sanctity of those who are described in these writings
as guilty of the worst crimes, and as leading wicked lives. These opinions are inconsistent;
for either these were bad characters, or the writers were untruthful.</p>
<p>2. Supposing, then, that we agree in condemning the writers, we may succeed in vindicating
the law and the prophets. By the law must be understood not circumcision, or Sabbaths,
or sacrifices, or the other Jewish observances, but the true law, viz., Thou shall not kill, Thou
shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not bear false witness, and so on. To this law, promulgated
throughout the world, that is, at the commencement of the present constitution
of the world, the Hebrew writers did violence, by infecting it with the pollution of their
disgusting precepts about circumcision and sacrifice. As a friend of the law, you should
join with me in condemning the Jews for injuring the law by this mixture of unsuitable
precepts. Plainly, you must be aware that these precepts are not the law, or any part of the
law, since you claim to be righteous, though you make no attempt to keep the precepts. In
seeking to lead a righteous life, you pay great regard to the commandments which forbid
sinful actions, while you take no notice of the Jewish observances; which would be unjustifiable
if they were one and the same law. You resent as a foul reproach being called negligent
of the precept, "Thou shalt not kill," or "Thou shall not commit adultery." And if you showed
the same resentment at being called uncircumcised, or negligent of the Sabbath, it would
be evident that you considered both to be the law and the commandment of God. In fact,
however, you consider the honor and glory of keeping the one no way endangered by disregard
of the other. It is plain, as I have said, that these observances are not the law, but a
disfigurement of the law. If we condemn them, it is not as being genuine, but as spurious.
In this condemnation there is no reproach of the law, or of God its author, but only of those
who published their shocking superstitions under these names. If we sometimes abuse the
venerable name of law in attacking the Jewish precepts, the fault is yours, for refusing to
distinguish between Hebrew observances and the law. Only restore to the law its proper
dignity, by removing these foul Israelitish blots; grant that these writers are guilty of disfig-

<pb n="469"/>
uring the law, and you will see at once that we are the enemies not of the law, but of Judaism.
You are misled by the word law; for you do not know to what that name properly belongs.</p>
<p>3. For my part, I see no reason for your thinking that we blaspheme your prophets and
patriarchs. There would indeed be some ground for the charge, if we had been directly or
remotely the authors of the account given of their actions. But as this account is written
either by themselves, in a criminal desire to be famous for their misdeeds, or by their companions
and coevals, why should you blame us? You condemn them in abhorrence of the
wicked actions of which they have voluntarily declared themselves guilty, though there was
no occasion for such a confession. Or if the narrative is only a malicious fiction, let its authors
be punished, let the books be condemned, let the prophetic name be cleared from this foul
reproach, let the patriarchs recover the respect due to their simplicity and purity of managers.</p>
<p>4. These books, moreover, contain shocking calumnies against God himself. We are
told that he existed from eternity in darkness, and admired the light when he saw it; that he
was so ignorant of the future, that he gave Adam a command, not foreseeing that it would
be broken; that his perception was so limited that he could not see Adam when, from the
knowledge of his nakedness, he hid himself in a corner of Paradise; that envy made him
afraid lest his creature man should taste of the tree of life, and live for ever; that afterwards
he was greedy for blood, and fat from all kinds of sacrifices, and jealous if they were offered
to any one but himself; that he was enraged sometimes against his enemies, sometimes
against his friends; that he destroyed thousands of men for a slight offense, or for nothing;
that he threatened to come with a sword and spare nobody, righteous or wicked. The authors
of such bold libels against God might very well slander the men of God. You must join with
us in laying the blame on the writers if you wish to vindicate the prophets.</p>
<p>5. Again, we are not responsible for what is said of Abraham, that in his irrational
craving to have children, and not believing God, who promised that his wife Sara should
have a son, he defiled himself with a mistress, with the knowledge of his wife, which only
made it worse;781 or that, in sacrilegious profanation of his marriage, he on different occasions,
from avarice and greed, sold his wife Sara for the gratification of the kings Abimelech
and Pharas, telling them that she was his sister, because she was very fair.782 The narrative
is not ours, which tells how Lot, Abraham’s brother, after his escape from Sodom, lay with
his two daughters on the mountain783 (better for him to have perished in the conflagration
of Sodom, than to have burned with incestuous passion); or how Isaac imitated his father’s
conduct, and called his wife Rebecca his sister, that he might gain a shameful livelihood by
her;784 or how his son Jacob, husband of four wives—two full sisters, Rachel and Leah, and

<pb n="470"/>
their handmaids—led the life of a goat among them, so that there was a daily strife among
his women who should be the first to lay hold of him when he came from the field, ending
sometimes in their hiring him from one another for the night;785 or, again, how his son
Judah slept with his daughter-in-law Tamar, after she had been married to two of his sons,
deceived, we are told, by the harlot’s dress which Tamar put on, knowing that her father-
in-law was in the habit of associating with such characters;786 or how David, after having a
number of wives, seduced the wife of his soldier Uriah, and caused Uriah himself to be killed
in the battle;787 or how his son Solomon had three hundred wives, and seven hundred
concubines, and princesses without number;788 or how the first prophet Hosea got children
from a prostitute, and, what is worse, it is said that this disgraceful conduct was enjoined
by God;789 or how Moses committed murder,790 and plundered Egypt,791 and waged wars,
and commanded, or himself perpetrated, many cruelties.792 And he too was not content
with one wife. We are neither directly nor remotely the authors of these and similar narratives,
which are found in the books of the patriarchs and the prophets. Either your writers
forged these things, or the fathers are really guilty. Choose which you please; the crime in
either case is detestable, for vicious conduct and falsehood are equally hateful.</p>
<p>6. Augustin replied: You understand neither the symbols of the law nor the acts of the
prophets, because you do not know what holiness or righteousness means. We have repeatedly
shown at great length, that the precepts and symbols of the Old Testament contained
both what was to be fulfilled in obedience through the grace bestowed in the New Testament,
and what was to be set aside as a proof of its having been fulfilled in the truth now made
manifest. For in the love of God and of our neighbor is secured the accomplishment of the
precepts of the law, while the accomplishment of its promises is shown in the abolition of
circumcision, and of other typical observances formerly practised. By the precept men were
led, through a sense of guilt to desire salvation; by the promise they were led to find in the
typical observances the assurance that the Saviour would come. The salvation desired was
to be obtained through the grace bestowed on the appearance of the New Testament; and
the fulfillment of the expectation rendered the types no longer necessary. The same law
that was given by Moses became grace and truth in Jesus Christ. By the grace in the pardon

<pb n="471"/>
of sin, the precept is kept in force in the case of those supported by divine help. By the truth
the symbolic rites are set aside, that the promise might, in those who trust in the divine
faithfulness, be brought to pass.</p>
<p>7. Those, accordingly, who, finding fault with what they do not understand, call the
typical institutions of the law disfigurements and excrescences, are like men displeased with
things of which they do not know the use. As if a deaf man, seeing others move their lips
in speaking, were to find fault with the motion of the mouth as needless and unsightly; or
as if a blind man, on hearing a house commended, were to test the truth of what he heard
by passing his hand over the surface of the wall, and on coming to the windows were to cry
out against them as flaws in the level, or were to suppose that the wall had fallen in.</p>
<p>8. How shall I make those whose minds are full of vanity understand that the actions
of the prophets were also mystical and prophetic? The vanity of their minds is shown in
their thinking that we believe God to have once existed in darkness, because it is written,
"Darkness was over the deep."793 As if we called the deep God, where there was darkness,
because the light did not exist there before God made it by His word. From their not distinguishing
between the light which is God, and the light which God made, they imagine that
God must have been in darkness before He made light, because darkness was over the deep
before God said, "Let there be light, and there was light." In the New Testament both these
things are ascribed to God. For we read, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all;"794
and again, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our
hearts."795 So also, in the Old Testament, the name "Brightness of eternal light"796 is given
to the wisdom of God, which certainly was not created, for by it all things were made; and
of the light which exists only as the production of this wisdom it is said, "Thou wilt light my
candle, O Lord; my God, Thou wilt enlighten my darkness."797 In the same way, in the beginning,
when darkness was over the deep, God said, "Let there be light, and there was light,"
which only the light-giving light, which is God Himself, could have made.</p>
<p>9. For as God is His own eternal happiness, and is besides the bestower of happiness,
so He is His own eternal light, and is also the bestower of light. He envies the good of none,
for He is Himself the source of happiness to all good beings; He fears the evil of none, for
the loss of all evil beings is in their being abandoned by Him. He can neither be benefited
by those on whom He Himself bestows happiness, nor is He afraid of those whose misery
is the doom awarded by His own judgment. Very different, O Manichæus, is the object of
<note type="footnote">793 Gen. i. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">794 1 John i. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">795 2 Cor. iv. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">796 Wisd. vii. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">797 Ps. xviii. 28.</note>

<pb n="472"/>
your worship. You have departed from God in the pursuit of your own fancies, which of all
kinds have increased and multiplied in your foolish roving hearts, drinking in through the
sense of sight the light of the heavenly bodies. This light, though it too is made by God, is
not to be compared to the light created in the minds of the pious, whom God brings out of
darkness into light, as He brings them out of sinfulness into righteousness. Still less can it
be compared to that inaccessible light from which all kinds of light are derived. Nor is this
light inaccessible to all; for "blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."798 "God
is light, and in Him is no darkness at all;" but the wicked shall not see light, as is said in
Isaiah.799 To them the light-giving light is inaccessible. From the light comes not only the
spiritual light in the minds of the pious, but also the material light, which is not denied to
the wicked, but is made to rise on the evil and on the good.</p>
<p>10. So, when darkness was over the deep, He who was light said, "Let there be light."
From what light this light came is clear; for the words are, "God said." What light is that
which was made, is not so clear. For there has been a friendly discussion among students
of the sacred Scriptures, whether God then made the light in the minds of the angels, or, in
other words, these rational spirits themselves, or some material light which exists in the
higher regions of the universe beyond our ken. For on the fourth day He made the visible
luminaries of heaven. And it is also a question whether these bodies were made at the same
time as their light, or were somehow kindled from the light made already. But whoever
reads the sacred writings in the pious spirit which is required to understand them, must be
convinced that whatever the light was which was made when, at the time that darkness was
over the deep, God said, "Let there be light," it was created light, and the creating Light was
the maker of it.</p>
<p>11. Nor does it follow that God, before He made light, abode in darkness, because it is
said that darkness was over the deep, and then that the Spirit of God moved on the waters.
The deep is the unfathomable abyss of the waters. And the carnal mind might suppose that
the Spirit abode in the darkness which was over the deep, because it is said that He moved
on the waters. This is from not understanding how the light shineth in darkness, and the
darkness comprehendeth it not, till by the word of God those who were darkness are made
light, and it is said to them, "Ye were once darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord."800
But if rational minds which are in darkness through a sinful will cannot comprehend the
light of the wisdom of God, though it is present everywhere, because they are separated
from it not in place, but in disposition: why may not the Spirit of God have moved on the
<note type="footnote">798 Matt. v. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">799 Isa. viii. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">800 Eph. v. 8.</note>

<pb n="473"/>
darkness of the waters, when He moved on the waters, though at an immeasurable distance
from it, not in place, but in nature?</p>
<p>12. In all this I know I am singing to deaf ears; but the Lord, from whom is the truth
which we speak, can open some ears to catch the strain. But what shall we say of those
critics of the Holy Scriptures who object to God’s being pleased with His own works, and
find fault with the words, "God saw the light that it was good," as if this meant that God
admired the light as something new? God’s seeing His works that they were good, means
that the Creator approved of His own works as pleasing to Himself. For God cannot be
forced to do anything against His will, so that He should not be pleased with His own work;
nor can He do anything by mistake, so that He should regret having done it. Why should
the Manichæans object to our God seeing His work that it was good, when their god placed
a covering before himself when he mingled his own members with the darkness? For instead
of seeing his work that it is good, he refuses to look at it because it is evil.</p>
<p>13. Faustus speaks of our God as astonished, which is not said in Scripture; nor does it
follow that one must be astonished when he sees anything to be good. There are many good
things which we see without being astonished, as if they were better than we expected; we
merely approve of them as being what they ought to be. We can, however, give an instance
of God being astonished, not from the Old Testament, which the Manichæans assail with
undeserved reproach, but from the New Testament, which they profess to believe in order
to entrap the unwary. For they acknowledge Christ as God, and use this as a bait to entice
Christ’s followers into their snares. God, then, was astonished when Christ was astonished.
For we read in the Gospel, that when Christ heard the faith of a certain centurion, He was
astonished, and said to His disciples, "Verily I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
801 We have already given our explanation of the words, "God saw that it was good."
Better men may give a better explanation. Meanwhile let the Manichæans explain Christ’s
being astonished at what He foresaw before it happened, and knew before He heard it. For
though seeing a thing to be good is quite different from being astonished at it, in this case
there is some resemblance, for Jesus was astonished at the light of faith which He Himself
had created in the heart of the centurion; for Jesus is the true light, which enlighteneth every
man that cometh into the world.</p>
<p>14. Thus an irreligious Pagan might bring the same reproaches against Christ in the
Gospel, as Faustus brings against God in the Old Testament. He might say that Christ lacked
foresight, not only because He was astonished at the faith of the centurion, but because He
chose Judas as a disciple who proved disobedient to His commands; as Faustus objects to
the precept given in Paradise, which, as it turned out, was not obeyed. He might also cavil
at Christ’s not knowing who touched Him, when the woman suffering from an issue of
<note type="footnote">801 Matt. viii. 10.</note>

<pb n="474"/>
blood touched the hem of His garment; as Faustus blames God for not knowing where Adam
had hid himself. If this ignorance is implied in God’s saying, "Where art thou, Adam?"802
the same may be said of Christ’s asking, "Who touched me?"803 The Pagans also might call
Christ timid and envious, in not wishing five of the ten virgins to gain eternal life by entering
into His kingdom, and in shutting them out, so that they knocked in vain in their entreaty
to have the door opened, as if forgetful of His own promise, "Knock, and it shall be opened
unto you;"804 as Faustus charges God with fear and envy in not admitting man after his sin
to eternal life. Again, he might call Christ greedy of the blood, not of beasts, but of men,
because he said, "He that loseth his life for my sake, shall keep it unto life eternal;"805 as
Faustus reproaches God in reference to those animal sacrifices which prefigured the sacrifice
of blood-shedding by which we are redeemed. He might also accuse Christ of jealousy, because
in narrating His driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple, the evangelist quotes
as applicable to Him the words, "The jealousy of Thine house hath eaten me up;"806 as
Faustus accuses God of jealousy in forbidding sacrifices to be offered to other gods. He
might say that Christ was angry with both His friends and His enemies: with His friends,
because He said, "The servant that knows his lord’s will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten
with many stripes;" and with His enemies, because He said, "If any one shall not receive you,
shake off against him the dust of your shoes; verily I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable
for Sodom in the day of judgment than for that city;"807 as Faustus accuses God of
being angry at one time with His friends, and at another with His enemies; both of whom
are spoken of thus by the apostle: "They that have sinned without law shall perish without
law, and they that have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law."808 Or he might say
that Christ shed the blood of many without mercy, for a slight offense or for nothing. For
to a Pagan there would appear to be little or no harm in not having a wedding garment at
the marriage feast, for which our King in the Gospel commanded a man to be bound hand
and foot, and cast into outer darkness;809 or in not wishing to have Christ for a king, which
is the sin of which Christ says, "Those that would not have me to reign over them, bring
hither and slay before me;"810 as Faustus blames God in the Old Testament for slaughtering

<pb n="475"/>
thousands of human beings for slight offenses, as Faustus calls them, or for nothing. Again,
if Faustus finds fault with God’s threatening to come with the sword, and to spare neither
the righteous nor the wicked, might not the Pagan find as much fault with the words of the
Apostle Paul, when he says of our God," He spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for
us all;"811 or of Peter, when, in exhorting the saints to be patient in the midst of persecution
and slaughter, he says, "It is time that judgment begin from the house of God; and if it first
begin at us, what shall the end be of them that believe not the gospel of the Lord? And if
the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?"812 What can
be more righteous than the Only-Begotten, whom nevertheless the Father did not spare?
And what can be plainer than that the righteous also are not spared, but chastised with
manifold afflictions, as is clearly implied in the words, "If the righteous scarcely are saved"?
As it is said in the Old Testament, "Whom the Lord loveth He correcteth, and chastiseth
every son whom He receiveth;"813 and, "If we receive good at the hand of the Lord, shall we
not also receive evil?"814 So we read also in the New Testament, "Whom I love I rebuke and
chasten;"815 and, "If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged of the Lord; but when we
are judged, we are corrected of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."816
If a Pagan were to make such objections to the New Testament, would not the Manichæans
try to answer them, though they themselves make similar objections to the Old Testament?
But supposing them able to answer the Pagan, how absurd it would be to defend in the one
Testament what they find fault with in the other! But if they could not answer the objections
of the Pagan, why should they not allow in both Testaments, instead of in one only, that
what appears wrong to unbelievers, from their ignorance, should be believed to be right by
pious readers even when they also are ignorant?</p>
<p>15. Perhaps our opponents will maintain that these parallel passages quoted from the
New Testament are themselves neither authoritative nor true: for they claim the impious
liberty of holding and teaching, that whatever they deem favorable to their heresy was said
by Christ and the apostles; while they have the profane boldness to say, that whatever in the
same writings is unfavorable to them is a spurious interpolation. I have already at some
length, as far as the intention of the present work required, exposed the unreasonableness
of this assault upon the authority of the whole of Scripture.</p>
<note type="footnote">811 Rom. viii. 32.</note>

<pb n="476"/>
<p>16. At present I would call attention to the fact, that when the Manichæans, although
they disguise their blasphemous absurdities under the name of Christianity, bring such objections
against the Christian Scriptures, we have to defend the authority of the divine record
in both Testaments against the Manichæans as much as against the Pagans. A Pagan might
find fault with passages in the New Testament in the same way as Faustus does with what
he calls unworthy representations of God in the Old Testament; and the Pagan might be
answered by the quotation of similar passages from his own authors, as in Paul’s speech at
Athens.817 Even in Pagan writings we might find the doctrine that God created and constructed
the world, and that He is the giver of light, which does not imply that before light
was made He abode in darkness; and that when His work was finished He was elated with
joy, which is more than saying that He saw that it was good; and that He made a law with
rewards for obedience, and punishments for disobedience, by which they do not mean to
say that God was ignorant of the future, because He gave a law to those by whom it was to
be broken. Nor could they make asking questions a proof of a want of foresight even in a
human being; for in their books many questions are asked only for the purpose of using the
answers for the conviction of the persons addressed: for the questioner knows not only
what answer he desires, but what will actually be given. Again, if the Pagan tried to make
out God to be envious of any one, because He will not give happiness to the wicked, he
would find many passages in the writings of his own authors in support of this principle of
the divine government.</p>
<p>17. The only objection that a Pagan would make on the subject of sacrifice would refer
to our reason for finding fault with Pagan sacrifices, when in the Old Testament God is described
as requiring men to offer sacrifice to Him. If I were to reply at length on this subject,
I might prove to him that sacrifice is due only to the one true God, and that this sacrifice
was offered by the one true Priest, the Mediator of God and man; and that it was proper
that this sacrifice should be pre-figured by animal sacrifices, in order to foreshadow the
flesh and blood of the one sacrifice for the remission of sins contracted by flesh and blood,
which shall not inherit the kingdom of God: for the natural body will be endowed with
heavenly attributes, as the fire in the sacrifice typified the swallowing up of death in victory.
Those observances properly belonged to the people whose kingdom and priesthood were
prophetic of the King and Priest who should come to govern and to consecrate believers in
all nations, and to lead them into the kingdom of heaven, and the holy society of angels and
eternal life. And as this true sacrifice was piously set forth in the Hebrew observances, so
it was impiously caricatured by the Pagans, because, as the apostle says, what they offer they
offer to devils, and not to God.818 The typical rite of blood-shedding in sacrifice dates from
<note type="footnote">817 Acts xvii. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">818 1 Cor. x. 20.</note>

<pb n="477"/>
the earliest ages, pointing forward from the outset of human history to the passion of the
Mediator. For Abel is mentioned in the sacred Scripture as the first who offered such sacrifices.
819 We need not therefore wonder that fallen angels who occupy the air, and whose
chief sins are pride and falsehood, should demand from their worshippers by whom they
wished to be considered as gods what they knew to be due to God only. This deception was
favored by the folly of the human heart, especially when regret for the dead led to the making
of likenesses, and so to the use of images.820 By the increase of this homage, divine honors
came to be paid to the dead as dwelling in heaven, while devils took their place on earth as
the objects of worship, and required that their deluded and degraded votaries should present
sacrifices to them. Thus the nature of sacrifice as due only to God appears not only when
God righteously claims it, but also when a false god proudly arrogates it. If the Pagan was
slow to believe these things, I should argue from the prophecies, and point out that, though
uttered long ago, they are now fulfilled. If he still remained in unbelief, this is rather to be
expected than to be wondered at; for the prophecy itself intimates that all would not believe.</p>
<p>18. If the Pagan, in the next place, were to find fault with both Testaments as attributing
jealousy to God and Christ, he would only show his own ignorance of literature, or his forgetfulness.
For though their philosophers distinguish between desire and passion, joy and
gratification, caution and fear, gentleness and tender-heartedness, prudence and cunning,
boldness and daring, and so on, giving the first name in each pair to what is good, and the
second to what is bad, their books are notwithstanding full of instances in which, by the
abuse of these words, virtues are called by the names which properly belong to vices; as
passion is used for desire, gratification for joy, fear for caution, tender-heartedness for
gentleness, cunning for prudence, daring for boldness. The cases are innumerable in which
speech exhibits similar inaccuracies. Moreover, each language has its own idioms. For in
religious writings I remember no instance of the word tender-heartedness being used in a
bad sense. And common usage affords examples of similar peculiarities in the use of words.
In Greek, one word stands for two distinct things, labor and pain; while we have a separate
name for each. Again, we use the word in two senses, as when we say of what is not dead,
that it has life; and again, of any one that he is a man of good life, whereas in Greek each of
these meanings has a word of its own. So that, apart from the abuse of words which prevails
in all languages, it may be an Hebrew idiom to use jealousy in two senses, as a man is called
jealous when he suffers from a diseased state of mind caused by distress on account of the
faithlessness of his wife, in which sense the word cannot be applied to God; or as when diligence
is manifested in guarding conjugal chastity, in which sense it is profitable for us not
only unhesitatingly to admit, but thankfully to assert, that God is jealous of His people when
<note type="footnote">819 Gen. iv. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">820 Wisd. xiv. 15.</note>

<pb n="478"/>
He calls them His wife, and warns them against committing adultery with a multitude of
false gods. The same may be said of the anger of God. For God does not suffer perturbation
when He visits men in anger; but either by an abuse of the word, or by a peculiarity of idiom,
anger is used in the sense of punishment.</p>
<p>19. The slaughter of multitudes would not seem strange to the Pagan, unless he denied
the judgment of God, which Pagans do not; for they allow that all things in the universe,
from the highest to the lowest, are governed by God’s providence. But if he would not allow
this, he would be convinced either by the authority of Pagan writers, or by the more tedious
method of demonstration; and if still obstinate and perverse, he would be left to the judgment
which he denies. Then, if he were to give instances of the destruction of men for no offense,
or for a very slight one, we should show that these were offenses, and that they were not
slight. For instance, to take the case already referred to of the wedding garment, we should
prove that it was a great crime in a man to attend the sacred feast, seeking not the bridegroom’s
glory, but his own, or whatever the garment may be found on better interpretation
to signify. And in the case of the slaughter before the king of those who would not have
him to reign over them, we might perhaps easily prove that, though it may be no sin in a
man to refuse to obey his fellow-man, it is both a fault and a great one to reject the reign of
Him in whose reign alone is there righteousness, and happiness, and continuance.</p>
<p>20. Lastly, as regards Faustus’ crafty insinuation, that the Old Testament misrepresents
God as threatening to come with a sword which will spare neither the righteous nor the
wicked, if the words were explained to the Pagan, he would perhaps disagree neither with
the Old Testament nor with the New; and he might see the beauty of the parable in the
Gospel, which people who pretend to be Christians either misunderstand from their blindness,
or reject from their perversity. The great husbandman of the vine uses his pruninghook
differently in the fruitful and in the unfruitful branches; yet he spares neither good
nor bad, pruning one and cutting off the other.821 There is no man so just as not to require
to be tried by affliction to advance, or to establish, or to prove his virtue. Do the Manichæans
not reckon Paul as righteous, who, while confessing humbly and honestly his past sins, still
gives thanks for being justified by faith in Jesus Christ? Was Paul then spared by Him whom
fools misunderstand, when He says, "I will spare neither the righteous nor the sinner"? Hear
the apostle himself: "Lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation,
there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me. For this
I besought the Lord thrice, that He would remove it from me; and He said unto me, My
grace is sufficient for thee: for strength is perfected in weakness."822 Here a just man is not
spared that his strength might be perfected in weakness by Him who had given him an angel
<note type="footnote">821 John xv. 1-3.</note>
<note type="footnote">822 2 Cor. xii. 7-9.</note>

<pb n="479"/>
of Satan to buffet him. If you say that the devil gave this angel, it follows that the devil sought
to prevent Paul’s being exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation, and to
perfect his strength. This is impossible. Therefore He who gave up this righteous man to
be buffeted by the messenger of Satan, is the same as He who, through Paul, gave up to Satan
himself the wicked persons of whom Paul says: "I have delivered them to Satan, that they
may learn not to blaspheme."823 Do you see now how the Most High spares neither the
righteous nor the wicked? Or is it the sword that frightens you? For to be buffeted is not
so bad as to be put to death. But did not the thousands of martyrs suffer death in various
forms? And could their persecutors have had this power against them except it had been
given them by God, who thus spared neither the righteous nor the wicked? For the Lord
Himself, the chief martyr, says expressly to Pilate: "Thou couldst have no power at all against
me, except it were given thee from above."824 Paul also, besides recording his own experience,
says that the afflictions and persecutions of the righteous exhibit the judgment of God.825
This truth is set forth at length by the Apostle Peter in the passage already quoted, where
he says: "It is time that judgment should begin at the house of the Lord. And if it first begin
at us, what shall the end be of those that believe not the gospel of God? And if the righteous
scarcely are saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"826 Peter also explains
how the wicked are not spared, for they are branches broken off to be burnt; while the
righteous are not spared, because their purification is to be brought to perfection. He ascribes
these things to the will of Him who says in the Old Testament, I will spare neither the
righteous nor the wicked; for he says: "It is better, if the will of the Spirit of God be so, that
we suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing."827 So, when by the will of the Spirit of God
men suffer for well-doing, the righteous are not spared; when they suffer for evil-doing, the
wicked are not spared. In both cases it is according to the will of Him who says: I will spare
neither the righteous nor the wicked; correcting the one as a son, and punishing the other
as a transgressor.</p>
<p>21. I have thus shown, to the best of my power, that the God we worship did not abide
from eternity in darkness, but is Himself light, and in Him is no darkness at all; and in
Himself dwells in light inaccessible; and the brightness of this light is His coeternal wisdom.
From what we have said, it appears that God was not taken by surprise by the unexpected
appearance of light, but that light owes its existence to Him as its Creator, as its owes its
continued existence to His approval. Neither was God ignorant of the future, but the author
<note type="footnote">823 1 Tim. i. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">824 John xix. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">825 2 Thess. i. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">826 1 Pet. iv. 17, 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">827 1 Pet. iii. 17.</note>

<pb n="480"/>
of the precept as well as the punisher of disobedience; that by showing His righteous anger
against transgression, He might provide a restraint for the time, and a warning for the future.
Nor does He ask questions from ignorance, but by His very inquiry declares His judgment.
Nor is He curious or timid, but excludes the transgressor from eternal life, which is the just
reward of obedience. Nor is He greedy for blood and fat; but by requiring from a carnal
people sacrifices, suited to their character, He by certain types prefigures the true sacrifice.
Nor is His jealousy an emotion of pale anxiety, but of quiet benevolence, in desire to keep
the soul, which owes chastity to the one true God, from being defiled and prostituted by
serving many false gods. Nor is He enraged with a passion similar to human anger, but is
angry, not in the sense of desiring vengeance, but in the peculiar sense of giving full effect
to the sentence of a righteous retribution. Nor does He destroy thousands of men for trifling
offenses, or for nothing, but manifests to the world the benefit to be obtained from fearing
Him, by the temporal death of those already mortal. Nor does He punish the righteous and
sinners indiscriminately, but chastises the righteous for their good, in order to perfect them,
and gives to sinners the punishment justly due to them. Thus, ye Manichæans, do your
suspicions lead you astray, when, by misunderstanding our Scriptures, or by hearing bad
interpreters, you form a mistaken judgment of Catholics. Hence you leave sound doctrine,
and turn to impious fables; and in your perversity and estrangement from the society of
saints, you reject the instruction of the New Testament, which, as we have shown, contains
statements similar to those which you condemn in the Old Testament. So we are obliged
to defend both Testaments against you as well as against the Pagans.</p>
<p>22. But supposing that there is some one so deluded by carnality as to worship not the
God whom we worship, who is one and true, but the fiction of your suspicions or your
slanders, whom you say we worship, is not even this god better than yours? Observe, I beseech
you, what must be plain to the feeblest understanding; for here there is no need of
great perspicacity. I address all, wise and unwise. I appeal to the common sense and judgment
of all alike. Hear, consider, judge. Would it not have been better for your god to have
remained in darkness from eternity, than to have plunged the light coeternal with him and
cognate to him into darkness? Would it not have been better to have expressed admiration
in surprise at the appearance of a new light coming to scatter the darkness, than to have
been unable to baffle the assault of darkness except by the concession of his own light?
Unhappy if he did this in alarm, and cruel if there was no need of it. Surely it would have
been better to see light, made by himself, and to admire it as good, than to make the light
begotten by himself evil; better than that his own light should become hostile to himself in
repelling the forces of darkness. For this will be the accusation against those who will be
condemned for ever to the mass of darkness, that they suffered themselves to lose their
original brightness, and became the enemies of sacred light. If they did not know from
eternity that they would be thus condemned, they must have suffered the darkness of

<pb n="481"/>
eternal ignorance; or if they did know, the darkness of eternal fear. Thus part of the substance
of your god really did remain from eternity in its own darkness; and instead of admiring
new light on its appearance, it only met with another and a hostile darkness, of which it had
always been in fear. Indeed, God himself must have been in the darkness of fear for this
part of himself, if he was dreading the evil coming upon it. If he did not foresee the evil, he
must have been in the darkness of ignorance. If he foresaw it, and was not in fear, the
darkness of such cruelty is worse than the darkness either of ignorance or of fear. Your god
appears to be destitute of the quality which the apostle commends in the body, which you
insanely believe to be made not by God, but by Hyle: "If one member suffers, all the members
suffer with it."828 But suppose he did suffer; he foresaw, he feared, he suffered, but he could
not help himself. Thus he remained from eternity in the darkness of his own misery; and
then, instead of admiring a new light which was to drive away the darkness, he came in
contact, to the injury of his own light, with another darkness which he had always dreaded.
Again, would it not have been much better, I say, not to have given a commandment like
God, but even to have received a commandment like Adam, which he would be rewarded
for keeping and punished for breaking, acting either way by his own free-will, than to be
forced by inevitable necessity to admit darkness into his light in spite of himself? Surely it
would have been better to have given a precept to human nature, not knowing that it would
become sinful, than to have been driven by necessity to sin contrary to his own divine nature.
Think for a moment, and say how darkness could be conquered by one who was himself
conquered by necessity. Conquered already by this greater enemy, he fought under his
conqueror’s orders against a less formidable opponent. Would it not have been better not
to know where Adam had hid himself, than to have been himself destitute of any means of
escape, first from a hard and hateful necessity, and then from a dissimilar and hostile race?
Would it not have been better to grudge eternal life to human nature, than to consign to
misery the divine nature; to desire the blood and fat of sacrifices, than to be himself
slaughtered in so many forms, on account of his mixture with the blood and fat of every
victim; to be disturbed by jealousy at these sacrifices being offered to other gods as well as
to himself, than to be himself offered on all altars to all devils, as mixed up not only with all
fruits, but also with all animals? Would it not have been much better to be affected even
with human anger, so as to be enraged against both his friends and his enemies for their
sins, than to be himself influenced by fear as well as by anger wherever these passions exist,
or than to share in all the sin that is committed, and in all punishment that is suffered? For
this is the doom of that part of your god which is in confinement everywhere, condemned
to this by himself, not as guilty, but in order to conquer his dreaded enemy. Doomed himself
to such a fatal necessity, the part of himself which he has given over to condemnation might
<note type="footnote">828 1 Cor. xii. 26.</note>

<pb n="482"/>
pardon him, if he were as humble as he is miserable. But how can you pretend to find fault
with God for His anger against both friends and enemies when they sin, when the god of
your fancies first under compulsion compels his own members to go to be devoured by sin,
and then condemns them to remain in darkness? Though he does this, you say that it will
not be in anger. But will he not be ashamed to punish, or to appear to punish, those from
whom he should ask pardon in words such as these: "Forgive me, I beseech you. You are
my members; could I treat you thus, except from necessity? You know yourselves, that you
were sent here because a formidable enemy had arisen; and now you must remain here to
prevent his rising again"? Again, is it not better to slay thousands of men for trifling faults,
or for nothing, than to cast into the abyss of sin, and to condemn to the punishment of
eternal imprisonment, God’s own members, his substance—in fact, God himself? It cannot
properly be said of the real substance of God that it has the choice of sinning or not sinning,
for God’s substance is absolutely unchangeable. God cannot sin, as He cannot deny Himself.
Man, on the contrary, can sin and deny God, or he can choose not to do so. But suppose
the members of your god had, like a rational human soul, the choice of sinning or not sinning;
they might perhaps be justly punished for heinous offenses by confinement in the mass of
darkness. But you cannot attribute to these parts a liberty which you deny to God himself.
For if God had not given them up to sin, he would have been forced to sin himself, by the
prevalence of the race of darkness. But if there was no danger of being thus forced, it was
a sin to send these parts to a place where they incurred this danger. To do so, indeed, from
free choice is a crime deserving the torment which your god unnaturally inflicts upon his
own parts, more than the conduct of these parts in going by his command to a place where
they lost the power of living in righteousness. But if God himself was in danger of being
forced to sin by invasion and capture, unless he had secured himself first by the misconduct
and then by the punishment of his own parts, there can have been no free-will either in your
god or in his parts. Let him not set himself up as judge, but confess himself a criminal. For
though he was forced against his own will, he professes to pass a righteous sentence in
condemning those whom he knows to have suffered evil rather than done it; making this
profession that he may not be thought of as having been conquered; as if it could do a beggar
any good to be called prosperous and happy. Surely it would have been better for your god
to have spared neither righteous nor wicked in indiscriminate punishment (which is Faustus’
last charge against our God), than to have been so cruel to his own members,—first giving
them up to incurable contamination, and then, as if that was not enough, accusing them
falsely of misconduct. Faustus declares that they justly suffer this severe and eternal punishment,
because they allowed themselves to be led astray from their original brightness, and
became hostile to sacred light. But the reason of this, as Faustus says, was that they were so
greedily devoured in the first assault of the princes of darkness, that they were unable to
recover themselves, or to separate themselves from the hostile principle. These souls,

<pb n="483"/>
therefore, did no evil themselves, but in all this were innocent sufferers. The real agent was
he who sent them away from himself into this wretchedness. They suffered more from their
father than from their enemy. Their father sent them into all this misery; while their enemy
desired them as something good, wishing not to hurt them, but to enjoy them. The one
injured them knowingly, the other in ignorance. This god was so weak and helpless that he
could not otherwise secure himself first against an enemy threatening attack, and then
against the same enemy in confinement. Let him, then, not condemn those parts whose
obedience defended him, and whose death secures his safety. If he could not avoid the
conflict, why slander his defenders? When these parts allowed themselves to be led astray
from their original brightness, and became hostile to sacred light, this must have been from
the force of the enemy; and if they were forced against their will, they are innocent; while,
if they could have resisted had they chosen, there is no need of the origin of evil in an imaginary
evil nature, since it is to be found in free-will. Their not resisting, when they could
have done so, is plainly their own fault, and not owing to any force from without. For,
supposing them able to do a thing, to do which is right, while not to do it is great and heinous
sin, their not doing it is their own choice. So, then, if they choose not to do it, the fault is
in their will not in necessity. The origin of sin is in the will; therefore in the will is also the
origin of evil, both in the sense of acting against a just precept, and in the sense of suffering
under a just sentence. There is thus no reason why, in your search for the origin of evil, you
should fall into so great an evil as that of calling a nature so rich in good things the nature
of evil, and of attributing the terrible evil of necessity to the nature of perfect good, before
any commixture with evil. The cause of this erroneous belief is your pride, which you need
not have unless you choose; but in your wish to defend at all hazards the error into which
you have fallen, you take away the origin of evil from free-will, and place it in a fabulous
nature of evil. And thus you come at last to say, that the souls which are to be doomed to
eternal confinement in the mass of darkness became enemies to sacred light not from choice,
but by necessity; and to make your god a judge with whom it is of no use to prove, in behalf
of your clients. that they were under compulsion, and a king who will make no allowance
for your brethren, his own sons and members, whose hostility against you and against
himself you ascribe not to choice, but to necessity. What shocking cruelty! unless you proceed
in the next place to defend your god, as also acting not from choice, but by necessity. So, if
there could be found another judge free from necessity, who could decide the question on
the principles of equity, he would sentence your god to be bound to this mass, not by being
fastened on the outside, but by being shut up inside along with the formidable enemy. The
first in the guilt of necessity ought to be first in the sentence of condemnation. Would it
not be much better, then, in comparison with such a god as this, to choose the god whom
we indeed do not worship, but whom you think or pretend to think we worship? Though
he spares not his servants, whether righteous or sinful, making no proper separation, and

<pb n="484"/>
not distinguishing between punishment and discipline, is he not better than the god who
spares not his own members though innocent, if necessity is no crime, or guilty from their
obedience to him, if necessity itself is criminal; so that they are condemned eternally by him,
along with whom they should have been released, if any liberty was recovered by the victory,
while he should have been condemned along with them if the victory reduced the force of
necessity even so far as to give this small amount of force to justice? Thus the god whom
you represent us as worshipping, though he is not the one true God whom we really worship,
is far better than your god. Neither, indeed, has any existence; but both are the creatures
of your imaginations. But, according to your own representations, the one whom you call
ours, and find fault with, is better than the one whom you call your own, and whom you
worship. 829</p>
<p>23. So also the patriarchs and prophets whom you cry out against are not the men
whom we honor, but men whose characters are drawn from your fancy, prompted by illwill.
And yet even thus as you paint them, I will not be content with showing them to be
superior to your elect, who keep all the precepts of Manichæus, but will prove their superiority
to your god himself. Before proving this, however, I must, with the help of God, defend
our holy fathers the patriarchs and prophets against your accusations, by a clear exposition
of the truth as opposed to the carnality of your hearts. As for you Manichæans, it would be
enough to say that the faults you impute to our fathers are preferable to what you praise in
your own, and to complete your shame by adding that your god can be proved far inferior
to our fathers as you describe them. This would be a sufficient reply for you. But as, even
apart from your perversities, some minds are of themselves disturbed when comparing the
life of the prophets in the Old Testament with that of the apostles in the New,—not discerning
between the manner of the time when the promise was under a veil, and that of the time
when the promise is revealed,—I must first of all reply to those who either have the boldness
to pride themselves as superior in temperance to the prophets, or quote the prophets in
defence of their own bad conduct.</p>
<p>24. First of all, then, not only the speech of these men, but their life also, was prophetic;
and the whole kingdom of the Hebrews was like a great prophet, corresponding to the
greatness of the Person prophesied. So, as regards those Hebrews who were made wise in
heart by divine instruction, we may discover a prophecy of the coming of Christ and of the
Church, both in what they said and in what they did; and the same is true as regards the
divine procedure towards the whole nation as a body. For, as the apostle says, "all these
things were our examples."</p>
<note type="footnote">829 [Augustin certainly makes it appear that the God in the Old Testament is not so bad as the God of the
Manichæans, yet he cannot be said to reach a complete theodicy.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="485"/>
<p>25. Those who find fault with the prophets, accusing them of adultery for instance, in
actions which are above their comprehension, are like those Pagans who profanely charge
Christ with folly or madness because He looked for fruit from a tree out of the season;830
or with childishness, because He stooped down and wrote on the ground, and, after answering
the people who were questioning Him, began writing again.831 Such critics are incapable
of understanding that certain virtues in great minds resemble closely the vices of little minds,
not in reality, but in appearance. Such criticism of the great is like that of boys at school,
whose learning consists in the important rule, that if the nominative is in the singular, the
verb must also be in the singular; and so they find fault with the best Latin author, because
he says, Pars in frusta secant. 832 He should have written, say they, secat. And again,
knowing that religio is spelt with one l, they blame him for writing relligio, when he says,
Relligione patrum.833 Hence it may with reason be said, that as the poetical usage of words
differs from the solecisms and barbarisms of the unlearned, so, in their own way, the figurative
actions of the prophets differ from the impure actions of the vicious. Accordingly, as
a boy guilty of a barbarism would be whipped if he pled the usage of Virgil; so any one
quoting the example of Abraham begetting a son from Hagar, in defence of his own sinful
passion for his wife’s handmaid, ought to be corrected not by caning only, but by severe
scourging, that he may not suffer the doom of adulterers in eternal punishment. This indeed
is a comparison of great and important subjects with trifles; and it is not intended that a
peculiar usage in speech should be put on a level with a sacrament, or a solecism with
adultery. Still, allowing for the difference in the character of the subjects, what is called
learning or ignorance in the proprieties and improprieties of speech, resembles wisdom or
the want of it in reference to the grand moral distinction between virtue and vice.834</p>
<p>26. Instead of entering on the distinctions between the praiseworthy and the blameworthy,
the criminal and the innocent, the dangerous and the harmless, the guilty and the
guiltless, the desirable and the undesirable, which are all illustrations of the distinction
between sin and righteousness, we must first consider what sin is, and then examine the
actions of the saints as recorded in the holy books, that, if we find these saints described as
sinning, we may if possible discover the true reason for keeping these sins in memory by
putting them on record. Again, if we find things recorded which, though they are not sins,
appear so to the foolish and the malevolent, and in fact do not exhibit any virtues, here also
we have to see why these things are put into the Scriptures which we believe to contain
<note type="footnote">830 Matt. xxi. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">831 John viii. 6-8.</note>
<note type="footnote">832 Æn. i. 212.</note>

<note type="footnote">834 [This comparison of the objectors to the Old Testament to blundering school-boys is very fine.—A.H.N.]</note>

<pb n="486"/>
wholesome doctrine as a guide in the present life, and a title to the inheritance of the future.
As regards the examples of righteousness found among the acts of the saints, the propriety
of recording these must be plain even to the ignorant. The question is about those actions
the mention of which may seem useless if they are neither righteous nor sinful, or even
dangerous if the actions are really sinful, as leading people to imitate them, because they
are not condemned in these books, and so may be supposed not to be sinful, or because,
though they are condemned, men may copy them from the idea that they must be venial if
saints did them.</p>
<p>27. Sin, then, is any transgression in deed, or word, or desire, of the eternal law. And
the eternal law is the divine order or will of God, which requires the preservation of natural
order, and forbids the breach of it. But what is this natural order in man? Man, we know,
consists of soul and body; but so does a beast. Again, it is plain that in the order of nature
the soul is superior to the body. Moreover, in the soul of man there is reason, which is not
in a beast. Therefore, as the soul is superior to the body, so in the soul itself the reason is
superior by the law of nature to the other parts which are found also in beasts; and in reason
itself, which is partly contemplation and partly action, contemplation is unquestionably the
superior part. The object of contemplation is the image of God, by which we are renewed
through faith to sight. Rational action ought therefore to be subject to the control of contemplation,
which is exercised through faith while we are absent from the Lord, as it will be
hereafter through sight, when we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.835 Then
in a spiritual body we shall by His grace be made equal to angels, when we put on the garment
of immortality and incorruption, with which this mortal and corruptible shall be clothed,
that death may be swallowed up of victory, when righteousness is perfected through grace.
For the holy and lofty angels have also their contemplation and action. They require of
themselves the performance of the commands of Him whom they contemplate, whose
eternal government they freely because sweetly obey. We, on the other hand, whose body
is dead because of sin, till God quicken also our mortal bodies by His Spirit dwelling in us,
live righteously in our feeble measure, according to the eternal law in which the law of nature
is preserved, when we live by that faith unfeigned which works by love, having in a good
conscience a hope of immortality and incorruption laid up in heaven, and of the perfecting
of righteousness to the measure of an inexpressible satisfaction, for which in our pilgrimage
we must hunger and thirst, while we walk by faith and not by sight.</p>
<note type="footnote">835 1 John iii. 2.</note>

<pb n="487"/>
<p>28. A man, therefore, who acts in obedience to the faith which obeys God, restrains all
mortal affections, and keeps them within the natural limit, regulating his desires so as to
put the higher before the lower. If there was no pleasure in what is unlawful, no one would
sin. To sin is to indulge this pleasure instead of restraining it. And by unlawful is meant
what is forbidden by the law in which the order of nature is preserved. It is a great question
whether there is any rational creature for which there is no pleasure in what is unlawful. If
there is such a class of creatures, it does not include man, nor that angelic nature which
abode not in the truth. These rational creatures were so made, that they had the potentiality
of restraining their desires from the unlawful; and in not doing this they sinned. Great,
then, is the creature man, for he is restored by this potentiality, by which, if he had so chosen,
he would not have fallen. And great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, who created man.
For He created also inferior natures which cannot sin, and superior natures which will not
sin. Beasts do not sin, for their nature agrees with the eternal law from being subject to it,
without being in possession of it. And again, angels do not sin, because their heavenly nature
is so in possession of the eternal law that God is the only object of its desire, and they obey
His will without any experience of temptation. But man, whose life on this earth is a trial
on account of sin, subdues to himself what he has in common with beasts, and subdues to
God what he has in common with angels; till, when righteousness is perfected and immortality
attained, he shall be raised from among beasts and ranked with angels.</p>
<p>29. The exercise or indulgence of the bodily appetites is intended to secure the continued
existence and the invigoration of the individual or of the species. If the appetites go beyond
this, and carry the man, no longer master of himself, beyond the limits of temperance, they
become unlawful and shameful lusts, which severe discipline must subdue. But if this unbridled
course ends in plunging the man into such a depth of evil habits that he supposes
that there will be no punishment of his sinful passions, and so refuses the wholesome discipline
of confession and repentance by which he might be rescued; or, from a still worse insensibility,
justifies his own indulgences in profane opposition to the eternal law of Providence;
and if he dies in this state, that unerring law sentences him now not to correction, but
to damnation.</p>
<p>30. Referring, then, to the eternal law which enjoins the preservation of natural order
and forbids the breach of it, let us see how our father Abraham sinned, that is, how he broke
this law, in the things which Faustus has charged him with as highly criminal. In his irrational
craving to have children, says Faustus, and not believing God, who promised that his
wife Sara should have a son, he defiled himself with a mistress. But here Faustus, in his irrational
desire to find fault, both discloses the impiety of his heresy, and in his error and
ignorance praises Abraham’s intercourse with the handmaid. For as the eternal law—that
is, the will of God the Creator of all—for the preservation of the natural order, permits the
indulgence of the bodily appetite under the guidance of reason in sexual intercourse, not

<pb n="488"/>
for the gratification of passion, but for the continuance of the race through the procreation
of children; so, on the contrary, the unrighteous law of the Manichæans, in order to prevent
their god, whom they bewail as confined in all seeds, from suffering still closer confinement
in the womb, requires married people not on any account to have children, their great desire
being to liberate their god. Instead, therefore, of an irrational craving in Abraham to have
children, we find in Manichæus an irrational fancy against having children. So the one
preserved the natural order by seeking in marriage only the production of a child; while the
other, influenced by his heretical notions, thought no evil could be greater than the confinement
of his god.</p>
<p>31. So, again, when Faustus says that the wife’s being privy to her husband’s conduct
made the matter worse, while he is prompted only by the uncharitable wish to reproach
Abraham and his wife, he really, without intending it, speaks in praise of both. For Sara did
not connive at any criminal action in her husband for the gratification of his unlawful passions;
but from the same natural desire for children that he had, and knowing her own
barrenness, she warrantably claimed as her own the fertility of her handmaid; not consenting
with sinful desires in her husband, but requesting of him what it was proper in him to grant.
Nor was it the request of proud assumption; for every one knows that the duty of a wife is
to obey her husband. But in reference to the body, we are told by the apostle that the wife
has power over her husband’s body, as he has over hers;836 so that, while in all other social
matters the wife ought to obey her husband, in this one matter of their bodily connection
as man and wife their power over one another is mutual,—the man over the woman, and
the woman over the man. So, when Sara could not have children of her own, she wished
to have them by her handmaid, and of the same seed from which she herself would have
had them, if that had been possible. No woman would do this if her love for her husband
were merely an animal passion; she would rather be jealous of a mistress than make her a
mother. So here the pious desire for the procreation of children was an indication of the
absence of criminal indulgence.</p>
<p>32. Abraham, indeed, cannot be defended, if, as Faustus says, he wished to get children
by Hagar, because he had no faith in God, who promised that he should have children by
Sara. But this is an entire mistake: this promise had not yet been made. Any one who reads
the preceding chapters will find that Abraham had already got the promise of the land with
a countless number of inhabitants,837 but that it had not yet been made known to him how
the seed spoken of was to be produced, whether by generation from his own body, or from
his choice in the adoption of a son, or, in the case of its being from his own body, whether
it would be by Sara or another. Whoever examines into this will find that Faustus has made
<note type="footnote">836 1 Cor. vii. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">837 Gen. xii. 3.</note>

<pb n="489"/>
either an imprudent mistake or an impudent misrepresentation. Abraham, then, when he
saw that he had no children, though the promise was to his seed, thought first of adoption.
This appears from his saying of his slave, when speaking to God, "This is mine heir;" as
much as to say, As Thou hast not given me a seed of my own, fulfill Thy promise in this
man. For the word seed may be applied to what has not come out of a man’s own body,
else the apostle could not call us the seed of Abraham: for we certainly are not his descendants
in the flesh; but we are his seed in following his faith, by believing in Christ, whose flesh
did spring from the flesh of Abraham. Then Abraham was told by the Lord "This shall not
be thine heir; but he that cometh out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."838 The thought
of adoption was thus removed; but it still remained uncertain whether the seed which was
to come from himself would be by Sara or another. And this God was pleased to keep
concealed, till a figure of the Old Testament had been supplied in the handmaid. We may
thus easily understand how Abraham, seeing that his wife was barren, and that she desired
to obtain from her husband and her handmaid the offspring which she herself could not
produce, acted not in compliance with carnal appetite, but in obedience to conjugal authority,
believing that Sara had the sanction of God for her wish; because God had already promised
him an heir from his own body, but had not foretold who was to be the mother. Thus, when
Faustus shows his own infidelity in accusing Abraham of unbelief, his groundless accusation
only proves the madness of the assailant. In other cases, Faustus’ infidelity has prevented
him from understanding; but here, in his love of slander, he has not even taken time to read.</p>
<p>33. Again, when Faustus accuses a righteous and faithful man of a shameless profanation
of his marriage from avarice and greed, by selling his wife Sara at different times to the two
kings Abimelech and Pharaoh, telling them that she was his sister, because she was very fair,
he does not distinguish justly between right and wrong, but unjustly condemns the whole
transaction. Those who think that Abraham sold his wife cannot discern in the light of the
eternal law the difference between sin and righteousness; and so they call perseverance obstinacy,
and confidence presumption, as in these and similar cases men of wrong judgment
are wont to blame what they suppose to be wrong actions. Abraham did not become partner
in crime with his wife by selling her to others: but as she gave her handmaid to her husband,
not to gratify his passion, but for the sake of offspring, in the authority she had consistently
with the order of nature, requiring the performance of a duty, not complying with a sinful
desire; so in this case, the husband, in perfect assurance of the chaste attachment of his wife
to himself, and knowing her mind to be the abode of modest and virtuous affection, called
her his sister, without saying that she was his wife, lest he himself should be killed, and his
wife fall into the hands of strangers and evil-doers: for he was assured by his God that He
would not allow her to suffer violence or disgrace. Nor was he disappointed in his faith and
<note type="footnote">838 Gen. xv. 3, 4.</note>

<pb n="490"/>
hope; for Pharaoh, terrified by strange occurrences, and after enduring many evils on account
of her, when he was informed by God that Sara was Abraham’s wife, restored her with
honor uninjured. Abimelech also did the same, after learning the truth in a dream.</p>
<p>34. Some people, not scoffers and evil-speakers like Faustus, but men who pay due
honor to the Scriptures, which Faustus finds fault with because he does not understand
them, or which he fails to understand because of his fault-finding, in commenting on this
act of Abraham, are of opinion that he stumbled from weakness of faith, and denied his wife
from fear of death, as Peter denied the Lord. If this is the correct view, we must allow that
Abraham sinned; but the sin should not cancel or obliterate all his merits, any more than
in the case of the apostle. Besides, to deny his wife is not the same as to deny the Saviour.
But when there is another explanation, why not abide by it, instead of giving blame without
cause, since there is no proof that Abraham told a lie from fear? He did not deny that Sara
was his wife in answer to any question on the subject; but when asked who she was, he said
she was his sister, without denying her to be his wife: he concealed part of the truth, but
said nothing false.</p>
<p>35. It is waste of time to observe Faustus’ remark, that Abraham falsely called Sara his
sister; as if Faustus had discovered the family of Sara, though it is not mentioned in Scripture.
In a matter which Abraham knew, and we do not, it is surely better to believe the patriarch
when he says what he knows, than to believe Manichæus when he finds fault with what he
knows nothing about. Since, then, Abraham lived at that period in human history, when,
though marriage had become unlawful between children of the same parents, or of the same
father or mother, no law or authority interfered with the custom of marriage between the
children of brothers, or any less degree of consanguinity, why should he not have had as
wife his sister, that is, a woman descended from his father? For he himself told the king,
when he restored Sara, that she was his sister by his father, and not by his mother. And on
this occasion he could not have been led to tell a falsehood from fear, for the king knew that
she was his wife, and was restoring her with honor, because he had been warned by God.
We learn from Scripture that, among the ancients, it was customary to call cousins brothers
and sisters. Thus Tobias says in his prayer to God, before having intercourse with his wife,
"And now, O Lord, Thou knowest that not in wantonness I take to wife my sister;"839 though
she was not sprung immediately from the same father or the same mother, but only belonged
to the same family. And Lot is called the brother of Abraham, though Abraham was his
uncle.840 And, by the same use of the word, those called in the Gospel the Lord’s brothers
are certainly not children of the Virgin Mary, but all the blood relations of the Lord.841</p>
<note type="footnote">839 Tob. viii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">840 Gen. xiii. 8, and xi. 31.</note>
<note type="footnote">841 Matt. xii. 46.</note>

<pb n="491"/>
<p>36. Some may say, Why did not Abraham’s confidence in God prevent his being afraid
to confess his wife? God could have warded off from him the death which he feared, and
could have protected both him and his wife while among strangers, so that Sara, although
very fair, should not have been desired by any one, nor Abraham killed on account of her.
Of course, God could have done this; it would be absurd to deny it. But if, in reply to the
people, Abraham had told them that Sara was his wife, his trust in God would have included
both his own life and the chastity of Sara. Now it is part of sound doctrine, that when a man
has any means in his power, he should not tempt the Lord his God. So it was not because
the Saviour was unable to protect His disciples that He told them, "When ye are persecuted
in one city, flee to another."842 And He Himself set the example. For though He had the
power of laying down His own life, and did not lay it down till He chose to do so, still when
an infant He fled to Egypt, carried by His parents;843 and when He went up to the feast, He
went not openly, but secretly, though at other times He spoke openly to the Jews, who in
spite of their rage and hostility could not lay hands on Him, because His hour was not
come,844—not the hour when He would be obliged to die, but the hour when He would
consider it seasonable to be put to death. Thus He who displayed divine power by teaching
and reproving openly, without allowing the rage of his enemies to hurt Him, did also, by
escaping and concealing Himself, exhibit the conduct becoming the feebleness of men, that
they should not tempt God when they have any means in their power of escaping threatened
danger. So also in the apostle, it was not from despair of divine assistance and protection,
or from loss of faith, that he was let down over the wall in a basket, in order to escape being
taken by his enemies:845 not from want of faith in God did he thus escape, but because not
to escape, when this escape was possible, would have been tempting God. Accordingly,
when Abraham was among strangers, and when, on account of the remarkable beauty of
Sara, both his life and her chastity were in danger, since it was in his power to protect not
both of these, but one only,—his life, namely,—to avoid tempting God he did what he could;
and in what he could not do, he trusted to God. Unable to conceal his being a man, he
concealed his being a husband, lest he should be put to death; trusting to God to preserve
his wife’s purity.</p>
<p>37. There might also be a difference of opinion on the nice point whether Sara’s chastity
would have been violated even if some one had intercourse with her, since she submitted
<note type="footnote">842 Matt. x. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">843 Matt. ii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">844 John vii. 10, 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">845 Acts ix. 25.</note>

<pb n="492"/>
to this to save her husband’s life, both with his knowledge and by his authority. In this there
would be no desertion of conjugal fidelity or rebellion against her husband’s authority; in
the same way as Abraham was not an adulterer, when, in submission to the lawful authority
of his wife, he consented to be made a father by his wife’s handmaid. But, from the nature
of the relationship, for a wife to have two husbands, both in life, is not the same thing as for
a man to have two wives: so that we regard the explanation already given of Abraham’s
conduct as the most correct and unobjectionable; that our father Abraham avoided tempting
God by taking what measures he could for the preservation of his own life, and that he
showed his hope in God by entrusting to Him the chastity of his wife.</p>
<p>38. But a pleasure which all must feel is obtained from this narrative so faithfully recorded
in the Holy Scriptures, when we examine into the prophetic character of the action, and
knock with pious faith and diligence at the door of the mystery, that the Lord may open,
and show us who was prefigured in the ancient personage, and whose wife this is, who, while
in a foreign land and among strangers, is not allowed to be stained or defiled, that she may
be brought to her own husband without spot or wrinkle. Thus we find that the righteous
life of the Church is for the glory of Christ, that her beauty may bring honor to her husband,
as Abraham was honored on account of the beauty of Sara among the inhabitants of that
foreign land. To the Church, to whom it is said in the Song of Songs, "O thou fairest among
women,"846 kings offer gifts in acknowledgment of her beauty; as king Abimelech offered
gifts to Sara, admiring the grace of her appearance; all the more that, while he loved, he was
not allowed to profane it. The holy Church, too is in secret the spouse of the Lord Jesus
Christ. For it is secretly, and in the hidden depths of the Spirit, that the soul of man is joined
to the word of God, so that they two are one flesh; of which the apostle speaks as a great
mystery in marriage, as referring to Christ and the Church.847 Again, the earthly kingdom
of this world, typified by the kings which were not allowed to defile Sara, had no knowledge
or experience of the Church as the spouse of Christ, that is, of how faithfully she maintained
her relation to her Husband, till it tried to violate her, and was compelled to yield to the divine
testimony borne by the faith of the martyrs, and in the person of later monarchs was brought
humbly to honor with gifts the Bride whom their predecessors had not been able to humble
by subduing her to themselves. What, in the type, happened in the reign of one and the
same king, is fulfilled in the earlier monarchs of this era and their successors.</p>
<p>39. Again, when it is said that the Church is the sister of Christ, not by the mother but
by the father, we learn the excellence of the relation, which is not of the temporary nature
of earthly descent, but of divine grace, which is everlasting. By this grace we shall no longer
be a race of mortals when we receive power to be called and to become sons of God. This
<note type="footnote">846 Cant. i. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">847 Eph. v. 31, 32.</note>

<pb n="493"/>
grace we obtain not from the synagogue, which is the mother of Christ after the flesh, but
from God the Father. And when Christ calls us into another life where there is no death,
He teaches us, instead of acknowledging, to deny the earthly relationship, where death soon
follows upon birth; for He says to His disciples, "Call no man your father upon earth; for
you have one Father, who is in heaven."848 And He set us an example of this when He said,
"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? And stretching forth His hand to His disciples,
He said, These are my brethren." And lest any one should think that He referred to
an earthly relationship, He added, "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father, the same is
my brother, and sister, and mother;"849 as much as to say, I derive this relationship from
God my Father, not from the Synagogue my mother; I call you to eternal life, where I have
an immortal birth, not to earthly life, for to call you away from this life I have taken mortality.</p>
<p>40. As for the reason why, though it is concealed among strangers whose wife the
Church is, it is not hidden whose sister she is, it is plainly because it is obscure and hard to
understand how the human soul and the Word of God are united or mingled, or whatever
word may be used to express this connection between God and the creature. It is from this
connection that Christ and the Church are called bridegroom and bride, or husband and
wife. The other relationship, in which Christ and all the saints are brethren by divine grace
and not by earthly consanguinity, or by the father and not by the mother, is more easily
expressed in words, and more easily understood. For the same grace makes all the saints
to be also brethren of one another; while in their society no one is the bridegroom of all the
rest. So also, notwithstanding the surpassing justice and wisdom of Christ, His manhood
was much more plainly and readily recognized by strangers, who, indeed, were not wrong
in believing Him to be man, but they did not understand His being God as well as man.
Hence Jeremiah says: "He is both a man, and who shall know Him?"850 He is a man, for it
is made manifest that He is a brother. And who shall know Him? for it is concealed that
He is a husband. This must suffice as a defense of our father Abraham against Faustus’
impudence and ignorance and malice.</p>
<p>41. Lot also, the brother of Abraham, was just and hospitable in Sodom, and was found
worthy to escape the conflagration which prefigured the future judgment; for he was free
from all participation in the corruption of the people of Sodom. He was a type of the body
of Christ, which in the person of all the saints both groans now among the ungodly and
wicked, to whose evil deeds it does not consent, and will at the end of the world be rescued
from their society, when they are doomed to the punishment of eternal fire. Lot’s wife was
the type of a different class of men,—of those, namely, who, when called by the grace of

<pb n="494"/>
God, look back, instead of, like Paul, forgetting the things that are behind, and looking forward
to the things that are before.851 The Lord Himself says: "No man that putteth his
hand to the plough, and looketh back, is fit for the kingdom of Heaven."852 Nor did He
omit to mention the case of Lot’s wife; for she, for our warning, was turned into a pillar of
salt, that being thus seasoned we might not trifle thoughtlessly with this danger, but be on
our guard against it. So, when the Lord was admonishing every one to get rid of the things
that are behind by the most strenuous endeavor to reach the things that are before, He said,
"Remember Lot’s wife."853 And, in addition to these, there is still a third type in Lot, when
his daughters lay with him. For here Lot seems to prefigure the future law; for those who
spring from the law, and are placed under the law, by misunderstanding it, stupefy it, as it
were, and bring forth the works of unbelief by an unlawful use of the law. "The law is good"
says the apostle, "if a man use it lawfully."854</p>
<p>42. It is no excuse for this action of Lot or of his daughters that it represented the perversity
which was afterwards in certain cases to be displayed. The purpose of Lot’s daughters
is one thing, and the purpose of God is another, in allowing this to happen that He might
make some truth manifest; for God both pronounces judgment on the actions of the people
of those times, and arranges in His providence for the prefigurement of the future. As a
part of Scripture, this action is a prophecy; as part of the history of those concerned, it is a
crime.</p>
<p>43. At the same time there is in this transaction no reason for the torrent of abuse which
Faustus’ blind hostility discharges on it. By the eternal law which requires the preservation
of the order of nature and condemns its violation, the judgment in this case is not what it
would have been if Lot had been prompted by a criminal passion to commit incest with his
daughters, or if they had been inflamed with unnatural desires. In justice, we must ask not
only what was done, but with what motive, in order to obtain a fair view of the action as the
effect of that motive. The resolution of Lot’s daughters to lie with their father was the effect
of the natural desire for offspring in order to preserve the race; for they supposed that there
were no other men to be found, thinking that the whole world had been consumed in that
conflagration, which, for all they knew, had left no one alive but themselves. It would have
been better for them never to have been mothers, than to have become mothers by their
own father. But still, the fulfillment of a desire like this is very different from the accursed
gratification of lust.</p>

<pb n="495"/>
<p>44. Knowing that their father would condemn their design, Lot’s daughters thought it
necessary to fulfill it without his knowledge. We are told that they made him drunk, so that
he was unaware of what happened. His guilt therefore is not that of incest, but of drunkenness.
This, too, is condemned by the eternal law, which allows meat and drink only as required
by nature for the preservation of health. There is, indeed, a great difference between
a drunk man and an habitual drunkard; for the drunkard is not always drunk, and a man
may be drunk on one occasion without being a drunkard. However, in the case of a righteous
man, we require to account for even one instance of drunkenness. What can have made
Lot consent to receive from his daughters all the cups of wine which they went on mixing
for him, or perhaps giving him unmixed? Did they feign excessive grief, and did he resort
to this consolation in their loneliness, and in the loss of their mother, thinking that they
were drinking too, while they only pretended to drink? But this does not seem a proper
method for a righteous man to take in consoling his friends when in trouble. Had the
daughters learned in Sodom some vile art which enabled them to intoxicate their father
with a few cups, so that in his ignorance he might sin, or rather be sinned against? But it is
not likely that the Scripture would have omitted all notice of this, or that God would have
allowed His servant to be thus abused without any fault of his own.</p>
<p>45. But we are defending the sacred Scriptures, not man’s sins. Nor are we concerned
to justify this action, as if our God had either commanded it or approved of it; or as if, when
men are called just in Scripture, it meant that they could not sin if they chose. And as, in
the books which those critics find fault with, God nowhere expresses approval of this action,
what thoughtless folly it is to bring a charge from this narrative against these writings, when
in other places such actions are condemned by express prohibitions! In the story of Lot’s
daughters the action is related, not commended. And it is proper that the judgment of God
should be declared in some cases, and concealed in others, that by its manifestation our ignorance
may be enlightened, and that by its concealment our minds may be improved by
the exercise of recalling what we already know, or our indolence stimulated to seek for an
explanation. Here, then, God, who can bring good out of evil, made nations arise from this
origin, as He saw good, but did not bring upon His own Scriptures the guilt of man’s sin.
It is God’s writing, but not His doing; He does not propose these things for our imitation,
but holds them up for our warning.</p>
<p>46. Faustus’ effrontery appears notably in his accusing Isaac also, the son of Abraham
of pretending that his wife Rebecca was his sister.855 For as regards the family of Rebecca
Scripture is not silent, and it appears that she was his sister in the well-known sense of the
word. His concealing that she was his wife is not surprising, nor is it insignificant, if he did
it in imitation of his father, so that he can be justified on the same grounds. We need only
<note type="footnote">855 Gen. xxvi. 7.</note>

<pb n="496"/>
refer to the answer already given to Faustus’ charge against Abraham, as being equally applicable
to Isaac. Perhaps, however some inquirer will ask what typical significance there
is in the foreign king discovering Rebecca to be the wife of Isaac by seeing him playing with
her; for he would not have known, had he not seen Isaac playing with Rebecca as it would
have been improper to do with a woman not his wife. When holy men act thus as husbands,
they do it not foolishly, but designedly: for they accommodate themselves to the nature of
the weaker sex in words and actions of gentle playfulness; not in effeminacy, but in subdued
manliness. But such behavior towards any woman except a wife would be disgraceful. This
is a question in good manners, which is referred to only in case some stern advocate of insensibility
should find fault with the holy man even for playing with his wife. For if these
men without humanity see a sedate man chatting playfully with children that he may adapt
himself to the childish understanding with kindly sympathy, they think that he is insane;
forgetting that they themselves were once children, or unthankful for their maturity. The
typical meaning, as regards Christ and His Church, which is to be found in this great patriarch
playing with his wife, and in the conjugal relation being thus discovered, will be seen by
every one who, to avoid offending the Church by erroneous doctrine, carefully studies in
Scripture the secret of the Church’s Bridegroom. He will find that the Husband of the
Church concealed for a time in the form of a servant the majesty in which He was equal to
the Father, as being in the form of God, that feeble humanity might be capable of union
with Him, and that so He might accommodate Himself to His spouse. So far from being
absurd, it has a symbolic suitableness that the prophet of God should use a playfulness which
is of the flesh to meet the affection of his wife, as the Word of God Himself became flesh
that He might dwell among us.</p>
<p>47. Again, Jacob the son of Isaac is charged with having committed a great crime because
he had four wives. But here there is no ground for a criminal accusation: for a plurality of
wives was no crime when it was the custom; and it is a crime now, because it is no longer
the custom. There are sins against nature, and sins against custom, and sins against the
laws. In which, then, of these senses did Jacob sin in having a plurality of wives? As regards
nature, he used the women not for sensual gratification, but for the procreation of children.
For custom, this was the common practice at that time in those countries. And for the laws,
no prohibition existed. The only reason of its being a crime now to do this, is because custom
and the laws forbid it. Whoever despises these restraints, even though he uses his wives
only to get children, still commits sin, and does an injury to human society itself, for the
sake of which it is that the procreation of children is required. In the present altered state
of customs and laws, men can have no pleasure in a plurality of wives, except from an excess

<pb n="497"/>
of lust; and so the mistake arises of supposing that no one could ever have had many wives
but from sensuality and the vehemence of sinful desires. Unable to form an idea of men
whose force of mind is beyond their conception, they compare themselves with themselves,
as the apostle says,856 and so make mistakes. Conscious that, in their intercourse though
with one wife only, they are often influenced by mere animal passion instead of an intelligent
motive, they think it an obvious inference that, if the limits of moderation are not observed
where there is only one wife, the infirmity must be aggravated where there are more than
one.</p>
<p>48. But those who have not the virtues of temperance must not be allowed to judge of
the conduct of holy men, any more than those in fever of the sweetness and wholesomeness
of food. Nourishment must be provided not by the dictates of the sickly taste, but rather
by the judgment and direction of health, so as to cure the sickness. If our critics, then, wish
to attain not a spurious and affected, but a genuine and sound moral health, let them find
a cure in believing the Scripture record, that the honorable name of saint is given not without
reason to men who had several wives; and that the reason is this, that the mind can exercise
such control over the flesh as not to allow the appetite implanted in our nature by Providence
to go beyond the limits of deliberate intention. By a similar misunderstanding, this criticism,
which consists rather in dishonest slander than in honest judgment, might accuse the holy
apostles too of preaching the gospel to so many people, not from the desire of begetting
children to eternal life, but from the love of human praise. There was no lack of renown to
these our fathers in the gospel, for their praise was spread in numerous tongues through
the churches of Christ. In fact, no greater honor and glory could have been paid by men to
their fellow-creatures. It was the sinful desire for this glory in the Church which led the
reprobate Simon in his blindness to wish to purchase for money what was freely bestowed
on the apostles by divine grace.857 There must have been this desire of glory in the man
whom the Lord in the Gospel checks in his desire to follow Him, saying, "The foxes have
holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay His
Head."858 The Lord saw that his mind was darkened by false appearances and elated by
sudden emotion, and that there was no ground of faith to afford a lodging to the Teacher
of humility; for in Christ’s discipleship the man sought not Christ’s grace, but his own glory.
By this love of glory those were led away whom the Apostle Paul characterizes as preaching
Christ not sincerely, but of contention and envy; and yet the apostle rejoices in their
preaching, knowing that it might happen that, while the preachers gratified their desire for
human praise, believers might be born among their hearers,—not as the result of the envious
<note type="footnote">856 2 Cor. x. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">857 Acts viii. 18-20.</note>
<note type="footnote">858 Matt. viii. 20.</note>

<pb n="498"/>
feeling which made them wish to rival or surpass the fame of the apostles, but by means of
the gospel which they preached, though not sincerely; so that God might bring good out of
their evil. So a man may be induced to marry by sensual desire, and not to beget children;
and yet a child may be born, a good work of God, due to the natural power, not to the misconduct
of the parent. As, therefore, the holy apostles were gratified when their doctrine
met with acceptance from their hearers, not because they were greedy for praise, but because
they desired to spread the truth; so the holy patriarchs in their conjugal intercourse were
actuated not by the love of pleasure, but by the intelligent desire for the continuance of their
family. Thus the number of their hearers did not make the apostles ambitious; nor did the
number of their wives make the patriarchs licentious. But why defend the husbands, to
whose character the divine word bears the highest testimony, when it appears that the wives
themselves looked upon their connection with their husbands only as a means of getting
sons? So, when they found themselves barren, they gave their handmaids to their husbands;
so that while the handmaids had the fleshly motherhood, the wives were mothers in intention.</p>
<p>49. Faustus makes a most groundless statement when he accuses the four women of
quarreling like abandoned characters for the possession of their husband. Where Faustus
read this I know not, unless it was in his own heart, as in a book of impious delusions, in
which Faustus himself is seduced by that serpent with regard to whom the apostle feared
for the Church, which he desired to present as a chaste virgin to Christ; lest, as the serpent
had deceived Eve by his subtlety, so he should also corrupt their minds by turning them
away from the simplicity of Christ.859 The Manichæans are so fond of this serpent, that
they assert that he did more good than harm. From him Faustus must have got his mind
corrupted with the lies instilled into it, which he now reproduces in these infamous calumnies,
and is even bold enough to put down in writing. It is not true that one of the handmaids
carried off Jacob from the other, or that they quarreled about possessing him. There was
arrangement, because there was no licentious passion; and the law of conjugal authority
was all the stronger that there was none of the lawlessness of fleshly desire. His being hired
by one of his wives proves what is here said, in plain opposition to the libels of the
Manichæans. Why should one have hired him, unless by the arrangement he was to have
gone in to the other? It does not follow that he would never have gone in to Leah unless
she had hired him. He must have gone to her always in her turn, for he had many children
by her; and in obedience to her he had children by her hand-maid, and afterwards, without
any hiring, by herself. On this occasion it was Rachel’s turn, so that she had the power so
expressly mentioned in the New Testament by the apostle, "The husband hath not power
over his own body, but the wife."860 Rachel had a bargain with her sister, and, being in her
<note type="footnote">859 2 Cor. xi. 2, 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">860 1 Cor. vii. 4.</note>

<pb n="499"/>
sister’s debt, she referred her to Jacob, her own debtor. For the apostle uses this figure when
he says, "Let the husband render unto the wife what is due."861 Rachel gave what was in her
power as due from her husband, in return for what she had chosen to take from her sister.</p>
<p>50. If Jacob had been of such a character as Faustus in his incurable blindness supposes,
and not a servant of righteousness rather than of concupiscence, would he not have been
looking forward eagerly all day to the pleasure of passing the night with the more beautiful
of his wives, whom he certainly loved more than the other, and for whom he paid the price
of twice seven years of gratuitous service? How, then, at the close of the day, on his way to
his beloved, could he have consented to be turned aside, if he had been such as the ignorant
Manichæans represent him? Would he not have disregarded the wish of the women, and
insisted upon going to the fair Rachel, who belonged to him that night not only as his lawful
wife, but also as coming in regular order? He would thus have used his power as a husband,
for the wife also has not power over her own body, but the husband; and having on this
occasion the arrangement in their obedience in favor of the gratification of his love of beauty,
he might have enforced his authority the more successfully. In that case it would be to the
credit of the women, that while he thought of his own pleasure they contended about having
a son. As it was, this virtuous man, in manly control of sensual appetite, thought more of
what was due from him than to him, and instead of using his power for his own pleasure,
consented to be only the debtor in this mutual obligation. So he consented to pay the debt
to the person to whom she to whom it was due wished him to pay it. When, by this private
bargain of his wives, Jacob was suddenly and unexpectedly forced to turn from the beautiful
wife to the plain one, he did not give way either to anger or to disappointment, nor did he
try to persuade his wives to let him have his own way; but, like a just husband and an intelligent
parent, seeing his wives concerned about the production of children, which was all
he himself desired in marriage, he thought it best to yield to their authority, in desiring that
each should have a child: for, since all the children were his, his own authority was not
impaired. As if he had said to them: Arrange as you please among yourselves which is to
be the mother; it matters not to me, since in any case I am the father. This control over the
appetites, and simple desire to beget children, Faustus would have been clever enough to
see and approve, unless his mind had been corrupted by the shocking tenets of his sect,
which lead him to find fault with everything in the Scripture, and, moreover, teach him to
condemn as the greatest crime the procreation of children, which is the proper design of
marriage.</p>
<p>51. Now, having defended the character of the patriarch, and refuted an accusation
arising from these detestable errors, let us avail ourselves of the opportunity of searching
out the symbolical meaning, and let us knock with the reverence of faith, that the Lord may
<note type="footnote">861 1 Cor. vii. 3.</note>

<pb n="500"/>
open to us the typical significance of the four wives of Jacob, of whom two were free, and
two slaves. We see that, in the wife and bond-slaves of Abraham, the apostle understands
the two Testaments.862 But there, one represents each; here, the application does not suit
so well, as there are two and two. There, also, the son of the bond-slave is disinherited; but
here the sons of the slaves receive the land of promise along with the sons of the free women:
so that this type must have a different meaning.</p>
<p>52. Supposing that the two free wives point to the New Testament, by which we are
called to liberty, what is the meaning of there being two? Perhaps because in Scripture, as
the attentive reader will find, we are said to have two lives in the body of Christ,—one temporal,
in which we suffer pain, and one eternal, in which we shall behold the blessedness of
God. We see the one in the Lord’s passion, and the other in His resurrection. The names
of the women point to this meaning: It is said that Leah means Suffering, and Rachel the
First Principle made visible, or the Word which makes the First Principle visible. The action,
then, of our mortal human life, in which we live by faith, doing many painful tasks without
knowing what benefit may result from them to those in whom we are interested, is Leah,
Jacob’s first wife. And thus she is said to have had weak eyes. For the purposes of mortals
are timid, and our plans uncertain. Again, the hope of the eternal contemplation of God,
accompanied with a sure and delightful perception of truth, is Rachel. And on this account
she is described as fair and well-formed. This is the beloved of every pious student, and for
this he serves the grace of God, by which our sins, though like scarlet, are made white as
snow.863 For Laban means making white; and we read that Jacob served Laban for Rachel.864
No man turns to serve righteousness, in subjection to the grace of forgiveness, but that he
may live in peace in the Word which makes visible the First Principle, or God; that is, he
serves for Rachel, not for Leah. For what a man loves in the works of righteousness is not
the toil of doing and suffering. No one desires this life for its own sake; as Jacob desired not
Leah, who yet was brought to him, and became his wife, and the mother of children. Though
she could not be loved of herself, the Lord made her be borne with as a step to Rachel; and
then she came to be approved of on account of her children. Thus every useful servant of
God, brought into His grace by which his sins are made white, has in his mind, and heart,
and affection, when he thus turns to God, nothing but the knowledge of wisdom. This we
often expect to attain as a reward for practising the seven precepts of the law which concern
the love of our neighbor, that we injure no one: namely, Honor thy father and mother;
Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shall not kill; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shall not
bear false witness; Thou shalt not desire thy neighbor’s wife; Thou shall not covet thy
<note type="footnote">862 Gal. iv. 22-24.</note>
<note type="footnote">863 Isa. i. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">864 Gen. xxix. 17.</note>

<pb n="501"/>
neighbor’s property. When a man has obeyed these to the best of his ability, and, instead
of the bright joys of truth which he desired and hoped for, finds in the darkness of the
manifold trials of this world that he is bound to painful endurance, or has embraced Leah
instead of Rachel, if there is perseverance in his love, he bears with the one in order to attain
the other; and as if it were said to him, Serve seven other years for Rachel, he hears seven
new commands,—to be poor in spirit, to be meek, to be a mourner, to hunger and thirst
after righteousness, to be merciful, pure, and a peacemaker.865 A man would desire, if it
were possible, to obtain at once the joys of lovely and perfect wisdom, without the endurance
of toil in action and suffering; but this is impossible in mortal life. This seems to be meant,
when it is said to Jacob: "It is not the custom in our country to marry the younger before
the elder."866 The elder may very well mean the first in order of time. So, in the discipline
of man, the toil of doing the work of righteousness precedes the delight of understanding
the truth.</p>
<p>53. To this purpose it is written: "Thou hast desired wisdom; keep the commandments,
and the Lord shall give it thee."867 The commandments are those concerning righteousness,
and the righteousness is that which is by faith, surrounded with the uncertainty of temptations;
so that understanding is the reward of a pious belief of what is not yet understood.
The meaning I have given to these words, "Thou hast desired wisdom; keep the commandments,
and the Lord shall give it thee," I find also in the passage, "Unless ye believe, ye shall
not understand;"868 showing that as righteousness is by faith, understanding comes by
wisdom. Accordingly, in the case of those who eagerly demand evident truth, we must not
condemn the desire, but regulate it, so that beginning with faith it may proceed to the desired
end through good works. The life of virtue is one of toil; the end desired is unclouded wisdom.
Why should I believe, says one, what is not clearly proved? Let me hear some word
which will disclose the first principle of all things. This is the one great craving of the rational
soul in the pursuit of truth. And the answer is, What you desire is excellent, and well worthy
of your love; but Leah is to be married first, and then Rachel. The proper effect of your
eagerness is to lead you to submit to the right method, instead of rebelling against it; for
without this method you cannot attain what you so eagerly long for. And when it is attained,
the possession of the lovely form of knowledge will be in this world accompanied with the
toils of righteousness. For however clear and true our perception in this life may be of the

<note type="footnote">867 Ecclus. i. 33.</note>
<note type="footnote">868 Isa. vii. 9, Vulg.</note>

<pb n="502"/>
unchangeable good, the mortal body is still a weight on the mind and the earthly tabernacle
is a clog on the intellect in its manifold activity. The end then, is one, but many things must
be gone through for the sake of it.</p>
<p>54. Thus Jacob has two free wives; for both are daughters of the remission of sins, or
of whitening, that is, of Laban. One is loved, the other is borne. But she that is borne is the
most and the soonest fruitful, that she may be loved, if not for herself, at least for her children.
For the toil of the righteous is specially fruitful in those whom they beget for the kingdom
of God, by preaching the gospel amid many trials and temptations; and they call those their
joy and crown869 for whom they are in labors more abundantly, in stripes above measure,
in deaths often,870—for whom they have fightings without and fears within.871 Such births
result most easily and plentifully from the word of faith, the preaching of Christ crucified,
which speaks also of His human nature as far as it can be easily understood, so as not to
hurt the weak eyes of Leah. Rachel, again, with clear eye, is beside herself to God,872 and
sees in the beginning the Word of God with God, and wishes to bring forth, but cannot; for
who shall declare His generation? So the life devoted to contemplation, in order to see with
no feeble mental eye things invisible to flesh, but understood by the things that are made,
and to discern the ineffable manifestation of the eternal power and divinity of God, seeks
leisure from all occupation, and is therefore barren. In this habit of retirement, where the
fire of meditation burns bright, there is a want of sympathy with human weakness, and with
the need men have of our help in their calamities. This life also burns with the desire for
children (for it wishes to teach what it knows, and not to go with the corruption of envy873),
and sees its sister-life fully occupied with work and with bringing forth; and it grieves that
men run after that virtue which cares for their wants and weaknesses, instead of that which
has a divine imperishable lesson to impart. This is what is meant when it is said, "Rachel
envied her sister."874 Moreover, as the pure intellectual perception of that which is not
matter, and so is not the object of the bodliy sense, cannot be expressed in words which
spring from the flesh, the doctrine of wisdom prefers to get some lodging for divine truth
in the mind by whatever material figures and illustrations occur, rather than to give up
teaching these things; and thus Rachel preferred that her husband should have children by
her handmaid, rather than that she should be without any children. Bilhah, the name of

<pb n="503"/>
her handmaid, is said to mean old; and so, even when we speak of the spiritual and unchangeable
nature of God, ideas are suggested relating to the old life of the bodily senses.</p>
<p>55. Leah, too, got children by her handmaid, from the desire of having a numerous
family. Zilpah, her handmaid, is, interpreted, an open mouth. So Leah’s handmaid represents
those who are spoken of in Scripture as engaging in the preaching of the gospel with open
mouth, but not with open heart. Thus it is written of some: "This people honor me with
their lips, but their heart is far from me."875 To such the apostle says: "Thou that preachest
that a man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that sayest a man should not commit
adultery, dost thou commit adultery?"876 But that even by this arrangement the free wife
of Jacob, the type of labor or endurance, might obtain children to be heirs of the kingdom,
the Lord says: "What they say, do; but do not after their works."877 And again, the
apostolic life, when enduring imprisonment, says: "Whether Christ is preached in pretence
or in truth, I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice."878 It is the joy of the mother over her
numerous family, though born of her handmaid.</p>
<p>56. In one instance Leah owed her becoming a mother to Rachel, who, in return for
some mandrakes, allowed her husband to give her night to her sister. Some, I know, think
that eating this fruit has the effect of making barren women productive, and that Rachel,
from her desire for children, was thus bent on getting the fruit from her sister. But I should
not agree to this, even had Rachel conceived at the time. As Leah then conceived, and, besides,
had two other children before God opened Rachel’s womb, there is no reason for
supposing any such quality in the mandrake, without any experience to prove it. I will give
my explanation; those better able than I may give a better. Though this fruit is not often
met with, I had once, to my great satisfaction, on account of its connection with this passage
of Scripture, an opportunity of seeing it. I examined the fruit as carefully as I could, not
with the help of any recondite knowledge of the nature of roots or the virtues of plants, but
only as to what I or any one might learn from the sight, and smell, and taste. I thought it a
nice-looking fruit, and sweet-smelling, but insipid; and I confess it is hard to say why Rachel
desired it so much, unless it was for its rarity and its sweet smell. Why the incident should
be narrated in Scripture, in which the fancies of women would not be mentioned as important
unless it was intended that we should learn some important lesson from them, the only
thing I can think of is the very simple idea that the fruit represents a good character; not the
praise given a man by a few just and wise people, but popular report, which bestows greatness
and renown on a man, and which is not desirable for its own sake, but is essential to the

<pb n="504"/>
success of good men in their endeavors to benefit their fellow-men. So the apostle says, that
it is proper to have a good report of those that are without;879 for though they are not infallible,
the lustre of their praise and the odor of their good opinion are a great help to the efforts
of those who seek to benefit them. And this popular renown is not obtained by those that
are highest in the Church, unless they expose themselves to the toils and hazards of an active
life. Thus the son of Leah found the mandrakes when he went out into the field, that is,
when walking honestly towards those that are without. The pursuit of wisdom, on the
other hand, retired from the busy crowd, and lost in calm meditation, could never obtain
a particle of this public approval, except through those who take the management of public
business, not for the sake of being leaders, but in order to be useful. These men of action
and business exert themselves for the public benefit, and by a popular use of their influence
gain the approval of the people even for the quiet life of the student and inquirer after truth;
and thus through Leah the mandrakes come into the hands of Rachel. Leah herself got them
from her first-born son, that is, in honor of her fertility, which represents all the useful result
of a laborious life exposed to the common vicissitudes; a life which many avoid on account
of its troublesome engagements, because, although they might be able to take the lead, they
are bent on study, and devote all their powers to the quiet pursuit of knowledge, in love
with the beauty of Rachel.</p>
<p>57. But as it is right that this studious life should gain public approval by letting itself
be known, while it cannot rightly gain this approval if it keeps its follower in retirement,
instead of using his powers for the management of ecclesiastical affairs, and so prevents his
being generally useful; to this purpose Leah says to her sister, "Is it a small matter that thou
hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also?" 880 The
husband represents all those who, though fit for active life, and able to govern the Church,
in administering to believers the mystery of the faith, from their love of learning and of the
pursuit of wisdom, desire to relinquish all troublesome occupations, and to bury themselves
in the classroom. Thus the words, "Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband?
and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also?" mean, "Is it a small matter that the
life of study keeps in retirement men required for the toils of public life? and does it ask for
popular renown as well?"</p>
<p>58. To get this renown justly, Rachel gives her husband to her sister for the night; that
is, those who, by a talent for business, are fitted for government, must for the public benefit
consent to bear the burden and suffer the hardships of public life; lest the pursuit of wisdom,
to which their leisure is devoted, should be evil spoken of, and should not gain from the
multitude the good opinion, represented by the fruit, which is necessary for the encourage-

<pb n="505"/>
ment of their pupils. But the life of business must be forced upon them. This is clearly
shown by Leah’s meeting Jacob when coming from the field, and laying hold of him, saying,
"Thou shalt come in to me; for I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes."881 As if she
said, Dost thou wish the knowledge which thou lovest to be well thought of? Do not shirk
the toil of business. The same thing happens constantly in the Church. What we read is
explained by what we meet with in our own experience. Do we not everywhere see men
coming from secular employments, to seek leisure for the study and contemplation of truth,
their beloved Rachel, and intercepted mid-way by ecclesiastical affairs, which require them
to be set to work, as if Leah said to them, You must come in to me? When such men minister
in sincerity the mystery of God, so as in the night of this world to beget sons in the faith,
popular approval is gained also for that life, in love for which they were led to abandon
worldly pursuits, and from the adoption of which they were called away to undertake the
benevolent task of government. In all their labors they aim chiefly at this, that their chosen
way of life may have greater and wider renown, as having supplied the people with such
leaders; as Jacob consents to go with Leah, that Rachel may obtain the sweet-smelling and
good-looking fruit. Rachel, too, in course of time, by the mercy of God, brings forth a child
herself, but not till after some time; for it seldom happens that there is a sound, though only
partial, apprehension, without fleshly ideas, of such sacred lessons of wisdom as this: "In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."882</p>
<p>59. This must suffice as a reply to the false accusations brought by Faustus against the
three fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from whom the God whom the Catholic Church
worship was pleased to take His name. This is not the place to discourse on the merits and
piety of these three men, or on the dignity of their prophetic character, which is beyond the
comprehension of carnal minds. It is enough in this treatise to defend them against the
calumnious attacks of malevolence and falsehood, in case those who read the Scriptures in
a carping and hostile spirit should fancy that they have proved anything against the sacredness
and the profitableness of these books, by their attempts to blacken the character of men who
are there mentioned so honorably.</p>
<p>60. It should be added that Lot, the brother, that is the blood relation, of Abraham, is
not to be ranked as equal to those of whom God says, "I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
and of Jacob;" nor does he belong to those testified to in Scripture as having continued
righteous to the end, although in Sodom he lived a pious and virtuous life, and showed a
praiseworthy hospitality, so that he was rescued from the fire, and a land was given by God
to his seed to dwell in, for the sake of his uncle Abraham. On these accounts he is commended
in Scripture—not for intemperance or incest. But when we find bad and good actions
<note type="footnote">881 Gen. xxx. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">882 John i. 1.</note>

<pb n="506"/>
recorded of the same person, we must take warning from the one, and example from the
other. As, then, the sin of Lot, of whom we are told that he was righteous previous to this
sin, instead of bringing a stain on the character of God, or the truth of Scripture, rather calls
on us to approve and admire the record in its resemblance to a faithful mirror, which reflects
not only the beauties and perfections, but also the faults and deformities, of those who approach
it; still more, in the case of Judah, who lay with his daughter-in-law, we may see how
groundless are the reproaches cast on the narrative. The sacred record has an authority
which raises it far above not merely the cavils of a handful of Manichæans, but the determined
enmity of the whole Gentile world; for, in confirmation of its claims, we see that already it
has brought nearly all people from their idolatrous superstitions to the worship of one God,
according to the rule of Christianity. It has conquered the world, not by violence and warfare,
but by the resistless force of truth. Where, then, is Judah praised in Scripture? Where is
anything good said of him, except that in the blessing pronounced by his father he is distinguished
above the rest, because of the prophecy that Christ would come in the flesh from
his tribe? 883</p>
<p>61. Judah, as Faustus says, committed fornication; and besides that, we can accuse him
of selling his brother into Egypt. Is it any disparagement to light, that in revealing all things
it discloses what is unsightly? So neither is the character of Scripture affected by the evil
deeds of which we are informed by the record itself. Undoubtedly, by the eternal law, which
requires the preservation of natural order, and forbids the transgression of it, conjugal intercourse
should take place only for the procreation of children, and after the celebration
of marriage, so as to maintain the bond of peace. Therefore, the prostitution of women,
merely for the gratification of sinful passion, is condemned by the divine and eternal law.
To purchase the degradation of another, disgraces the purchaser; so that, though the sin
would have been greater if Judah had knowingly lain with his daughter-in-law (for if, as the
Lord says, man and wife are no more two, but one flesh,884 a daughter-in-law is the same
as a daughter); still, it is plain that, as regards his own intention, he was disgraced by his
intercourse with an harlot. The woman, on the other hand, who deceived her father-in-law,
sinned not from wantonness, or because she loved the gains of iniquity, but from her desire
to have children of this particular family. So, being disappointed in two of the brothers,
and not obtaining the third, she succeeded by craft in getting a child by their father; and the
reward which she got was kept, not as an ornament, but as a pledge. It would certainly have
been better to have remained childless than to become a mother without marriage. Still,
her desire to have her father-in-law as the father of her children was very different from
having a criminal affection for him. And when, by his order, she was brought out to be
<note type="footnote">883 Gen. xlix. 8-12.</note>
<note type="footnote">884 Matt. xix. 6.</note>

<pb n="507"/>
killed, on her producing the staff and necklace and ring, saying that the father of the child
was the man who had given her those pledges, Judah acknowledged them, and said, "She
hath been more righteous than I"—not praising her, but condemning himself. He blamed
her desire to have children less than his own unlawful passion, which had led him to one
whom he thought to be an harlot. In a similar sense, it is said of some that they justified
Sodom;885 that is, their sin was so great, that Sodom seemed righteous in comparison. And
even allowing that this woman is not spoken of as comparatively less guilty, but is actually
praised by her father-in-law, while, on account of her not observing the established rites of
marriage, she is a criminal in the eye of the eternal law of right, which forbids the transgression
of natural order, both as regards the body, and first and chiefly as regards the mind,
what wonder though one sinner should praise another?</p>
<p>62. The mistake of Faustus and of Manichæism generally, is in supposing that these
objections prove anything against us, as if our reverence for Scripture, and our profession
of regard for its authority, bound us to approve of all the evil actions mentioned in it;
whereas the greater our homage for the Scripture, the more decided must be our condemnation
of what the truth of Scripture itself teaches us to condemn. In Scripture, all fornication
and adultery are condemned by the divine law; accordingly, when actions of this kind are
narrated, without being expressly condemned, it is intended not that we should praise them,
but that we should pass judgment on them ourselves. Every one execrates the cruelty of
Herod in the Gospel, when, in his uneasiness on hearing of the birth of Christ, he commanded
the slaughter of so many infants.886 But this is merely narrated without being condemned.
Or if Manichæan absurdity is bold enough to deny the truth of this narrative, since they do
not admit the birth of Christ, which was what troubled Herod, let them read the account of
the blind fury of the Jews, which is related without any expression of reproach, although
the feeling of abhorrence is the same in all.</p>
<p>63. But, it is said, Judah, who lay with his daughter-in-law, is reckoned as one of the
twelve patriarchs. And was not Judas, who betrayed the Lord, reckoned among the twelve
apostles? And was not this one of them, who was a devil, sent along with them to preach
the gospel?887 In reply to this, it will be said that after his crime Judas hanged himself, and
was removed from the number of the apostles; while Judah, after his evil conduct, was not
only blessed along with his brethren, but got special honor and approval from his father,
who is so highly spoken of in Scripture. But the main lesson to be learned from this is, that
this prophecy refers not to Judah, but to Christ, who was foretold as to come in the flesh
from his tribe; and the very reason for the mention of this crime of Judah is to be found in
<note type="footnote">885 Ezek. xvi. 52.</note>
<note type="footnote">886 Matt. ii. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">887 John vi. 70, 71.</note>

<pb n="508"/>
the desirableness of teaching us to look for another meaning in the words of his father,
which are seen not to be applicable to him in his misconduct, from the praise which they
express.</p>
<p>64. Doubtless, the intention of Faustus’ calumnies is to damage this very assertion, that
Christ was born of the tribe of Judah. Especially, as in the genealogy given by Matthew we
find the name of Zara, whom this woman Tamar bore to Judah. Had Faustus wished to
reproach Jacob’s family merely, and not Christ’s birth, he might have taken the case of Reuben
the first-born, who committed the unnatural crime of defiling his father’s bed, of which
fornication the apostle says, that it was not so much as named among the Gentiles.888 Jacob
also mentions this in his blessing, charging his son with the infamous deed. Faustus might
have brought up this, as Reuben seems to have been guilty of deliberate incest, and there
was no harlot’s disguise in this case, were it not that Tamar’s conduct in desiring nothing
but to have children is more odious to Faustus than if she had acted from criminal passion,
and did he not wish to discredit the incarnation, by bringing reproach on Christ’s progenitors.
Faustus unhappily is not aware that the most true and truthful Saviour is a teacher, not
only in His words, but also in His birth. In His fleshly origin there is this lesson for those
who should believe on Him from all nations, that the sins of their fathers need be no
hindrance to them. Besides, the Bridegroom, who was to call good and bad to His marriage,
889 was pleased to assimilate Himself to His guests, in being born of good and bad.
He thus confirms as typical of Himself the symbol of the Passover, in which it was commanded
that the lamb to be eaten should be taken from the sheep or from the goats—that
is, from the righteous or the wicked.890 Preserving throughout the indication of divinity
and humanity, as man He consented to have both bad and good as His parents, while as
God He chose the miraculous birth from a virgin.</p>
<p>65. The impiety, therefore, of Faustus’ attacks on Scripture can injure no one but himself;
for what he thus assails is now deservedly the object of universal reverence. As has been
said already, the sacred record, like a faithful mirror, has no flattery in its portraits, and
either itself passes sentence upon human actions as worthy of approval or disapproval, or
leaves the reader to do so. And not only does it distinguish men as blameworthy or praiseworthy,
but it also takes notice of cases where the blameworthy deserve praise, and the
praiseworthy blame. Thus, although Saul was blameworthy, it was not the less praiseworthy
in him to examine so carefully who had eaten food during the curse, and to pronounce the
stern sentence in obedience to the commandment of God.891 So, too, he was right in ban-

<pb n="509"/>
ishing those that had familiar spirits and wizards out of the land.892 And although David
was praiseworthy, we are not called on to approve or imitate his sins, which God rebukes
by the prophet. And so Pontius Pilate was not wrong in pronouncing the Lord innocent,
in spite of the accusations of the Jews;893 nor was it praiseworthy in Peter to deny the Lord
thrice; nor, again, was he praiseworthy on that occasion when Christ called him Satan because,
not understanding the things of God, he wished to withhold Christ from his passion,
that is, from our salvation. Here Peter, immediately after being called blessed, is called
Satan.894 Which character most truly belonged to him, we may see from his apostleship,
and from his crown of martyrdom.</p>
<p>66. In the case of David also, we read of both good and bad actions. But where David’s
strength lay, and what was the secret of his success, is sufficiently plain, not to the blind
malevolence with which Faustus assails holy writings and holy men, but to pious discernment,
which bows to the divine authority, and at the same time judges correctly of human conduct.
The Manichæans will find, if they read the Scriptures, that God rebukes David more than
Faustus does.895 But they will read also of the sacrifice of his penitence, of his surpassing
gentleness to his merciless and bloodthirsty enemy, whom David, pious as he was brave,
dismissed unhurt when now and again he fell into his hands.896 They will read of his
memorable humility under divine chastisement, when the kingly neck was so bowed under
the Master’s yoke, that he bore with perfect patience bitter taunts from his enemy, though
he was armed, and had armed men with him. And when his companion was enraged at
such things being said to the king, and was on the point of requiting the insult on the head
of the scoffer, he mildly restrained him, appealing to the fear of God in support of his own
royal order, and saying that this bad happened to him as a punishment from God, who had
sent the man to curse him.897 They will read how, with the love of a shepherd for the flock
entrusted to him, he was willing to die for them, when, after he had numbered the people,
God saw good to punish his sinful pride by lessening the number he boasted of. In this destruction,
God, with whom there is no iniquity, in His secret judgment, both took away the
lives of those whom He knew to be unworthy of life, and by this diminution cured the
vainglory which had prided itself on the number of the people. They will read of that scrupulous
fear of God in his regard for the emblem of Christ in the sacred anointing, which
made David’s heart smite him with regret for having secretly cut off a small piece of Saul’s

garment, that he might prove to him that he had no wish to kill him, when he might have
done it. They will read of his judicious behavior as regards his children, and also of his
tenderness toward them—how, when one was sick, he entreated the Lord for him with many
tears and with much self-abasement, but when he died, an innocent child, he did not mourn
for him; and again, how, when his youthful son was carried away with unnatural hostility
to an infamous violation of his father’s bed, and in a parricidal war, he wished him to live,
and wept for him when he was killed; for he thought of the eternal doom of a soul guilty of
such crimes, and desired that he should live to escape this doom by being brought to submission
and repentance. These, and many other praiseworthy and exemplary things, may
be seen in this holy man by a candid examination of the Scripture narrative, especially if in
humble piety and unfeigned faith we regard the judgment of God, who knew the secrets of
David’s heart, and who, in His infallible inspection, so approves of David as to commend
him as a pattern to his sons.</p>
<p>67. It must have been on account of this inspection of the depths of David’s heart by
the Spirit of God that, when on being reproved by the prophet, he said, I have sinned, he
was considered worthy to be told, immediately after this brief confession, that he was
pardoned—that is, that he was admitted to eternal salvation. For he did not escape the
correction of the fatherly rod, of which God spoke in His threatening, that, while by his
confession he obtained eternal exemption, he might be tried by temporal chastisement.
And it is a remarkable evidence of the strength of David’s faith, and of his meek and sub-
missive spirit, that, when he had been told by the prophet that God had forgiven him, although
the threatened consequences were still permitted to follow, he did not accuse the
prophet of having deluded him, or murmur against God as having mocked him with a declaration
of forgiveness. This deeply holy man, whose soul was lifted up unto God, and not
against God, knew that had not the Lord mercifully accepted his confession and repentance,
his sins would have deserved eternal punishment. So when, instead of this, he was made to
smart under temporal correction, he saw that, while the pardon remained good, wholesome
discipline was also provided. Saul, too, when he was reproved by Samuel, said, I have
sinned.898 Why, then, was he not considered fit to be told, as David was, that the Lord had
pardoned his sin? Is there acceptance of persons with God? Far from it. While to the human
ear the words were the same, the divine eye saw a difference in the heart. The lesson for us
to learn from these things is, that the kingdom of heaven is within us,899 and that we must
worship God from our inmost feelings, that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
may speak, instead of honoring Him with our lips, like the people of old, while our hearts
are far from Him. We may learn also to judge of men, whose hearts we cannot see, only as
<note type="footnote">898 1 Sam. xv. 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">899 Luke xvii. 28.</note>

<pb n="511"/>
God judges, who sees what we cannot, and who cannot be biased or misled. Having, on the
high authority of sacred Scripture, the plainest announcement of God’s opinion of David,
we may regard as absurd or deplorable the rashness of men who hold a different opinion.
The authority of Scripture, as regards the character of these men of ancient times, is supported
by the evidence from the prophecies which they contain, and which are now receiving their
fulfillment.</p>
<p>68. We see the same thing in the Gospel, where the devils confess that Christ is the Son
of God in the words used by Peter, but with a very different heart. So, though the words
were the same, Peter is praised for his faith, while the impiety of the devils is checked. For
Christ, not by human sense, but by divine knowledge, could inspect and infallibly discriminate
the sources from which the words came. Besides, there are multitudes who confess
that Christ is the Son of the living God, without meriting the same approval as Peter—not
only of those who shall say in that day, "Lord, Lord," and shall receive the sentence, "Depart
from me," but also of those who shall be placed on the right hand. They may probably
never have denied Christ even once; they may never have opposed His suffering for our
salvation; they may never have forced the Gentiles to do as the Jews;900 and yet they shall
not be honored equally with Peter, who, though he did all these things, will sit on one of
the twelve thrones, and judge not only the twelve tribes, but the angels. So, again, many
who have never desired another man’s wife, or procured the death of the husband, as David
did, will never reach the place which David nevertheless held in the divine favor. There is
a vast difference between what is in itself so undesirable that it must be utterly rejected, and
the rich and plenteous harvest which may afterwards appear. For farmers are best pleased
with the fields from which, after weeding them, it may be, of great thistles, they receive an
hundred-fold; not with fields which have never had any thistles, and hardly bear thirty-fold.</p>
<p>69. So Moses, too, who was so faithful a servant of God in all his house; the minister of
the holy, just, and good law; of whose character the apostle speaks in the words here
quoted;901 the minister also of the symbols which, though not conferring salvation, promised
the Saviour, as the Saviour Himself shows, when He says, "If ye believed Moses, ye would
also believe me, for he wrote of me,"—from which passage we have already sufficiently
answered the presumptuous cavils of the Manichæans;—this Moses, the servant of the living,
the true, the most high God, that made heaven and earth, not of a foreign substance, but of
nothing—not from the pressure of necessity, but from plenitude of goodness—not by the
suffering of His members, but by the power of His word;—this Moses, who humbly put
from him this high ministry, but obediently accepted it, and faithfully kept it, and diligently
fulfilled it; who ruled the people with vigilance, reproved them with vehemence, loved them
<note type="footnote">900 Gal. ii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">901 Heb. iii. 5.</note>

<pb n="512"/>
with fervor, and bore with them in patience, standing for his subjects before God to receive
His counsel, and to appease His wrath;—this great and good man is not to be judged of
from Faustus’ malicious representations, but from what is said by God, whose word is a true
expression of His true opinion of this man, whom He knew because He made him. For the
sins of men are also known to God, though He is not their author; but He takes notice of
them as a judge in those who refuse to own them, and pardons them as a father in those
who make confession. His servant Moses, as thus described, we love and admire and to the
best of our power imitate, coming indeed far short of his merits, though we have killed no
Egyptian, nor plundered any one, nor carried on any war; which actions of Moses were in
one case prompted by the zeal of the future champion of his people, and in the other cases
commanded by God.</p>
<p>70. It might be shown that, though Moses slew the Egyptian, without being commanded
by God, the action was divinely permitted, as, from the prophetic character of Moses, it
prefigured something in the future. Now however, I do not use this argument, but view the
action as having no symbolical meaning. In the light, then, of the eternal law, it was wrong
for one who had no legal authority to kill the man, even though he was a bad character, besides
being the aggressor. But in minds where great virtue is to come, there is often an early
crop of vices, in which we may still discern a disposition for some particular virtue, which
will come when the mind is duly cultivated. For as farmers, when they see land bringing
forth huge crops, though of weeds, pronounce it good for corn; or when they see wild
creepers, which have to be rooted out, still consider the land good for useful vines; and when
they see a hill covered with wild olives, conclude that with culture it will produce good fruit:
so the disposition of mind which led Moses to take the law into his own hands, to prevent
the wrong done to his brother, living among strangers, by a wicked citizen of the country
from being unrequited, was not unfit for the production of virtue, but from want of culture
gave signs of its productiveness in an unjustifiable manner. He who afterwards, by His angel,
called Moses on Mount Sinai, with the divine commission to liberate the people of Israel
from Egypt, and who trained him to obedience by the miraculous appearance in the bush
burning but not consumed, and by instructing him in his ministry, was the same who, by
the call addressed from heaven to Saul when persecuting the Church, humbled him, raised
him up, and animated him; or in figurative words, by this stroke He cut off the branch,
grafted it, and made it fruitful. For the fierce energy of Paul, when in his zeal for hereditary
traditions he persecuted the Church, thinking that he was doing God service, was like a crop
of weeds showing great signs of productiveness. It was the same in Peter, when he took his
sword out of its sheath to defend the Lord, and cut off the right ear of an assailant, when
the Lord rebuked him with something like a threat, saying, "Put up thy sword into its sheath;
for he that taketh the sword shall perish by the sword."902 To take the sword is to use
<note type="footnote">902 Matt. xxvi. 51, 52.</note>

<pb n="513"/>
weapons against a man’s life, without the sanction of the constituted authority. The Lord,
indeed, had told His disciples to carry a sword; but He did not tell them to use it. But that
after this sin Peter should become a pastor of the Church was no more improper than that
Moses, after smiting the Egyptian, should become the leader of the congregation. In both
cases the trespass originated not in inveterate cruelty, but in a hasty zeal which admitted of
correction. In both cases there was resentment against injury, accompanied in one case by
love for a brother, and in the other by love, though still carnal, of the Lord. Here was evil
to be subdued or rooted out; but the heart with such capacities needed only, like good soil,
to be cultivated to make it fruitful in virtue.</p>
<p>71. Then, as for Faustus’ objection to the spoiling of the Egyptians, he knows not what
he says. In this Moses not only did not sin, but it would have been sin not to do it. It was
by the command of God,903 who, from His knowledge both of the actions and of the hearts
of men, can decide on what every one should be made to suffer, and through whose agency.
The people at that time were still carnal, and engrossed with earthly affections; while the
Egyptians were in open rebellion against God, for they used the gold, God’s creature, in the
service of idols, to the dishonor of the Creator, and they had grievously oppressed strangers
by making them work without pay. Thus the Egyptians deserved the punishment, and the
Israelites were suitably employed in inflicting it. Perhaps, indeed, it was not so much a
command as a permission to the Hebrews to act in the matter according to their own inclinations;
and God, in sending the message by Moses, only wished that they should thus be
informed of His permission. There may also have been mysterious reasons for what God
said to the people on this matter. At any rate, God’s commands are to be submissively received,
not to be argued against. The apostle says, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord?
or who hath been His counsellor?"904 Whether, then, the reason was what I have said, or
whether in the secret appointment of God, there was some unknown reason for His telling
the people by Moses to borrow things from the Egyptians, and to take them away with them,
this remains certain, that this was said for some good reason, and that Moses could not
lawfully have done otherwise than God told him, leaving to God the reason of the command,
while the servant’s duty is to obey.</p>
<p>72. But, says Faustus, it cannot be admitted that the true God, who is also good, ever
gave such a command. I answer, such a command can be rightly given by no other than
the true and good God, who alone knows the suitable command in every case, and who
alone is incapable of inflicting unmerited suffering on any one. This ignorant and spurious
goodness of the human heart may as well deny what Christ says, and object to the wicked
being made to suffer by the good God, when He shall say to the angels, "Gather first the
<note type="footnote">903 Ex. iii. 21, 22; xi. 2; xii. 35, 36.</note>
<note type="footnote">904 Rom. xi. 34.</note>

<pb n="514"/>
tares into bundles to burn them." The servants, however, were stopped when they wished
to do this prematurely: "Lest by chance, when ye would gather the tares, ye root up the
wheat also with them."905 Thus the true and good God alone knows when, to whom, and
by whom to order anything, or to permit anything. In the same way, this human goodness,
or folly rather, might object to the Lord’s permitting the devils to enter the swine, which
they asked to be allowed to do with a mischievous intent,906 especially as the Manichæans
believe that not only pigs, but the vilest insects, have human souls. But setting aside these
absurd notions, this is undeniable, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the only son of God, and
therefore the true and good God, permitted the destruction of swine belonging to strangers,
implying loss of life and of a great amount of property, at the request of devils. No one can
be so insane as to suppose that Christ could not have driven the devils out of the men without
gratifying their malice by the destruction of the swine. If, then, the Creator and Governor
of all natures, in His superintendence, which, though mysterious, is ever just, indulged the
violent and unjust inclination of those lost spirits already doomed to eternal fire, why should
not the Egyptians, who were unrighteous oppressors, be spoiled by the Hebrews, a free
people, who would claim payment for their enforced and painful toil, especially as the earthly
possessions which they thus lost were used by the Egyptians in their impious rites, to the
dishonor of the Creator? Still, if Moses had originated this order, or if the people had done
it spontaneously, undoubtedly it would have been sinful; and perhaps the people did sin,
not in doing what God commanded or permitted, but in some desire of their own for what
they took. The permission given to this action by divine authority was in accordance with
the just and good counsel of Him who uses punishments both to restrain the wicked and
to educate His own people; who knows also how to give more advanced precepts to those
able to bear them, while He begins on a lower scale in the treatment of the feeble. As for
Moses, he can be blamed neither for coveting the property, nor for disputing, in any instance,
the divine authority.</p>
<p>73. According to the eternal law, which requires the preservation of natural order, and
forbids the transgression of it, some actions have an indifferent character, so that men are
blamed for presumption if they do them without being called upon, while they are deservedly
praised for doing them when required. The act, the agent, and the authority for the action
are all of great importance in the order of nature. For Abraham to sacrifice his son of his
own accord is shocking madness. His doing so at the command of God proves him faithful
and submissive. This is so loudly proclaimed by the very voice of truth, that Faustus, eagerly
rummaging for some fault, and reduced at last to slanderous charges, has not the boldness
to attack this action. It is scarcely possible that he can have forgotten a deed so famous, that
<note type="footnote">905 Matt. xiii. 29, 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">906 Matt. viii. 31, 32.</note>

<pb n="515"/>
it recurs to the mind of itself without any study or reflection, and is in fact repeated by so
many tongues, and portrayed in so many places, that no one can pretend to shut his eyes
or his ears to it. If, therefore, while Abraham’s killing his son of his own accord would have
been unnatural, his doing it at the command of God shows not only guiltless but praiseworthy
compliance, why does Faustus blame Moses for spoiling the Egyptians? Your feeling of
disapproval for the mere human action should be restrained by a regard for the divine
sanction. Will you venture to blame God Himself for desiring such actions? Then "Get
thee behind me, Satan, for thou understandest not the things which be of God, but those
which be of men." Would that this rebuke might accomplish in you what it did in Peter,
and that you might hereafter preach the truth concerning God, which you now, judging by
feeble sense, find fault with! as Peter became a zealous messenger to announce to the Gentiles
what he objected to at first, when the Lord spoke of it as His intention.</p>
<p>74. Now, if this explanation suffices to satisfy human obstinacy and perverse misinterpretation
of right actions of the vast difference between the indulgence of passion and presumption
on the part of men, and obedience to the command of God, who knows what to
permit or to order, and also the time and the persons, and the due action or suffering in
each case, the account of the wars of Moses will not excite surprise or abhorrence, for in
wars carried on by divine command, he showed not ferocity but obedience; and God in
giving the command, acted not in cruelty, but in righteous retribution, giving to all what
they deserved, and warning those who needed warning. What is the evil in war? Is it the
death of some who will soon die in any case, that others may live in peaceful subjection?
This is mere cowardly dislike, not any religious feeling. The real evils in war are love of violence,
revengeful cruelty, fierce and implacable enmity, wild resistance, and the lust of
power, and such like; and it is generally to punish these things, when force is required to
inflict the punishment, that, in obedience to God or some lawful authority, good men undertake
wars, when they find themselves in such a position as regards the conduct of human
affairs, that right conduct requires them to act, or to make others act in this way. Otherwise
John, when the soldiers who came to be baptized asked, What shall we do? would have
replied, Throw away your arms; give up the service; never strike, or wound, or disable any
one. But knowing that such actions in battle were not murderous but authorized by law,
and that the soldiers did not thus avenge themselves, but defend the public safety, he replied,
"Do violence to no man, accuse no man falsely, and be content with your wages."907 But as
the Manichæans are in the habit of speaking evil of John, let them hear the Lord Jesus Christ
Himself ordering this money to be given to Cæsar, which John tells the soldiers to be content
with. "Give," He says, "to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s."908 For tribute-money is given
<note type="footnote">907 Luke iii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">908 Matt. xxii. 21.</note>

<pb n="516"/>
on purpose to pay the soldiers for war. Again, in the case of the centurion who said, "I am
a man under authority, and have soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goeth;
and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it," Christ
gave due praise to his faith;909 He did not tell him to leave the service. But there is no need
here to enter on the long discussion of just and unjust ways.</p>
<p>75. A great deal depends on the causes for which men undertake wars, and on the authority
they have for doing so; for the natural order which seeks the peace of mankind, ordains
that the monarch should have the power of undertaking war if he thinks it advisable,
and that the soldiers should perform their military duties in behalf of the peace and safety
of the community. When war is undertaken in obedience to God, who would rebuke, or
humble, or crush the pride of man, it must be allowed to be a righteous war; for even the
wars which arise from human passion cannot harm the eternal well-being of God, nor even
hurt His saints; for in the trial of their patience, and the chastening of their spirit, and in
bearing fatherly correction, they are rather benefited than injured. No one can have any
power against them but what is given him from above. For there is no power but of God,910
who either orders or permits. Since, therefore, a righteous man, serving it may be under an
ungodly king, may do the duty belonging to his position in the State in fighting by the order
of his sovereign,—for in some cases it is plainly the will of God that he should fight, and in
others, where this is not so plain, it may be an unrighteous command on the part of the
king, while the soldier is innocent, because his position makes obedience a duty,—how
much more must the man be blameless who carries on war on the authority of God, of
whom every one who serves Him knows that He can never require what is wrong?</p>
<p>76. If it is supposed that God could not enjoin warfare, because in after times it was
said by the Lord Jesus Christ, "I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but if any one strike
thee on the right cheek, turn to him the left also,"911 the answer is, that what is here required
is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart, and
such were the hearts of our fathers, the righteous men of old. But order required such a
regulation of events, and such a distinction of times, as to show first of all that even earthly
blessings (for so temporal kingdoms and victory over enemies are considered to be, and
these are the things which the community of the ungodly all over the world are continually
begging from idols and devils) are entirely under the control and at the disposal of the one
true God. Thus, under the Old Testament, the secret of the kingdom of heaven, which was
to be disclosed in due time, was veiled, and so far obscured, in the disguise of earthly
promises. But when the fullness of time came for the revelation of the New Testament,
<note type="footnote">909 Matt. viii. 9, 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">910 Rom. xiii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">911 Matt. v. 39.</note>

<pb n="517"/>
which was hidden under the types of the Old, clear testimony was to be borne to the truth,
that there is another life for which this life ought to be disregarded, and another kingdom
for which the opposition of all earthly kingdoms should be patiently borne. Thus the name
martyrs, which means witnesses, was given to those who, by the will of God, bore this
testimony, by their confessions, their sufferings, and their death. The number of such witnesses
is so great, that if it pleased Christ—who called Saul by a voice from heaven, and
having changed him from a wolf to a sheep, sent him into the midst of wolves—to unite
them all in one army, and to give them success in battle, as He gave to the Hebrews, what
nation could withstand them? what kingdom would remain unsubdued? But as the doctrine
of the New Testament is, that we must serve God not for temporal happiness in this life,
but for eternal felicity hereafter, this truth was most strikingly confirmed by the patient endurance
of what is commonly called adversity for the sake of that felicity. So in fullness of
time the Son of God, made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them
that were under the law, made of the seed of David according to the flesh sends His disciples
as sheep into the midst of wolves, and bids them not fear those that can kill the body, but
cannot kill the soul, and promises that even the body will be entirely restored, so that not a
hair shall be lost.912 Peter’s sword He orders back into its sheath, restoring as it was before
the ear of His enemy that had been cut off. He says that He could obtain legions of angels
to destroy His enemies, but that He must drink the cup which His Father’s will had given
Him.913 He sets the example of drinking this cup, then hands it to His followers, manifesting
thus, both in word and deed, the grace of patience. Therefore God raised Him from the
dead, and has given Him a name which is above every name; that in the name of Jesus every
knee should bow, of things in heaven and of things in earth, and of things under the earth;
and that every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.914
The patriarchs and prophets, then, have a kingdom in this world, to show that these kingdoms,
too, are given and taken away by God: the apostles and martyrs had no kingdom
here, to show the superior desirableness of the kingdom of heaven. The prophets, however,
could even in those times die for the truth, as the Lord Himself says, "From the blood of
Abel to the blood of Zacharia;915 and in these days, since the commencement of the fulfillment
of what is prophesied in the psalm of Christ, under the figure of Solomon, which
means the peacemaker, as Christ is our peace,916 "All kings of the earth shall bow to Him,
all nations shall serve Him,"917 we have seen Christian emperors, who have put all their

confidence in Christ, gaining splendid victories over ungodly enemies, whose hope was in
the rites of idolatry and devil-worship. There are public and undeniable proofs of the fact,
that on one side the prognostications of devils were found to be fallacious, and on the other,
the predictions of saints were a means of support; and we have now writings in which those
facts are recorded.</p>
<p>77. If our foolish opponents are surprised at the difference between the precepts given
by God to the ministers of the Old Testament, at a time when the grace of the New was still
undisclosed, and those given to the preachers of the New Testament, now that the obscurity
of the Old is removed, they will find Christ Himself saying one thing at one time, and another
at another. "When I sent you," He says, "without scrip, or purse, or shoes, did ye lack anything?
And they said, Nothing. Then saith He to them, But now, he that hath a scrip, let
him take it, and also a purse; and he that hath not a sword, let him sell his garment, and buy
one." If the Manichæans found passages in the Old and New Testaments differing in this
way, they would proclaim it as a proof that the Testaments are opposed to each other. But
here the difference is in the utterances of one and the same person. At one time He says, "I
sent you without scrip, or purse, or shoes, and ye lacked nothing;" at another, "Now let him
that hath a scrip take it, and also a purse; and he that hath a tunic, let him sell it and buy a
sword." Does not this show how, without any inconsistency, precepts and counsels and
permissions may be changed, as different times require different arrangements? If it is said
that there was a symbolical meaning in the command to take a scrip and purse, and to buy
a sword, why may there not be a symbolical meaning in the fact, that one and the same God
commanded the prophets in old times to make war, and forbade the apostles? And we find
in the passage that we have quoted from the Gospel, that the words spoken by the Lord were
carried into effect by His disciples. For, besides going at first without scrip or purse, and
yet lacking nothing, as from the Lord’s question and their answer it is plain they did, now
that He speaks of buying a sword, they say, "Lo, here are two swords;" and He replied, "It is
enough." Hence we find Peter with a weapon when he cut off the assailant’s ear, on which
occasion his spontaneous boldness was checked, because, although he had been told to take
a sword, he had not been told to use it.918 Doubtless, it was mysterious that the Lord should
require them to carry weapons, and forbid the use of them. But it was His part to give the
suitable precepts, and it was their part to obey without reserve.</p>
<p>78. It is therefore mere groundless calumny to charge Moses with making war, for there
would have been less harm in making war of his own accord, than in not doing it when God
commanded him. And to dare to find fault with God Himself for giving such a command,
or not to believe it possible that a just and good God did so, shows, to say the least, an inability
to consider that in the view of divine providence, which pervades all things from the

highest to the lowest, time can neither add anything nor take away; but all things go, or
come, or remain according to the order of nature or desert in each separate case, while in
men a right will is in union with the divine law, and ungoverned passion is restrained by
the order of divine law; so that a good man wills only what is commanded, and a bad man
can do only what he is permitted, at the same time that he is punished for what he wills to
do unjustly. Thus, in all the things which appear shocking and terrible to human feebleness,
the real evil is the injustice; the rest is only the result of natural properties or of moral demerit.
This injustice is seen in every case where a man loves for their own sake things which
are desirable only as means to an end, and seeks for the sake of something else things which
ought to be loved for themselves. For thus, as far as he can, he disturbs in himself the natural
order which the eternal law requires us to observe. Again, a man is just when he seeks
to use things only for the end for which God appointed them, and to enjoy God as the end
of all, while he enjoys himself and his friend in God and for God. For to love in a friend the
love of God is to love the friend for God. Now both justice and injustice, to be acts at all,
must be voluntary; otherwise, there can be no just rewards or punishments; which no man
in his senses will assert. The ignorance and infirmity which prevent a man from knowing
his duty, or from doing all he wishes to do, belong to God’s secret penal arrangement, and
to His unfathomable judgments, for with Him there is no iniquity. Thus we are informed
by the sure word of God of Adam’s sin; and Scripture truly declares that in him all die, and
that by him sin entered into the world, and death by sin.919 And our experience gives
abundant evidence, that in punishment for this sin our body is corrupted, and weighs down
the soul, and the clay tabernacle clogs the mind in its manifold activity;920 and we know
that we can be freed from this punishment only by gracious interposition. So the apostle
cries out in distress, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord."921 So much we know; but the
reasons for the distribution of divine judgment and mercy, why one is in this condition,
and another in that, though just, are unknown. Still, we are sure that all these things are
due either to the mercy or the judgment of God, while the measures and numbers and
weights by which the Creator of all natural productions arranges all things are concealed
from our view. For God is not the author, but He is the controller of sin; so that sinful actions,
which are sinful because they are against nature, are judged and controlled, and assigned
to their proper place and condition, in order that they may not bring discord and disgrace
on universal nature. This being the case, and as the judgments of God and the movements
of man’s will contain the hidden reason why the same prosperous circumstances which

<pb n="520"/>
some make a right use of are the ruin of others, and the same afflictions under which some
give way are profitable to others, and since the whole mortal life of man upon earth is a trial,
922 who can tell whether it may be good or bad in any particular case—in time of peace,
to reign or to serve, or to be at ease or to die—or in time of war, to command or to fight, or
to conquer or to be killed? At the same time, it remains true, that whatever is good is so by
the divine blessing, and whatever is bad is so by the divine judgment.</p>
<p>79. Let no one, then, be so daring as to make rash charges against men, not to say against
God. If the service of the ministers of the Old Testament, who were also heralds of the New,
consisted in putting sinners to death, and that of the ministers of the New Testament, who
are also interpreters of the Old, in being put to death by sinners, the service in both cases is
rendered to one God, who, varying the lesson to suit the times, teaches both that temporal
blessings are to be sought from Him, and that they are to be forsaken for Him, and that
temporal distress is both sent by Him and should be endured for Him. There was, therefore,
no cruelty in the command, or in the action of Moses, when, in his holy jealousy for his
people, whom he wished to be subject to the one true God, on learning that they had fallen
away to the worship of an idol made by their own hands, he impressed their minds at the
time with a wholesome fear, and gave them a warning for the future, by using the sword in
the punishment of a few, whose just punishment God, against whom they had sinned, appointed
in the depth of His secret judgment to be immediately inflicted. That Moses acted
as he did, not in cruelty, but in great love, may be seen from the words in which he prayed
for the sins of the people: "If Thou wilt forgive their sin, forgive it; and if not, blot me out
of Thy book."923 The pious inquirer who compares the slaughter with the prayer will find
in this the clearest evidence of the awful nature of the injury done to the soul by prostitution
to the images of devils, since such love is roused to such anger. We see the same in the
apostle, who, not in cruelty, but in love, delivered a man up to Satan for the destruction of
the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.924 Others, too, he delivered
up, that they might learn not to blaspheme.925 In the apocryphal books of the
Manichæans there is a collection of fables, published by some unknown authors under the
name of the apostles. The books would no doubt have been sanctioned by the Church at
the time of their publication, if holy and learned men then in life, and competent to determine
the matter, had thought the contents to be true. One of the stories is, that the Apostle
Thomas was once at a marriage feast in a country where he was unknown, when one of the
servants struck him, and that he forthwith by his curse brought a terrible punishment on

this man. For when he went out to the fountain to provide water for the guests, a lion fell
on him and killed him, and the hand with which he had given a slight blow to the apostle
was torn off, in fulfillment of the imprecation, and brought by a dog to the table at which
the apostle was reclining. What could be more cruel than this? And yet, if I mistake not,
the story goes on to say, that the apostle made up for the cruelty by obtaining for the man
the blessing of pardon in the next world; so that, while the people of this strange country
learned to fear the apostle as being so dear to God, the man’s eternal welfare was secured
in exchange for the loss of this mortal life. It matters not whether the story is true or false.
At any rate, the Manichæans, who regard as genuine and authentic books which the canon
of the Church rejects, must allow, as shown in the story, that the virtue of patience, which
the Lord enjoins when He says, "If any one smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him thy
left also," may be in the inward disposition, though it is not exhibited in bodily action or in
words. For when the apostle was struck, instead of turning his other side to the man, or
telling him to repeat the blow, he prayed to God to pardon his assailant in the next world,
but not to leave the injury unpunished at the time. Inwardly he preserved a kindly feeling,
while outwardly he wished the man to be punished as an example. As the Manichæans believe
this, rightly or wrongly, they may also believe that such was the intention of Moses, the
servant of God, when he cut down with the sword the makers and worshippers of the idol;
for his own words show that he so entreated for pardon for their sin of idolatry as to ask to
be blotted out of God’s book if his prayer was not heard. There is no comparison between
a stranger being struck with the hand, and the dishonor done to God by forsaking Him for
an idol, when He had brought the people out of the bondage of Egypt, had led them through
the sea, and had covered with the waters the enemy pursuing them. Nor, as regards the
punishment, is there any comparison between being killed with the sword and being torn
in pieces by wild beasts. For judges in administering the law condemn to exposure to wild
beasts worse criminals than are condemned to be put to death by the sword.</p>
<p>80. Another of Faustus’ malicious and impious charges which has to be answered, is
about the Lord’s saying to the prophet Hosea, "Take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
children of whoredoms."926 As regards this passage, the impure mind of our adversaries is
so blinded that they do not understand the plain words of the Lord in His gospel, when He
says to the Jews, "The publicans and harlots shall go into the kingdom of heaven before
you."927 There is nothing contrary to the mercifulness of truth, or inconsistent with
Christian faith, in a harlot leaving fornication, and becoming a chaste wife. Indeed, nothing
could be more unbecoming in one professing to be a prophet than not to believe that all the
sins of the fallen woman were pardoned when she changed for the better. So when the
<note type="footnote">926 Hos. i. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">927 Matt. xxi. 31.</note>

<pb n="522"/>
prophet took the harlot as his wife, it was both good for the woman to have her life amended,
and the action symbolized a truth of which we shall speak presently. But it is plain what
offends the Manichæans in this case; for their great anxiety is to prevent harlots from being
with child. It would have pleased them better that the woman should continue a prostitute,
so as not to bring their god into confinement, than that she should become the wife of one
man, and have children.</p>
<p>81. As regards Solomon, it need only be said that the condemnation of his conduct in
the faithful narrative of holy Scripture is much more serious than the childish vehemence
of Faustus’ attacks. The Scripture tells us with faithful accuracy both the good that Solomon
had at first, and the evil actions by which he lost the good he began with; while Faustus, in
his attacks, like a man closing his eyes, or with no eyes at all, seeks no guidance from the
light, but is prompted only by violent animosity. To pious and discerning readers of the
sacred Scriptures evidence of the chastity of the holy men who are said to have had several
wives is found in this, that Solomon, who by his polygamy gratified his passions, instead of
seeking for offspring, is expressly noted as chargeable with being a lover of women. This,
as we are informed by the truth which accepts no man’s person, led him down into the abyss
of idolatry.</p>
<p>82. Having now gone over all the cases in which Faustus finds fault with the Old Testament,
and having attended to the merit of each, either defending men of God against the
calumnies of carnal heretics, or, where the men were at fault, showing the excellence and
the majesty of Scripture, let us again take the cases in the order of Faustus’ accusations, and
see the meaning of the actions recorded, what they typify, and what they foretell. This we
have already done in the case of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom God said that He was
their God, as if the God of universal nature were the God of none besides them; not honoring
them with an unmeaning title, but because He, who could alone have a full and perfect
knowledge, knew the sincere and remarkable charity of these men; and because these three
patriarchs united formed a notable type of the future people of God, in not only having free
children by free women, as by Sarah, and Rebecca, and Leah, and Rachel, but also bond
children, as of this same Rebecca was born Esau, to whom it was said, "Thou shalt serve thy
brother;"928 and in having by bond women not only bond children, as by Hagar, but also
free children, as by Bilhah and Zilphah. Thus also in the people of God, those spiritually
free not only have children born into the enjoyment of liberty, like those to whom it is said,
"Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ,"929 but they have also children born into guilty
bondage, as Simon was born of Philip.930 Again, from carnal bondmen are born not only

<pb n="523"/>
children of guilty bondage, who imitate them, but also children of happy liberty, to whom
it is said, "What they say, do; but do not after their works."931 Whoever rightly observes
the fulfillment of this type in the people of God, keeps the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace, by continuing to the end in union with some, and in patient endurance of others.
Of Lot, also, we have already spoken, and have shown what the Scripture mentions as
praiseworthy in him, and what as blameworthy and the meaning of the whole narrative.</p>
<p>83. We have next to consider the prophetic significance of the action of Judah in lying
with his daughter-in-law. But, for the sake of those whose understanding is feeble, we shall
begin with observing, that in sacred Scripture evil actions are sometimes prophetic not of
evil, but of good. Divine providence preserves throughout its essential goodness, so that,
as in the example given above, from adulterous intercourse a man-child is born, a good
work of God from the evil of man, by the power of nature, and not due to the misconduct
of the parents; so in the prophetic Scriptures, where both good and evil actions are recorded,
the narrative being itself prophetic, foretells something good even by the record of what is
evil, the credit being due not to the evil-doer, but to the writer. Judah, when, to gratify his
sinful passion, he went in to Tamar, had no intention by his licentious conduct to typify
anything connected with the salvation of men, any more than Judas, who betrayed the Lord,
intended to produce any result connected with the salvation of men. So then if from the
evil deed of Judas the Lord brought the good work of our redemption by His own passion,
why should not His prophet, of whom He Himself says "He wrote of me," for the sake of
instructing us make the evil action of Judah significant of something good? Under the
guidance and inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the prophet has compiled a narrative of actions
so as to make a continuous prophecy of the things he designed to foretell. In foretelling
good, it is of no consequence whether the typical actions are good or bad. If it is written in
red ink that the Ethiopians are black, or in black ink that the Gauls are white, this circum-
stance does not affect the information which the writing conveys. No doubt, if it was a
painting instead of a writing, the wrong color would be a fault; so when human actions are
represented for example or for warning much depends on whether they are good or bad.
But when actions are related or recorded as types, the merit or demerit of the agents is a
matter of no importance, as long as there is a true typical relation between the action and
the thing signified. So in the case of Caiaphas in the Gospel as regards his iniquitous and
mischievous intention, and even as regards his words in the sense in which he used them,
that a just man should be put to death unjustly, assuredly they were bad; and yet there was
a good meaning in his words which he did not know of when he said, "It is expedient that
one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not." So it is written of
Him, "This he spake not of himself; but being the high priest, he prophesied that Jesus should
<note type="footnote">931 Matt. xxiii. 3.</note>

<pb n="524"/>
die for the people."932 In the same way the action of Judah was bad as regards his sinful
passion, but it typified a great good he knew nothing of. Of himself he did evil while it was
not of himself that he typified good. These introductory remarks apply not only to Judah,
but also to all the other cases where in the narrative of bad actions is contained a prophecy
of good.</p>
<p>84. In Tamar, then, the daughter-in-law of Judah, we see the people of the kingdom of
Judah, whose kings, answering to Tamar’s husbands, were taken from this tribe. Tamar
means bitterness; and the meaning is suitable, for this people gave the cup of gall to the
Lord.933 The two sons of Judah represent two classes of kings who governed ill—those who
did harm and those who did no good. One of these sons was evil or cruel before the Lord;
the other spilled the seed on the ground that Tamar might not become a mother. There are
only those two kinds of useless people in the world—the injurious and those who will not
give the good they have but lose it or spill it on the ground. And as injury is worse than not
doing good, the evil-doer is called the elder and the other the younger. Er, the name of the
elder, means a preparer of skins, which were the coats given to our first parents when they
were punished with expulsion from paradise.934 Onan, the name of the younger, means,
their grief; that is, the grief of those to whom he does no good, wasting the good he has on
the earth. The loss of life implied in the name of the elder is a greater evil than the want of
help implied in the name of the younger. Both being killed by God typifies the removal of
the kingdom from men of this character. The meaning of the third son of Judah not being
joined to the woman, is that for a time the kings of Judah were not of that tribe. So this
third son did not become the husband of Tamar; as Tamar represents the tribe of Judah,
which continued to exist, although the people received no king from it. Hence the name of
this son, Selom, means, his dismission. None of those types apply to the holy and righteous
men who, like David, though they lived in those times, belong properly to the New Testament,
which they served by their enlightened predictions. Again, in the time when Judah ceased
to have a king of its own tribe, the elder Herod does not count as one of the kings typified
by the husbands of Tamar; for he was a foreigner, and his union with the people was never
consecrated with the holy oil. His was the power of a stranger, given him by the Romans
and by Cæsar. And it was the same with his sons, the tetrarchs, one of whom, called Herod,
like his father, agreed with Pilate at the time of the Lord’s passion.935 So plainly were these
foreigners considered as distinct from the sacred monarchy of Judah, that the Jews themselves,
when raging against Christ, exclaimed openly, "We have no king but Cæsar."936 Nor was

<pb n="525"/>
Cæsar properly their king, except in the sense that all the world was subject to Rome. The
Jews thus condemned themselves, only to express their rejection of Christ, and to flatter
Cæsar.</p>
<p>85. The time when the kingdom was removed from the tribe of Judah was the time
appointed for the coming of Christ our Lord, the true Saviour, who should come not for
harm, but for great good. Thus was it prophesied, "A prince shall not fail from Judah, nor
a leader from his loins, till He come for whom it is reserved: He is the desire of nations."937
Not only the kingdom, but all government, of the Jews had ceased, and also, as prophesied
by Daniel, the sacred anointing from which the name Christ or Anointed is derived. Then
came He for whom it was reserved, the desire of nations; and the holy of holies was anointed
with the oil of gladness above His fellows.938 Christ was born in the time of the elder Herod,
and suffered in the time of Herod the tetrarch. He who thus came to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel was typified by Judah when he went to shear his sheep in Thamna, which
means, failing. For then the prince had failed from Judah, with all the government and
anointing of the Jews, that He might come for whom it was reserved. Judah, we are told,
came with his Adullamite shepherd, whose name was Iras; and Adullamite means, a testimony
in water. So it was with this testimony that the Lord came, having indeed greater testimony
than that of John;939 but for the sake of his feeble sheep he made use of the testimony in
water. The name Iras, too, means, vision of my brother. So John saw his brother, a brother
in the family of Abraham, and from the relationship of Mary and Elisabeth; and the same
person he recognised as his Lord and his God, for, as he himself says, he received of His
fullness.940 On account of this vision, among those born of woman, there has arisen no
greater than he;941 because, of all who foretold Christ, he alone saw what many righteous
men and prophets desired to see and saw not. He saluted Christ from the womb;942 he
knew Him more certainly from seeing the dove; and therefore, as the Adullamite, he gave
testimony by water. The Lord came to shear His sheep, in releasing them from painful
burdens, as it is said in praise of the Church in the Song of Songs, that her teeth are like a
flock of sheep after shearing.943</p>
<p>86. Next, we have Tamar changing her dress; for Tamar also means changing. Still, the
name of bitterness must be retained—not that bitterness in which gall was given to the Lord,
<note type="footnote">937 Gen. xlix. 10.</note>

<pb n="526"/>
but that in which Peter wept bitterly.944 For Judah means confession; and bitterness is
mingled with confession as a type of true repentance. It is this repentance which gives
fruitfulness to the Church established among all nations. For "it behoved Christ to suffer,
and to rise from the dead, and that repentance and the remission of sins be preached among
all nations in His name, beginning at Jerusalem."945 In the dress Tamar put on there is a
confession of sins; and Tamar sitting in this dress at the gate of Ænan or Ænaim, which
means fountain, is a type of the Church called from among the nations. She ran as a hart
to the springs of water, to meet with the seed of Abraham; and there she is made fruitful by
one who knows her not, as it is foretold, "A people whom I have not known shall serve
me."946 Tamar received under her disguise a ring, a bracelet, a staff; she is sealed in her
calling, adorned in her justification, raised in her glorification. For "whom He predestinated,
them He also called: and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified,
them He also glorified."947 This was while she was still disguised, as I have said; and in the
same state she conceives, and becomes fruitful in holiness. Also the kid promised is sent to
her as to a harlot. The kid represents rebuke for sin, and it is sent by the Adullamite already
mentioned, who, as it were, uses the reproachful words, "O generation of vipers!"948 But
this rebuke for sin does not reach her, for she has been changed by the bitterness of confession.
Afterwards, by exhibiting the pledges of the ring and bracelet and staff, she prevails
over the Jews, in their hasty judgment of her, who are now represented by Judah himself;
as at this day we hear the Jews saying that we are not the people of Christ, and have not the
seed of Abraham. But when we exhibit the sure tokens of our calling and justification and
glorification, they will immediately be confounded, and will acknowledge that we are justified
rather than they. I should enter into this more particularly, taking, as it were, each limb
and joint separately, as the Lord might enable me, were it not that such minute inquiry is
prevented by the necessity of bringing this work to a close, for it is already longer than is
desirable.</p>
<p>87. As regards the prophetic significance of David’s sin, a single word must suffice.
The names occurring in the narrative show what it typifies. David means, strong of hand,
or desirable; and what can be stronger than the Lion of the tribe of Judah, who has conquered
the world, or more desirable than He of whom the prophet says, "The desire of all nations
shall come?"949 Bersabee means, well of satisfaction, or seventh well: either of these inter-

pretations will suit our purpose. So, in the Song of Songs, the spouse, who is the Church,
is called a well of living water;950 or again, the number seven represents the Holy Spirit, as
in the number of days in Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit came from heaven. We learn also
from the book of Tobit, that Pentecost was the feast of seven weeks.951 To forty-nine, which
is seven times seven, one is added to denote unity. To this effect is the saying of the apostle:
"Bearing with one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace."952 The Church becomes a well of satisfaction by this gift of the Spirit, the number
seven denoting its spirituality; for it is in her a fountain of living water springing up unto
everlasting life, and he who has it shall never thirst.953 Uriah, Bersabee’s husband, must,
from the meaning of his name, be understood as representing the devil. It is in union to
the devil that all are bound whom the grace of God sets free, that the Church without spot
or wrinkle may be married to her true Saviour. Uriah means, my light of God; and Hittite
means, cut off, referring either to his not abiding in the truth, when he was cut off on account
of his pride from the celestial light which he had of God, or to his transforming himself into
an angel of light, because after losing his real strength by his fall, he still dares to say, My
light is of God. The literal David, then, was guilty of a heinous crime, which God by the
prophet condemned in the rebuke addressed to David, and which David atoned for by his
repentance. On the other hand, He who is the desire of all nations loved the Church when
washing herself on the roof, that is, when cleansing herself from the pollution of the world,
and in spiritual contemplation mounting above her house of clay, and trampling upon it;
and after commencing an acquaintance, He puts to death the devil, whom He first entirely
removes from her, and joins her to Himself in perpetual union. While we hate the sin, we
must not overlook the prophetical significance; and while we love, as is His due, that David
who in His mercy has freed us from the devil, we may also love the David who by the humility
of his repentance healed the wound made by his transgression.</p>
<p>88. Little need be said of Solomon, who is spoken of in Holy Scripture in terms of the
strongest disapproval and condemnation, while nothing is said of his repentance and restoration
to the divine favor. Nor can I find in his lamentable fall even a symbolical connection
with anything good. Perhaps the strange women he lusted after may be thought to represent
the Churches chosen from among the Gentiles. This idea might have been admissible, if
the women had left their gods for Solomon’s sake to worship his God. But as he for their
sakes offended his God and worshipped their gods, it seems impossible to think of any good
meaning. Doubtless, something is typified, but it is something bad, as in the case already
<note type="footnote">950 Cant. iv. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">951 Tob. ii. 1.</note>

explained of Lot’s wife and daughters. We see in Solomon a notable pre-eminence and a
notable fall. Now, this good and evil which we see in him at different periods, first good
and then evil, are in our day found together in the Church. What is good in Solomon represents,
I think, the good members of the Church; and what was bad in him represents the
bad members. Both are in one man, as the bad and the good are in the chaff and grain of
one floor, or in the tares and wheat of one field. A closer inquiry into what is said of Solomon
in Scripture might disclose, either to me or to others of greater learning and greater worth,
some more probable interpretation. But as we are now engaged on a different subject, we
must not allow this matter to break the connection of our discourse.</p>
<p>89. As regards the prophet Hosea, it is unnecessary for me to explain the meaning of
the command, or of the prophet’s conduct, when God said to him, "Go and take unto thee
a wife of whoredoms and produce children of whoredoms," for the Scripture itself informs
us of the origin and purpose of this direction. It proceeds thus: "For the land hath committed
great whoredom, departing from the Lord. So he went and took Gomer the daughter of
Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. And the Lord said unto him, Call his name
Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Judah,
and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. And it shall come to pass at that
day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. And she conceived again, and
bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name No-mercy: for I will no more have
mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. But I will have mercy
upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them
by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. Now when she had weaned
No-mercy, she conceived, and bare a son. Then said God, Call his name Not-my-people:
for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God. Yet the number of the children of Israel
shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude; and it shall come
to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be
said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. Then shall the children of Israel and the
children of Judah be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall
come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel. Say ye unto your brethren,
My people; and to your sister, She hath found mercy."954 Since the typical meaning of the
command and of the prophet’s conduct is thus explained in the same book by the Lord
Himself, and since the writings of the apostles declare the fulfillment of this prophecy in
the preaching of the New Testament, every one must accept the explanation thus given of
<note type="footnote">954 Hos. i. 2-ii. 1.</note>

<pb n="529"/>
the command and of the action of the prophet as the true explanation. Thus it is said by
the Apostle Paul, "That He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of
mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory, even us, whom He hath called, not of the
Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. As He saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people,
which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to
pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they
be called the children of the living God."955 Here Paul applies the prophecy to the Gentiles.
So also Peter, writing to the Gentiles, without naming the prophet, borrows his expressions
when he says, "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
people; that ye might show forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into
His marvellous light; which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God:
which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy." 956 From this it is plain that
the words of the prophet, "And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of
the sea, which cannot be measured for multitude," and the words immediately following,
"And it shall be that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there
they shall be called the children of the living God," do not apply to that Israel which is after
the flesh, but to that of which the apostle says to the Gentiles, "Ye therefore are the seed of
Abraham, and heirs according to the promise."957 But, as many Jews who were of the Israel
after the flesh have believed, and will yet believe; for of these were the apostles, and all the
thousands in Jerusalem of the company of the apostles, as also the churches of which Paul
speaks, when he says to the Galatians, "I was unknown by face to the churches of Judæa
which were in Christ;"958 and again, he explains the passage in the Psalms, where the Lord
is called the cornerstone,959 as referring to His uniting in Himself the two walls of circumcision
and uncircumcision, "that He might make in Himself of twain one new man, so
making peace; and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having
slain the enmity thereby: and that He might come and preach peace to them that are far
off, and to them that are nigh," that is, to the Gentiles and to the Jews; "for He is our peace,
who hath made of both one;"960 to the same purpose we find the prophet speaking of the
Jews as the children of Judah, and of the Gentiles as children of Israel, where he says, "The
children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall make to
themselves one head, and shall go up from the land." Therefore, to speak against a prophecy

<pb n="530"/>
thus confirmed by actual events, is to speak against the writings of the apostles as well as
those of the prophets; and not only to speak against writings, but to impugn in the most
reckless manner the evidence clear as noonday of established facts. In the case of the narrative
of Judah, it is perhaps not so easy to recognize, under the disguise of the woman called
Tamar, the harlot representing the Church gathered from among the corruption of Gentile
superstition; but here, where Scripture explains itself, and where the explanation is confirmed
by the writings of the apostles, instead of dwelling longer on this, we may proceed at once
to inquire into the meaning of the very things to which Faustus objects in Moses the servant
of God.</p>
<p>90. Moses killing the Egyptian in defending one of his brethren reminds us naturally
of the destruction of the devil, our assailant in this land of strangers, by our defender the
Lord Christ. And as Moses hid the dead body in the sand, even so the devil, though slain,
remains concealed in those who are not firmly settled. The Lord, we know, builds the
Church on a rock; and those who hear His word and do it, He compares to a wise man who
builds his house upon a rock, and who does not yield or give way before temptation; and
those who hear and do not, He compares to a foolish man who builds on the sand, and when
his house is tried its ruin is great.961</p>
<p>91. Of the prophetic significance of the spoiling of the Egyptians, which was done by
Moses at the command of the Lord his God, who commands nothing but what is most just,
I remember to have set down what occurred to me at the time in my book entitled On
Christian Doctrine;962 to the effect that the gold and silver and garments of the Egyptians
typified certain branches of learning which may be profitably learned or taught among the
Gentiles. This may be the true explanation; or we may suppose that the vessels of gold and
silver represent the precious souls, and the garments the bodies, of those from among the
Gentiles who join themselves to the people of God, that along with them they may be freed
from the Egypt of this world. Whatever the true interpretation may be, the pious student
of the Scriptures will feel certain that in the command, in the action, and in the narrative
there is a purpose and a symbolic meaning.</p>
<p>92. It would take too long to go through all the wars of Moses. It is enough to refer to
what has already been said, as sufficient for the purpose in this reply to Faustus of the
prophetic and symbolic character of the war with Amalek.963 There is also the charge of
cruelty made against Moses by the enemies of Scriptures, or by those who have never read
anything. Faustus does not make any specific charge, but speaks of Moses as commanding
and doing many cruel things. But, knowing the things they are in the habit of bringing

<pb n="531"/>
forward and of misrepresenting, I have already taken a particular case and have defended
it, so that any Manichæans who are willing to be corrected, and all other ignorant and irreligious
people, may see that there is no ground for their accusations. We must now inquire
into the prophetic significance of the command, that many of those who, while Moses was
absent, made an idol for themselves should be slain without regard to relationship. It is
easy to see that the slaughter of these men represents the warfare against the evil principles
which led the people into the same idolatry. Against such evil we are commanded to wage
war in the words of the psalm, "Be ye angry and sin not."964 And a similar command is
given by the apostle, when he says, "Mortify your members which are on earth fornication,
uncleanness, luxury, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry."965</p>
<p>93. It requires closer examination to see the meaning of the first action of Moses in
burning the calf in fire, and grinding it to powder, and sprinkling it in the water for the
people to drink. The tables given to him, written with the finger of God, that is, by the
agency of the Holy Spirit, he may have broken, because he judged the people unworthy of
having them read to them; and he may have burned the calf, and ground it, and scattered
it so as to be carried away by the water, in order to let nothing of it remain among the people.
But why should he have made them drink it? Every one must feel anxious to discover the
typical significance of this action. Pursuing the inquiry, we may find that in the calf there
was an embodiment of the devil, as there is in men of all nations who have the devil as their
head or leader in their impious rites. The calf is gold, because there is a semblance of wisdom
in the institution of idolatrous worship. Of this the apostle says, "Knowing God, they glorified
Him not as God, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and
their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise they became foolish, and
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of corruptible man, and of
birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things."966 From this so-called wisdom
came the golden calf, which was one of the forms of idolatry among the chief men and
professed sages of Egypt. The calf, then, represents every body or society of Gentile idolaters.
This impious society the Lord Christ burns with that fire of which He says in the Gospel, "I
am come to send fire on the earth;"967 for, as there is nothing hid from His heat,968 when
the Gentiles believe in Him they lose the form of the devil in the fire of divine influence.
Then all the body is ground, that is, after the dissolution of the combination in the membership
of iniquity comes humiliation under the word of truth. Then the dust is sprinkled in

the water, that the Israelites, that is, the preachers of the gospel, may in baptism admit those
formerly idolaters into their own body, that is, the body of Christ. To Peter, who was one
of those Israelites, it was said of the Gentiles, "Kill, and eat."969 To kill and eat is much the
same as to grind and drink. So this calf, by the fire of zeal, and the keen penetration of the
word, and the water of baptism, was swallowed up by the people, instead of their being
swallowed up by it.</p>
<p>94. Thus, when the very passages on which the heretics found their objections to the
Scriptures are studied and examined, the more obscure they are the more wonderful are the
secrets which we discover in reply to our questions; so that the mouths of blasphemers are
completely stopped, and the evidence of the truth so stifles them that they cannot even utter
a sound. The unhappy men who will not receive into their hearts the sweetness of the truth
must feel its force as a gag in their mouths. All those passages speak of Christ. The head
now ascended into heaven along with the body still suffering on earth is the full development
of the whole purpose of the authors of Scripture, which is well called Sacred Scripture. Every
part of the narrative in the prophetical books should be viewed as having a figurative
meaning, except what serves merely as a framework for the literal or figurative predictions
of this king and of his people. For as in harps and other musical instruments the musical
sound does not come from all parts of the instrument, but from the strings, and the rest is
only for fastening and stretching the strings so as to tune them, that when they are struck
by the musician they may give a pleasant sound; so in these prophetical narratives the circumstances
selected by the prophetic spirit either predict some future event, or if they have
no voice of their own, they serve to connect together other significant utterances.</p>
<p>95. Should the heretics reject our exposition of those allegorical narratives, or even insist
on understanding them only in a literal sense, to dispute about such a difference of understanding
would be as useless as to dispute about a difference of taste. Only, the fact that the
divine precepts have either a moral and religious character or a prophetic meaning must be
believed, whether intelligently or not. Moreover, the figurative interpretations must all be
in the interest of morality and religion. So, if the Manichæans or any others disagree with
our interpretation, or differ from us in method or in any particular opinion, suffice it that
the character of the fathers whom God commends for their conduct and obedience to His
precepts is vindicated on a principle which all but those inveterate in their hostility will acknowledge
to be true; and that the purity and dignity of the Scriptures are maintained in
reference to those passages which the enemies of the truth find fault with, where certain
actions are either praised or blamed, or merely narrated for us to form a judgment of them.</p>
<p>96. In fact, nothing could have been devised more likely to instruct and benefit the pious
reader of sacred Scripture than that, besides describing praiseworthy characters as examples,
<note type="footnote">969 Acts x. 13.</note>

<pb n="533"/>
and blameworthy characters as warnings, it should also narrate cases where good men have
gone back and fallen into evil, whether they are restored to the right path or continue irreclaimable;
and also where bad men have changed, and have attained to goodness, whether
they persevere in it or relapse into evil; in order that the righteous may be not lifted up in
the pride of security, nor the wicked hardened in despair of cure. And even those passages
in Scripture which contain no examples or warnings are either required for connection, so
as to pass on to essential matters, or, from their very appearance of superfluity, indicate the
presence of some secret symbolical meaning. For in the books we speak of, so far from there
being a want or a scarcity of prophetical announcements, such announcements are numerous
and distinct; and now that the fulfillment has actually taken place, the testimony thus borne
to the divine authority of the books is irresistibly strong, so that it is mere madness to suppose
that there can be any useless or unmeaning passages in books to which all classes of men
and of minds do homage, and which themselves predict what we see thus actually coming
to pass.</p>
<p>97. If, then, any one reading of the action of David, of which he repented when the
Lord rebuked and threatened him, find in the narrative an encouragement to sin, is Scripture
to be blamed for this? Is not the man’s own guilt in proportion to the abuse which he makes
for his own injury or destruction of what was written for his recovery and release? David
is set forth as a great example of repentance, because men who fall into sin either proudly
disregard the cure of repentance, or lose themselves in despair of obtaining salvation or of
meriting pardon. The example is for the benefit of the sick, not for the injury of those in
health. If madmen destroy themselves, or if evil-doers destroy others, with surgical instruments,
it is not the fault of surgery.</p>
<p>98. Even supposing that our fathers the patriarchs and prophets, of whose devout and
religious habits so good a report is given in that Scripture which every one who knows it,
and has not lost entirely the use of his reason, must admit to have been provided by God
for the salvation of men, were as lustful and cruel as the Manichæans falsely and fanatically
allege, they might still be shown to be superior not only to those whom the Manichæans
call the Elect, but also to their god himself. Is there in the licentious intercourse of man
with woman anything so bad as the self-abasement of unclouded light by mixture with
darkness? Here, is a man prompted by avarice and greed to pass off his wife as his sister
and sell her to her lover; but worse still and more shocking, that one should disguise his
own nature to gratify criminal passion, and submit gratuitously to pollution and degradation.
Why, even one who knowingly lies with his own daughters is not equally criminal with one
who lets his members share in the defilement of all sensuality as gross as this, or grosser.
And is not the Manichæan god a partaker in the contamination of the most atrocious acts
of uncleanness? Again, if it were true, as Faustus says, that Jacob went from one to another
of his four wives, not desiring offspring, but resembling a he-goat in licentiousness, he would

<pb n="534"/>
still not be sunk so low as your god, who must not only have shared in this degradation,
from his being confined in the bodies of Jacob and his wives so as to be mixed up with all
their movements, but also, in union with this very he-goat of Faustus’ coarse comparison,
must have endured all the pains of animal appetite, incurring fresh defilement at every step,
as partaking in the passion of the male, the conception of the female, and the birth of the
kid. And, in the same way, supposing Judah to have been guilty not only of fornication, but
of incest, a share in the heats and impurities of this incestuous passion would also belong
to your god. David repented of his sin in loving the wife of another, and in ordering the
death of her husband; but when will your god repent of giving up his members to the wanton
passion of the male and female chiefs of the race of darkness, and of putting to death not
the husband of his mistress, but his own children, whom he confines in the members of the
very demons who were his own lovers? Even if David had not repented, nor been thus restored
to righteousness, he would still have been better than your god. David may have
been defiled by this one act, or to the extent to which one man is capable of such defilement;
but your god suffers the pollution of his members in all such actions by whomsoever committed.
The prophet Hosea, too, is accused by Faustus: and, supposing him to have taken
the harlot to wife because he had a criminal affection for her, if he is licentious and she a
prostitute, their souls, according to your own assertion, are parts and members of your god
and of his nature. In plain language, the harlot herself must be your god. You cannot pretend
that your god is not confined in the contaminated body, or that he is only present, while
preserving entire the purity of his own nature; and you acknowledge that the members of
your god are so defiled as to require a special purification. This harlot, then, for whom you
venture to find fault with the man of God, even if she had not been changed for the better
by becoming a chaste wife, would still have been your god; at least you must admit her soul
to have been a part, however small, of your god. But one single harlot is not so bad as your
god, for he on account of his mixture with the race of darkness shares in every act of prostitution;
and wherever such impurities are perpetrated, he goes through the corresponding
experiences of abandonment, of release, and of confinement, and this from generation to
generation, till this most corrupt part reaches its final state in the mass of darkness, like an
irreclaimable harlot. Such are the evils and such the shameful abominations which your
god could not ward off from his members, and to which he was brought irresistibly by his
merciless enemy; for only by the sacrifice of his own subjects, or rather his own parts, could
he effect the destruction of his formidable assailant. Surely, there was nothing so bad as
this in killing an Egyptian so as to preserve uninjured a fellow-countryman. Yet Faustus
finds fault with this most absurdly, while with amazing infatuation he overlooks the case of
his own god. Would it not have been better for him to have carried off the gold and silver
vessels of the Egyptians, than to let his members be carried off by the race of darkness? And
yet the worshippers of this unfortunate god find fault with the servant of our God for carrying

<pb n="535"/>
on wars, in which he with his followers were always victorious, so that, under the leadership
of Moses, the children of Israel carried captive their enemies, men and women, as your god
would have done too, if he had been able. You profess to accuse Moses of doing wrong,
while in fact you envy his success. There was no cruelty in punishing with the sword those
who had sinned grievously against God. Indeed, Moses entreated pardon for this sin, even
offering to bear himself in their stead the divine anger. But even had he been cruel instead
of compassionate, he would still have been better than your god. For if any of his followers
had been sent to break the force of the enemy and had been taken captive, he would never,
if victorious, have condemned him when he had done no wrong, but acted in obedience to
orders. And yet this is what your god is to do with the part of himself which is to be fastened
in the mass of darkness, because it obeyed orders, and advanced at the risk of its own life
in defence of his kingdom against the body of the enemy. But, says the Manichæan, this
part, after mixture and combination with evil during the course of ages, has not been
obedient. But why? If the obedience was voluntary, the guilt is real, and the punishment
just. But from this it would follow that there is no nature opposed to sin; otherwise it would
not sin voluntarily; and so the whole system of Manichæism falls at once. If, again, this part
suffers from the power of this enemy against whom it was sent, and is subdued by a force
it was unable to resist, the punishment is unjust, and flagrantly cruel. The god who is defended
on the plea of necessity is a fit object of worship to those who refuse to worship the one
true God. Still, it must be allowed that, however debasing the worship of this god may be,
the worshippers are so far better than their deity, that they have an existence, while he is
nothing more than a fabulous invention. Proceed we now to the rest of Faustus’ vagaries.

<head>Book XXIII.</head>
<p>Faustus recurs to the genealogical difficulty and insists that even according to Matthew Jesus
was not Son of God until His baptism. Augustin sets forth the Catholic view of the relation
of the divine and the human in the person of Christ.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: On one occasion, when addressing a large audience, I was asked by
one of the crowd, Do you believe that Jesus was born of Mary? I replied, Which Jesus do
you mean? for in the Hebrew it is the name of several people. One was the son of Nun, the
follower of Moses;971 another was the son of Josedech the high priest;972 again, another is
spoken of as the son of David;973 and another is the Son of God.974 Of which of these do
you ask whether I believe him to have been born of Mary? His answer was, The Son of God,
of course. On what evidence, said I, oral or written, am I to believe this? He replied, On
the authority of Matthew. What, said I, did Matthew write? He replied, "The book of the
generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham" (Matt. i. 1). Then said I,
I was afraid you were going to say, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of
God; and I was prepared to correct you. Now that you have quoted the verse accurately,
you must nevertheless be advised to pay attention to the words. Matthew does not profess
to give an account of the generation of the Son of God, but of the son of David.</p>
<p>2. I will, for the present, suppose that this person was right in saying that the son of
David was born of Mary. It still remains true, that in this whole passage of the generation
no mention is made of the Son of God till we come to the baptism; so that it is an injurious
misrepresentation on your part to speak of this writer as making the Son of God the inmate
of a womb. The writer, indeed, seems to cry out against such an idea, and in the very title
of his book to clear himself of such blasphemy, asserting that the person whose birth he
describes is the son of David, not the Son of God. And if you attend to the writer’s meaning
and purpose, you will see that what he wishes us to believe of Jesus the Son of God is not so
much that He was born of Mary, as that He became the Son of God by baptism at the river
Jordan. He tells us that the person of whom he spoke at the outset as the son of David was
baptized by John, and became the Son of God on this particular occasion, when about thirty
years old, according to Luke, when also the voice was heard saying to Him, "Thou art my
Son; this day have I begotten Thee."975 It appears from this, that what was born, as is supposed,
of Mary thirty years before, was not the Son of God, but what was afterwards made

<pb n="537"/>
so by baptism at Jordan, that is, the new man, the same as in us when we were converted
from Gentile error, and believe in God. This doctrine may or may not agree with what you
call the Catholic faith; at all events, it is what Matthew says, if Matthew is the real author.
The words, Thou art my Son, this day I have begotten Thee, or, This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased, do not occur in connection with the story of Mary’s motherhood,
but with the putting away of sin at Jordan. This is what is written; and if you believe this
doctrine, you must be called a Matthæan, for you will no longer be a Catholic. The Catholic
doctrine is well known; and it is as unlike Matthew’s representations as it is unlike the truth.
In the words of your creed, you declare that you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
who was born of the Virgin Mary. According to you, therefore, the Son of God comes from
Mary; according to Matthew, from the Jordan; while we believe Him to come from God.
Thus the doctrine of Matthew, if we are right in assigning the authorship to him, is as different
from yours as from ours; only we acknowledge that he is more cautious than you in ascribing
the being born of a woman to the son of David, and not to the Son of God. As for you, your
only alternative is to deny that those statements were made, as they appear to be, by Matthew,
or to allow that you have abandoned the faith of the apostles.</p>
<p>3. For our part, while no one can alter our conviction that the Son of God comes from
God, we might indulge a credulous disposition, to the extent of admitting the fiction, that
Jesus became the Son of God at Jordan, but not that the Son of God was born of a woman.
Then, again, the son said to have been born of Mary cannot properly be called the son of
David, unless it is ascertained that he was begotten by Joseph. You say he was not, and
therefore you must allow him not to have been the son of David, even though he were the
son of Mary. The genealogy proceeds in the line of Hebrew fathers from Abraham to David,
and from David to Joseph; and as we are told that Joseph was not the real father of Jesus,
Jesus cannot be said to be the son of David. To begin with calling Jesus the son of David,
and then to go on to tell of his being born of Mary before the consummation of her marriage
with Joseph, is pure madness. And if the son of Mary cannot be called the son of David, on
account of his not being the son of Joseph, still less can the name be given to the Son of God.</p>
<p>4. Moreover, the Virgin herself appears to have belonged not to the tribe of Judah, to
which the Jewish kings belonged, and which all agree was David’s tribe, but to the priestly
tribe of Levi. This appears from the fact that the Virgin’s father Joachim was a priest; and
his name does not occur in the genealogy. How, then, can Mary be brought within the pale
of relationship to David, when she has neither father nor husband belonging to it? Consequently,
Mary’s son cannot possibly be the son of David, unless you can bring the mother
into some connection with Joseph, so as to be either his wife or his daughter.</p>
<p>5. Augustin replied: The Catholic, which is also the apostolic, doctrine, is, that our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is both the Son of God in His divine nature, and the Son of
David after the flesh. This we prove from the writings of the evangelists and apostles, so

<pb n="538"/>
that no one can reject our proofs without also rejecting these writings. Faustus’ plan is to
represent some one as saying a few words, without bringing forward any evidence in answer
to Faustus’ fertile sophistry. But with all his ingenuity, the proofs I have to give will leave
Faustus no reply, but that these passages are spurious interpolations in the sacred record,—a
reply which serves as a means of escaping, or of trying to escape, the force of the plainest
statements in Holy Scripture. We have already in this treatise sufficiently exposed the irrational
absurdity, as well as the daring profanity, of such criticism; and not to exceed all
limits, we must avoid repetition. It cannot be necessary that we should bring together all
the passages scattered throughout Scripture, which show, in answer to Faustus, that in the
books of the highest and most sacred authority He who is called the only-begotten Son of
God, even God with God, is also called the Son of David, on account of His taking the form
of a servant from the Virgin Mary, the wife of Joseph. To instance only Matthew, since
Faustus’ argument refers to this Gospel, as the whole book cannot be quoted here, let whoever
choose read it, and see how Matthew carries on to the passion and the resurrection the
narrative of Him whom He calls the Son of David in the introduction to the genealogy. Of
this same Son of David he speaks as being conceived and born of the Virgin Mary by the
Holy Ghost. He also applies to this the declaration of the prophet, "Behold, a virgin shall
conceive, and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is being interpreted,
God with us."976 Again, He who was called, even from the Virgin’s womb, Godwith-
us, is said to have heard, when He was baptized by John, a voice from heaven, saying,
"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."977 Will Faustus say that to be called
God is less than to be called the Son of God? He seems to think so, for he tries to prove that
because this voice came from heaven at the time of the baptism, therefore, according to
Matthew, He must then have become the Son of God; whereas the same evangelist, in a
previous passage, quotes the sacred announcement made by the prophet, in which the child
born of the Virgin is called God-with-us.</p>
<p>6. It is remarkable how, amid his wild irrelevancies, this wretched trifler loses no
available opportunity of darkening the declarations of Scripture by the fabulous creations
of his own fancy. Thus he says of Abraham, that when he took his handmaid to wife he
disbelieved God’s promise that he should have a child by Sarah; whereas, in fact, this
promise had not at that time been given. Then he accuses Abraham of falsehood in calling
Sarah his sister, not having read what may be learned on the authority of Scripture about
the family of Sarah. Abraham’s son Isaac also he accuses of falsely calling his wife his sister,
though a distinct account is given of her family. Then he accuses Jacob of there being a
daily quarrel among his four wives, which should be the first to appropriate him on his return
<note type="footnote">976 Isa. viii. 14, and Matt. i. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">977 Matt. iii. 17.</note>

<pb n="539"/>
from the field, while nothing of this is said in Scripture. And this is the man who pretends
to hate the writers of the sacred books for their falsehood, and who has the effrontery so to
misrepresent even the gospel record, though its authority is admitted by all as possessing
the most abundant confirmation, as to try to make it appear, not indeed that Matthew
himself,—for in that case he would have been forced to yield to apostolic authority,—but
that some one under the name of Matthew, has written about Christ what he refuses to believe,
and attempts to refute with a contumelious ingenuity!</p>
<p>7. The voice from heaven at the Jordan should be compared with the voice heard on
the Mount.978 In neither case do the words, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased," imply that He was not the Son of God before; for He who from the Virgin’s womb
took the form of a servant "was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal
with God."979 And the same Apostle Paul himself says distinctly elsewhere, "But in the
fullness of time, God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the law;"980 that is, a
woman in the Hebrew sense, not a wife, but one of the female sex. The Son of God is both
Lord of David in His divine nature, and Son of David as being of the seed of David after the
flesh. And if it were not profitable for us to believe this, the same apostle would not have
made it so prominent as he does, when he says to Timothy, "Remember that Christ Jesus,
of the seed of David, rose from the dead, according to my gospel."981 And he carefully enjoins
believers to regard as accursed whoever preaches another gospel contrary to this.</p>
<p>8. This assailant of the holy Gospel need find no difficulty in the fact that Christ is called
the Son of David, though He was born of a virgin, and though Joseph was not His real
father; while the genealogy is brought down by the evangelist Matthew, not to Mary, but to
Joseph. First of all, the husband, as the man, is the more honorable; and Joseph was Mary’s
husband, though she did not live with him, for Matthew himself mentions that she was
called Joseph’s wife by the angel; as it is also from Matthew that we learn that Mary conceived
not by Joseph, but by the Holy Spirit. But if this, instead of being a true narrative written
by Matthew the apostle, was a false narrative written by some one else under his name, is it
likely that he would have contradicted himself in such an apparent manner, and in passages
so immediately connected, as to speak of the Son of David as born of Mary without conjugal
intercourse, and then, in giving His genealogy, to bring it down to the very man with whom
the Virgin is expressly said not to have had intercourse, unless he had some reason for doing
so? Even supposing there were two writers, one calling Christ the Son of David, and giving
an account of Christ’s progenitors from David down to Joseph; while the other does not
<note type="footnote">978 Matt. xvii. 5.</note>

<note type="footnote">980 Gal. iv. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">981 2 Tim. ii. 8.</note>

<pb n="540"/>
call Christ the Son of David, and says that He was born of the Virgin Mary without intercourse
with any man; those statements are not irreconcilable, so as to prove that one or both
writers must be false. It will appear on reflection that both accounts might be true; for
Joseph might be called the husband of Mary, though she was his wife only in affection, and
in the intercourse of the mind, which is more intimate than that of the body. In this way it
might be proper that the husband of the virgin-mother of Christ should have a place in the
list of Christ’s ancestors. It might also be the case that some of David’s blood flowed in
Mary herself, so that the flesh of Christ, although produced from a virgin, still owed its origin
to David’s seed. But as, in fact, both statements are made by one and the same writer, who
informs us both that Joseph was the husband of Mary and that the mother of Christ was a
virgin, and that Christ was of the seed of David, and that Joseph is in the list of Christ’s
progenitors in the line of David, those who prefer the authority of the sacred Gospel to that
of heretical fiction must conclude that Mary was not unconnected with the family of David,
and that she was properly called the wife of Joseph, because being a woman she was in
spiritual alliance with him, though there was no bodily connection. Joseph, too, it is plain,
could not be omitted in the genealogy; for, from the superiority of his sex, such an omission
would be equivalent to a denial of his relation to the woman with whom he was inwardly
united; and believers in Christ are taught not to think carnal connection the chief thing in
marriage, as if without this they could not be man and wife, but to imitate in Christian
wedlock as closely as possible the parents of Christ, that so they may have the more intimate
union with the members of Christ.</p>
<p>9. We believe that Mary, as well as Joseph, was of the family of David, because we believe
the Scriptures, which assert both that Christ was of the seed of David after the flesh, and
that His mother was the Virgin Mary, He having no human father. Therefore, whoever
denies the relationship of Mary to David, evidently opposes the pre-eminent authority of
these passages of Scripture; and to maintain this opposition he must bring evidence in
support of his statement from writings acknowledged by the Church as canonical and
catholic, not from any writings he pleases. In the matters of which we are now treating,
only the canonical writings have any weight with us; for they only are received and acknowledged
by the Church spread over all the world, which is itself a fulfillment of the prophecies
regarding it contained in these writings. Accordingly, I am not bound to admit the uncanonical
account of Mary’s birth which Faustus adopts, that her father was a priest of the
tribe of Levi, of the name of Joachim. But even were I to admit this account, I should still
contend that Joachim must have in some way belonged to the family of David, and had
somehow been adopted from the tribe of Judah into that of Levi; or if not he, one of his
ancestors; or, at least, that while born in the tribe of Levi, he had still some relation to the
line of David; as Faustus himself acknowledges that Mary, though belonging to the tribe of
Levi, could be given to a husband of the tribe of Judah; and he expressly says that if Mary

<pb n="541"/>
were Joseph’s daughter, the name Son of David would be applicable to Christ. In this way,
by the marriage of Joseph’s daughter in the tribe of Levi, her son, though born in the tribe
of Levi, might not improperly be called the Son of David. And so, if the mother of that
Joachim, who in the passage quoted by Faustus is called the father of Mary, married in the
tribe of Levi while she belonged to the tribe of Judah and to the family of David, there would
thus be a sufficient reason for speaking of Joachim and Mary and Mary’s son as belonging
to the seed of David. If I felt obliged to pay any regard to the apocryphal scripture in which
Joachim is called the father of Mary, I should adopt some such explanation as the above,
rather than admit any falsehood in the Gospel, where it is written both that Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, and our Saviour, was of the seed of David after the flesh, and that He was
born of the Virgin Mary. It is enough for us that the enemies of these Scriptures, which record
these truths and which we believe, cannot prove against them any charge of falsehood.</p>
<p>10. Faustus cannot pretend then I am unable to prove that Mary was of the family of
David, as I have shown him unable to prove that she was not. I produce the strongest
evidence from Scriptures of established authority, which declare that Christ was of the seed
of David, and that He was born without a father of the Virgin Mary. Faustus expresses what
he considers a most becoming indignation against impropriety when he says, It is an injurious
misrepresentation of the writer to make him speak of the Son of God as the inmate of
a womb. Of course, the Catholic doctrine which teaches that Christ the Son of God was
born in the flesh of a virgin, does not make the Son of God the inmate of her womb in the
sense of having no existence beyond it, as if He had abandoned the government of heaven
and earth, or as if He had left the presence of the Father. The mistake is with the Manichæans,
whose understanding is so incapable of forming a conception of anything except what is
material, that they cannot comprehend how the Word of God, who is the virtue and wisdom
of God, while remaining in Himself and with the Father, and while governing the universe,
reaches from end to end in strength, and sweetly orders all things.982 In the faultless procedure
of this adorable providence, He appointed for Himself an earthly mother; and to
free His servants from the bondage of corruption He took in this mother the form of a servant,
that is, a mortal body; and this body which He took He showed openly, and when it
had been exposed, even to suffering and death, He raised it again from the dead, and built
again the temple which had been destroyed. You who shrink from this doctrine as blasphemous,
make the members of your god to be confined not in a virgin’s womb, but in the wombs
of all female animals, from elephants down to flies. Perhaps you think the less of the true
Christ, because the Word is said so to have become incarnate in the Virgin’s womb as to
provide a temple for Himself in human nature, while His own nature continued unaltered
in its integrity; and, on the other hand, you think the more of your god, because in the bonds

and pollution of his confinement in flesh, in the part which is to be made fast to the mass

<p>Faustus explains the Manichæan denial that man was made by God as applying to the fleshly
man not to the spiritual. Augustin elucidates the Apostle Paul’s contrasts between flesh
and spirit so as to exclude the Manichæan view.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: We are asked the reason for our denial that man is made by God. But
we do not assert that man is in no sense made by God; we only ask in what sense, and when,
and how. For, according to the apostle, there are two men, one of whom he calls sometimes
the outer man, generally the earthy, sometimes, too, the old man: the other he calls the inner
or heavenly or new man. 983 The question is, Which of these is made by God? For there
are likewise two times of our nativity; one when nature brought us forth into this light,
binding us in the bonds of flesh; and the other, when the truth regenerated us on our conversion
from error and our entrance into the faith. It is this second birth of which Jesus
speaks in the Gospel, when He says, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
of God."984 Nicodemus, not knowing what Christ meant, was at a loss, and inquired how
this could be, for an old man could not enter into his mother’s womb and be born a second
time. Jesus said in reply, "Except a man be born of water and of the Holy Spirit, he cannot
see the kingdom of God." Then He adds, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit." Hence, as the birth in which our bodies originate is not
the only birth, but there is another in which we are born again in spirit, an important
question arises from this distinction as to which of those births it is in which God makes
us. The manner of birth also is twofold. In the humiliating process of ordinary generation,
we spring from the heat of animal passion; but when we are brought into the faith, we are
formed under good instruction in honor and purity in Jesus Christ, by the Holy Spirit. For
this reason, in all religion, and especially in the Christian religion, young children are invited
to membership. This is hinted at in the words of His apostle: "My little children, of whom
I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you."985 The question, then, is not whether
God makes man, but what man He makes, and when, and how. For if it is when we are
fashioned in the womb that God forms us after His own image, which is the common belief
of Gentiles and Jews, and which is also your belief, then God makes the old man, and produces
us by means of sensual passion, which does not seem suitable to His divine nature.
But if it is when we are converted and brought to a better life that we are formed by God,
which is the general doctrine of Christ and His apostles, and which is also our doctrine, in
this case God makes us new men, and produces us in honor and purity, which would agree

perfectly with His sacred and adorable majesty. If you do not reject Paul’s authority, we
will prove to you from him what man God makes, and when, and how. He says to the
Ephesians, "That ye put off according to your former conversation the old man, which is
corrupt through deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put on the
new man, which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth."986 This shows
that in the creation of man after the image of God, it is another man that is spoken of, and
another birth, and another manner of birth. The putting off and putting on of which he
speaks, point to the time of the reception of the truth; and the assertion that the new man
is created by God implies that the old man is created neither by God nor after God. And
when he adds, that this new man is made in holiness and righteousness and truth, he thus
points to another manner of birth of which this is the character, and which, as I have said,
differs widely from the manner in which bodily generation is effected. And as he declares
that only the former is of God, it follows that the latter is not. Again, writing to the Colossians,
he uses words to the same effect: "Put off the old man with his deeds, and put on the
new man, which is renewed in the knowledge of God according to the image of Him who
created Him in you." Here he not only shows that it is the new man that God makes, but
he declares the time and manner of the formation, for the words in the knowledge of God
point to the time of believing. Then he adds, according to the image of Him who created
him, to make it clear that the old man is not the image of God, nor formed by God. Moreover,
the following words, "Where there is neither male nor female, Jew nor Greek, Barbarian nor
Scythian,"987 show more plainly still that the birth by which we are made male and female,
Greeks and Jews, Scythians and Barbarians, is not the birth in which God effects the formation
of man; but that the birth with which God has to do is that in which we lose the difference
of nation and sex and condition, and become one like Him who is one, that is, Christ. So
the same apostle says again, "As many as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ:
there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither male nor female, there is neither bond nor
free; but all are one in Christ."988 Man, then, is made by God, not when from one he is divided
into many, but when from many he becomes one. The division is in the first birth,
or that of the body; union comes by the second, which is immaterial and divine. This affords
sufficient ground for our opinion, that the birth of the body should be ascribed to nature,
and the second birth to the Supernal Majesty. So the same apostle says again to the Corinthians,
"I have begotten you in Christ Jesus by the gospel;"989 and, speaking of himself, to the
Galatians, "When it pleased Him, who separated me from my mother’s womb, to reveal His

<pb n="545"/>
Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I conferred not with
flesh and blood."990 It is plain that everywhere he speaks of the second or spiritual birth as
that in which we are made by God, as distinct from the indecency of the first birth, in which
we are on a level with other animals as regards dignity and purity, as we are conceived in
the maternal womb, and are formed, and brought forth. You may observe that in this
matter the dispute between us is not so much about a question of doctrine as of interpretation.
For you think that it is the old or outer or earthy man that is said to have been made
by God; while we apply this to the heavenly man, giving the superiority to the inner or new
man. And our opinion is not rash or groundless, for we have learned it from Christ and
His apostles, who are proved to have been the first in the world who thus taught.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: The Apostle Paul certainly uses the expression the inner man for
the spirit of the mind, and the outer man for the body and for this mortal life; but we nowhere
find him making these two different men, but one, which is all made by God, both the inner
and the outer. However, it is made in the image of God only as regards the inner, which,
besides being immaterial, is rational, and is not possessed by the lower animals. God, then,
did not make one man after His own image, and another man not after that image; but the
one man, which includes both the inner and the outer, He made after His own image, not
as regards the possession of a body and of mortal life, but as regards the rational mind with
the power of knowing God, and with the superiority as compared with all irrational creatures
which the possession of reason implies. Faustus allows that the inner man is made by God,
when, as he says, it is renewed in the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created
him. I readily admit this on the apostle’s authority. Why does not Faustus admit on the
same authority that "God has placed the members every one in the body, as it has pleased
Him"?991 Here we learn from the same apostle that God is the framer of the outer man too.
Why does Faustus take only what he thinks to be in his own favor, while he leaves out or
rejects what upsets the follies of the Manichæans? Moreover, in treating of the earthy and
the heavenly man, and making the distinction between the mortal and the immortal, between
that which we are in Adam and that which we shall be in Christ, the apostle quotes the declaration
of the law regarding the earthy or natural body, referring to the very book and the
very passage where it is written that God made the earthy man too. Speaking of the manner
in which the dead shall rise again, and of the body with which they shall come, after using
the similitude of the seeds of corn, that they are sown bare grain, and that God gives them
a body as it pleases Him, and to every seed his own body,—thus, by the way, overthrowing
the error of the Manichæans, who say that grains and plants, and all roots and shoots, are
created by the race of darkness, and not by God, who, according to them, instead of exerting
<note type="footnote">990 Gal. i. 15, 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">991 1 Cor. xii. 18.</note>

<pb n="546"/>
power in the production of these objects, is Himself subject to confinement in them,—he
goes on, after this refutation of Manichæan impieties, to describe the different kinds of
flesh. "All flesh," he says, "is not the same flesh." Then he speaks of celestial and terrestrial
bodies, and then of the change of our body by which it will become spiritual and heavenly.
"It is sown," he says, "in dishonor, it shall rise in glory; it is sown in weakness, it shall rise in
power; it is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body." Then, in order to show the
origin of the animal body, he says, "There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body; as
it is written, The first man, Adam, was made a living soul."992 Now this is written in Genesis,
993 where it is related how God made man, and animated the body which He had formed
of the earth. By the old man the apostle simply means the old life, which is a life in sin, and
is after the manner of Adam, of whom it is said, "By one man sin entered into the world,
and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned."994 Thus the
whole of this man, both the inner and the outer part, has become old because of sin, and liable
to the punishment of mortality. There is, however, a restoration of the inner man, when it
is renewed after the image of its Creator, in the putting off of unrighteousness—that is, the
old man, and putting on righteousness—that is, the new man. But when that which is sown
a natural body shall rise a spiritual body, the outer man too shall attain the dignity of a celestial
character; so that all that has been created may be created anew, and all that has been
made be remade by the Creator and Maker Himself. This is briefly explained in the words:
"The body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the
Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from
the dead will also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit dwelling in you." 995 No one
instructed in the Catholic doctrine but knows that it is in the body that some are male and
some female, not in the spirit of the mind, in which we are renewed after the image of God.
But elsewhere the apostle teaches that God is the Maker of both; for he says, "Neither is the
woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord; for as the woman
is of the man, so is the man by the woman; but all things are of God."996 The only reply
given to this, by the perverse stupidity of those who are alienated from the life of God by
the ignorance which is in them, on account of the blindness of their heart, is, that whatever
pleases them in the apostolic writings is true, and whatever displeases them is false. This is
the insanity of the Manichæans, who will be wise if they cease to be Manichæans. As it is,
if they are asked whether it is He that remakes and renews the inner man (which they ac-

knowledge to be renewed after the image of God, and they themselves quote the passage in
support of this; and, according to Faustus, God makes man when the inner man is renewed
in the image of God), they will answer, yes. And if we then go on to ask when God made
what He now renews, they must devise some subterfuge to prevent the exposure of their
absurdities. For, according to them, the inner man is not formed or created or originated
by God, but is part of His own substance sent against His enemies; and instead of becoming
old by sin, it is through necessity captured and damaged by the enemy. Not to repeat all
the nonsense they talk, the first man they speak of is not the man of the earth earthy that
the apostle speaks of,997 but an invention proceeding from their own magazine of untruths.
Faustus, though he chooses man as a subject for discussion, says not a word of this first
man; for he is afraid that his opponents in the discussion might come to know something
about him.</p>

<p>Faustus seeks to bring into ridicule the orthodox claim to believe in the infinity of God by caricaturing
the anthropomorphic representations of the Old Testament. Augustin expresses
his despair of being able to induce the Manichæans to adopt right views of the infinitude
of God so long as they continue to regard the soul and God as extended in space.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Is God finite or infinite? He must be finite unless you are mistaken in
addressing Him as the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob; unless, indeed, the being thus
addressed is different from the God you call infinite. In the case of the God of Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob, the mark of circumcision, which separated these men from fellowship
with other people, marked also the limit of God’s power as extending only to them. And a
being whose power is finite cannot himself be infinite. Moreover, in this address, you do
not mention even the ancients before Abraham, such as Enoch, Noah, and Shem, and others
like them, whom you allow to have been righteous though in uncircumcision; but because
they lacked this distinguishing mark, you will not call God their God, but only of Abraham
and his seed. Now, if God is one and infinite, what need of such careful particularity in
addressing Him, as if it was not enough to name God, without adding whose God He
is—Abraham’s, namely, and Isaac’s and Jacob’s; as if Abraham were a landmark to steer by
in your invocation, to escape shipwreck among a shoal of deities? The Jews, who are circumcised,
may very properly address this deity, as having a reason for it, because they call God
the God of circumcision, in contrast to the gods of uncircumcision. But why you should
do the same, it is difficult to understand; for you do not pretend to have Abraham’s sign,
though you invoke his God. If we understand the matter rightly, the Jews and their God
seem to have set marks upon one another for the purpose of recognition, that they might
not lose each other. So God gave them the disgusting mark of circumcision, that, in whatever
land or among whatever people they might be, they might by being circumcised be known
to be His. They again marked God by calling Him the God of their fathers, that, wherever
He might be, though among a crowd of gods, He might, on hearing the name God of Abraham,
God of Isaac, God of Jacob, know at once that He was addressed. So we often see, in
a number of people of the same name, that no one answers till called by his surname. In
the same way the shepherd or herdsman makes use of a brand to prevent his property being
taken by others. In thus marking God by calling Him the God of Abraham and Isaac and
Jacob, you show not only that He is finite, but also that you have no connection with Him,
because you have not the mark of circumcision by which He recognizes His own. Therefore,
if this is the God you worship, there can be no doubt of His being finite. But if you say that
God is infinite, you must first of all give up this finite deity, and by altering your invocation,
show your penitence for your past errors. We have thus proved God to be finite, taking you
on your own ground. But to determine whether the supreme and true God is infinite or

<pb n="549"/>
not, we need only refer to the opposition between good and evil. If evil does not exist, then
certainly God is infinite; otherwise He must be finite. Evil, however, undoubtedly exists;
therefore God is not infinite. It is where good stops that evil begins.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: No one that knows you would dream of asking you about the infinitude
of God, or of discussing the matter with you. For, before there can be any degree
of spirituality in any of your conceptions, you must first have your minds cleared by simple
faith, and by some elementary knowledge, from the illusions of carnal and material ideas.
This your heresy prevents you from doing, for it invariably represents the body and the soul
and God as extended in space, either finite or infinite, while the idea of space is applicable
only to the body. As long as this is the case, it will be better for you to leave this matter
alone; for you can teach no truth regarding it, any more than in other matters; and in this
you are unfit for learning, as you might do in other things, if you were not proud and
quarrelsome. For in such questions as how God can be finite, when no space can contain
Him; how He can be infinite, when the Son knows Him perfectly; how He can be finite, and
yet unbounded; how He can be infinite, and yet perfect; how He can be finite, who is without
measure; how He can be infinite, who is the measure of all things—all carnal ideas go for
nothing; and if the carnality is to be removed, it must first become ashamed of itself. Accordingly,
your best way of ending the matter you have brought forward of God as finite or
infinite, is to say no more about it till you cease going so far astray from Christ, who is the
end of the law. Of the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob we have already said enough
to show why He who is the true God of all creatures wished to be familiarly known by His
people under this name. On circumcision, too, we have already spoken in several places in
answer to ignorant reproaches. The Manichæans would find nothing to ridicule in this sign
if they would view it as appointed by God, to be an appropriate symbol of the putting off of
the flesh. They ought thus to consider the rite with a Christian instead of a heretical mind;
as it is written, "To the pure all things are pure." But, considering the truth of the following
words, "To the unclean and unbelieving nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience
are defiled,"998 we must remind our witty opponents, that if circumcision is indecent, as
they say it is, they should rather weep than laugh at it; for their god is exposed to restraint
and contamination in conjunction both with the skin which is cut and with the blood which
is shed.</p>

<p>Faustus insists that Jesus might have died though not born, by the exercise of divine power,
yet he rejects birth and death alike. Augustin maintains that there are some things that
even God cannot do, one of which is to die. He refutes the docetism of the Manichæans.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You ask, If Jesus was not born, how did He die? Well this is a probability,
such as one makes use of in want of proofs. We will, however, answer the question by
examples taken from what you generally believe. If they are true, they will prove our case;
if they are false, they will help you no more than they will us. You say then, How could Jesus
die, if He were not man? In return, I ask you, How did Elias not die, though he was a man?
Could a mortal encroach upon the limits of immortality, and could not Christ add to His
immortality whatever experience of death was required? If Elias, contrary to nature, lives
for ever, why not allow that Jesus, with no greater contrariety to nature, could remain in
death for three days? Besides that, it is not only Elias, but Moses and Enoch you believe to
be immortal, and to have been taken up with their bodies to heaven. Accordingly, if it is a
good argument that Jesus was a man because He died, it is an equally good argument that
Elias was not a man because he did not die. But as it is false that Elias was not a man, notwithstanding
his supposed immortality, so it is false that Jesus was a man, though He is
considered to have died. The truth is, if you will believe it, that the Hebrews were in a mistake
regarding both the death of Jesus and the immortality of Elias. For it is equally untrue that
Jesus died and that Elias did not die. But you believe whatever you please; and for the rest,
you appeal to nature. And, allowing this appeal, nature is against both the death of the immortal
and the immortality of the mortal. And if we refer to the power of effecting their
purpose as possessed by God and by man, it seems more possible for Jesus to die than for
Elias not to die; for the power of Jesus is greater than that of Elias. But if you exalt the
weaker to heaven, though nature is against it, and, forgetting his condition as a mortal, endow
him with eternal felicity, why should I not admit that Jesus could die if He pleased, even
though I were to grant His death to have been real, and not a mere semblance? For, as from
the outset of His taking the likeness of man He underwent in appearance all the experiences
of humanity, it was quite consistent that He should complete the system by appearing to
die.</p>
<p>2. Moreover, it is to be remembered that this reference to what nature grants as possible,
should be made in connection with all the history of Jesus, and not only with His death.
According to nature, it is impossible that a man blind from his birth should see the light;
and yet Jesus appears to have performed a miracle of this kind, so that the Jews themselves
exclaimed that from the beginning of the world it was not seen that one opened the eyes of
a man born blind.999 So also healing a withered hand, giving the power of utterance and
<note type="footnote">999 John ix.</note>

<pb n="551"/>
expression to those born dumb, restoring animation to the dead, with the recovery of their
bodily frame after dissolution had begun, produce a feeling of amazement, and must seem
utterly incredible in view of what is naturally possible and impossible. And yet, as Christians,
we believe all the things to have been done by the same person; for we regard not the law
of nature, but the powerful operation of God. There is a story, too, of Jesus having been
cast from the brow of a hill, and having escaped unhurt. If, then, when thrown down from
a height He did not die, simply because He chose not to die, why should He not have had
the power to die when He pleased? We take this way of answering you because you have a
fancy for discussion, and affect to use logical weapons not properly belonging to you. As
regards our own belief, it is no more true that Jesus died than that Elias is immortal.</p>
<p>3. Augustin replied: As to Enoch and Elias and Moses, our belief is determined not by
Faustus’ suppositions, but by the declarations of Scripture, resting as they do on foundations
of the strongest and surest evidence. People in error, as you are, are unfit to decide what is
natural, and what contrary to nature. We admit that what is contrary to the ordinary course
of human experience is commonly spoken of as contrary to nature. Thus the apostle uses
the words, "If thou art cut out of the wild olive, and engrafted contrary to nature in the good
olive."1000 Contrary to nature is here used in the sense of contrary to human experience of
the course of nature; as that a wild olive engrafted in a good olive should bring forth the
fatness of the olive instead of wild berries. But God, the Author and Creator of all natures,
does nothing contrary to nature; for whatever is done by Him who appoints all natural order
and measure and proportion must be natural in every case. And man himself acts contrary
to nature only when he sins; and then by punishment he is brought back to nature again.
The natural order of justice requires either that sin should not be committed or that it should
not go unpunished. In either case, the natural order is preserved, if not by the soul, at least
by God. For sin pains the conscience, and brings grief on the mind of the sinner, by the
loss of the light of justice, even should no physical sufferings follow, which are inflicted for
correction, or are reserved for the incorrigible. There is, however, no impropriety in saying
that God does a thing contrary to nature, when it is contrary to what we know of nature.
For we give the name nature to the usual common course of nature; and whatever God does
contrary to this, we call a prodigy, or a miracle. But against the supreme law of nature,
which is beyond the knowledge both of the ungodly and of weak believers, God never acts,
any more than He acts against Himself. As regards spiritual and rational beings, to which
class the human soul belongs, the more they partake of this unchangeable law and light, the
more clearly they see what is possible, and what impossible; and again, the greater their
distance from it, the less their perception of the future, and the more frequent their surprise
at strange occurrences.</p>
<note type="footnote">1000 Rom. xi. 24.</note>

<pb n="552"/>
<p>4. Thus of what happened to Elias we are ignorant; but still we believe the truthful declarations
of Scripture regarding him. Of one thing we are certain, that what God willed
happened, and that except by God’s will nothing can happen to any one. So, if I am told
that it is possible that the flesh of a certain man shall be changed into a celestial body, I allow
the possibility, but I cannot tell whether it will be done; and the reason of my ignorance is,
that I am not acquainted with the will of God in the matter. That it will be done if it is God’s
will, is perfectly clear and indubitable. Again, if I am told that something would happen if
God did not prevent it from happening, I reply confidently that what is to happen is the
action of God, not the event which might otherwise have happened. For God knows His
own future action, and therefore He knows also the effect of that action in preventing the
happening of what would otherwise have happened; and, beyond all question, what God
knows is more certain than what man thinks. Hence it is as impossible for what is future
not to happen, as for what is past not to have happened; for it can never be God’s will that
anything should, in the same sense, be both true and false. Therefore all that is properly
future cannot but happen; what does not happen never was future; even as all things which
are properly in the past did indubitably take place.</p>
<p>5. Accordingly, to say, if God is almighty, let Him make what has been done to be undone,
is in fact to say, if God is almighty, let Him make a thing to be in the same sense both
true and false. God can put an end to the existence of anything, when the thing to be put
an end to has a present existence; as when He puts an end by death to the existence of any
one who has been brought into existence in birth; for in this case there is an actual existence
which may be put a stop to. But when a thing does not exist, the existence cannot be put a
stop to. Now, what is past no longer exists and whatever has an existence which can be put
an end to cannot be past. What is truly past is no longer present; and the truth of its past
existence is in our judgment, not in the thing itself which no longer exists. The proposition
asserting anything to be past is true when the thing no longer exists. God cannot make such
a proposition false, because He cannot contradict the truth. The truth in this case, or the
true judgment, is first of all in our own mind, when we know and give expression to it. But
should it disappear from our minds by our forgetting it, it would still remain as truth. It
will always be true that the past thing which is no longer present had an existence; and the
truth of its past existence after it has stopped is the same as the truth of its future existence
before it began to be. This truth cannot be contradicted by God, in whom abides the supreme
and unchangeable truth, and whose illumination is the source of all the truth to be found
in any mind or understanding. Now God is not omnipotent in the sense of being able to
die; nor does this inability prevent His being omnipotent. True omnipotence belongs to
Him who truly exists, and who alone is the source of all existence, both spiritual and corporeal.
The Creator makes what use He pleases of all His creatures; and His pleasure is in harmony
with true and unchangeable justice, by which, as by His own nature, He, Himself

<pb n="553"/>
unchangeable, brings to pass the changes of all changeable things according to the desert
of their natures or of their actions. No one, therefore, would be so foolish as to deny that
Elias being a creature of God could be changed either for the worse or for the better; or that
by the will of the omnipotent God he could be changed in a manner unusual among men.
So we can have no reason for doubting what on the high authority of Scripture is related of
him, unless we limit the power of God to things which we are familiar with.</p>
<p>6. Faustus’ argument is, If Elias who was a man could escape death, why might not
Christ have the power of dying, since He was more than man? This is the same as to say,
If human nature can be changed for the better, why should not the divine nature be changed
for the worse?—a weak argument, seeing that human nature is changeable, while the divine
nature is not. Such a method of inference would lead to the glaring absurdity, that if God
can bestow eternal glory on man, He must also have the power of consigning Himself to
eternal misery. Faustus will reply that his argument refers only to three days of death for
God, as compared with eternal life for man. Well, if you understood the three days of death
in the sense of the death of the flesh which God took as a part of our mortal nature, you
would be quite correct; for the truth of the gospel makes known that the death of Christ for
three days was for the eternal life of men. But in arguing that there is no impropriety in
asserting a death of three days of the divine nature itself, without any assumption of mortality,
because human nature can be endowed with immortality, you display the folly of one who
knows neither God nor the gifts of God. And indeed, since you make part of your god to
be fastened to the mass of darkness for ever, how can you escape the absurd conclusion
already mentioned, that God consigns Himself to eternal misery? You will then require to
prove that part of light is light, while part of God is not God. To give you in a word, without
argument, the true reason of our faith, as regards Elias having been caught up to heaven
from the earth, though only a man, and as regards Christ being truly born of a virgin, and
truly dying on the cross, our belief in both cases is grounded on the declaration of Holy
Scripture,1001 which it is piety to believe, and impiety to disbelieve. What is said of Elias
you pretend to deny, for you will pretend anything. Regarding Christ, although even you
do not go the length of saying that He could not die, though He could be born, still you
deny His birth from a virgin, and assert His death on the cross to have been feigned, which
is equivalent to denying it too, except as a mockery for the delusion of men; and you allow
so much merely to obtain indulgence for your own falsehoods from the believers in these
fictions.</p>
<p>7. The question which Faustus makes it appear that he is asked by a Catholic, If Jesus
was not born, how could He die? could be asked only by one who overlooked the fact that
Adam died, though he was not born. Who will venture to say that the Son of God could
<note type="footnote">1001 2 Kings ii. 11; Matt. i. 25, xvii. 50.</note>

<pb n="554"/>
not, if He had pleased, have made for Himself a true human body in the same way as He
did for Adam; for all things were made by Him?1002 or who will deny that He who is the
Almighty Son of the Almighty could, if He had chosen, have taken a body from a heavenly
substance, or from air or vapor, and have so changed it into the precise character of a human
body, as that He might have lived as a man, and have died in it? Or, once more, if He had
chosen to take a body of none of the material substances which He had made, but to create
for Himself from nothing real flesh, as all things were created by Him from nothing, none
of us will oppose this by saying that He could not have done it. The reason of our believing
Him to have been born of the Virgin Mary, is not that He could not otherwise have appeared
among men in a true body, but because it is so written in the Scripture, which we must believe
in order to be Christians, or to be saved. We believe, then, that Christ was born of the Virgin
Mary, because it is so written in the Gospel; we believe that He died on the cross, because
it is so written in the Gospel; we believe that both His birth and death were real, because the
Gospel is no fiction. Why He chose to suffer all these things in a body taken from a woman
is a matter known only to Himself. Perhaps He took this way of giving importance and
honor to both the sexes which He had created, taking the form of a man, and being born of
a woman; or there may have been some other reason, we cannot tell. But this may be confidently
affirmed, that what took place was exactly as we are told in the Gospel narrative,
and that what the wisdom of God determined upon was exactly what ought to have
happened. We place the authority of the Gospel above all heretical discussions; and we admire
the counsel of divine wisdom more than any counsel of any creature.</p>
<p>8. Faustus calls upon us to believe him, and says, The truth is, if you will believe it, that
the Hebrews were in a mistake regarding both the death of Jesus and the immortality of
Elias. And a little after he adds, As from the outset of His taking the likeness of man He
underwent in appearance all the experiences of humanity, it was quite consistent that He
should seal the dispensation by appearing to die. How can this infamous liar, who declares
that Christ feigned death, expect to be believed? Did Christ utter falsehood when He said,
"It behoves the Son of man to be killed, and to rise the third day?"1003 And do you tell us
to believe what you say, as if you utter no falsehoods? In that case, Peter was more truthful
than Christ when he said to Him, "Be it far from Thee, Lord; this shall not be unto Thee;"
for which it was said to him, "Get thee behind me, Satan."1004 This rebuke was not lost
upon Peter, for, after his correction and full preparation, he preached even to his own death
the truth of the death of Christ. But if Peter deserved to be called Satan for thinking that

<pb n="555"/>
Christ would not die, what should you be called, when you not only deny that Christ died,
but assert that He feigned death? You give, as a reason for Christ’s appearing to die, that
He underwent in appearance all the experiences of humanity. But that He feigned all the
experiences of humanity is only your opinion in opposition to the Gospel. In reality, when
the evangelist says that Jesus slept,1005 that He was hungry,1006 that He was thirsty,1007 that
He was sorrowful,1008 or glad, and so on,—these things are all true in the senseof not being
feigned, but actual experiences; only that they were undergone, not from a mere natural
necessity, but in the exercise of a controlling will, and of divine power. In the case of a man,
anger, sorrow, sleeping, being hungry and thirsty, are often involuntary; in Christ they were
acts of His own will. So also men are born without any act of their own will, and suffer
against their will; while Christ was born and suffered by His own will. Still, the things are
true; and the accurate narrative of them is intended to instruct whoever believes in Christ’s
gospel in the truth, not to delude him with falsehoods.</p>

<p>Faustus warns against pressing too far the argument, that if Jesus was not born He cannot
have suffered. Augustin accepts the birth and death alike on the testimony of the Gospel
narrative, which is higher authority than the falsehood of Manichæus.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: If Jesus was not born, He cannot have suffered; but since He did suffer,
He must have been born. I advise you not to have recourse to logical inference in these
matters, or else your whole faith will be shaken. For, even according to you, Jesus was born
miraculously of a virgin; which the argument from consequents to antecedents shows to be
false. For your argument might thus be turned against you: If Jesus was born of a woman,
He must have been begotten by a man; but He was not begotten by a man, therefore He was
not born of a woman. If, as you believe, He could be born without being begotten, why
could He not also suffer without being brought forth?</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: The argument which you here reply to is one which could be used
only by such ignorant people as you succeed in misleading, not by those who know enough
to refute you. Jesus could both be born without being begotten and suffer without being
brought forth. His being one and not the other was the effect of His own will. He chose to
be born without being begotten, and not to suffer without being brought forth. And if you
ask how I know that He was brought forth, and that He suffered, I read this in the faithful
Gospel narrative. If I ask how you know what you state, you bring forward the authority
of Manichæus, and charge the Gospel with falsehood. Even if Manichæus did not set forth
falsehood as an excellence in Christ, I should not believe his statements. His praise of
falsehood comes from nothing that he found in Christ, but from his own moral character.</p>

<head>Book XXVIII.</head>
<p>Faustus recurs to the genealogy and insists upon examining it as regards its consistency with
itself. Augustin takes his stand on Scripture authority and maintains that Matthew’s
statements as to the birth of Christ must be accepted as final.ö</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: Christ, you say, could not have died, had He not been born. I reply,
If He was born, He cannot have been God; or if He could both be God and be born, why
could He not both be born and die? Plainly, arguments and necessary consequences are
not applicable to those matters, where the question is of the account to be given of Jesus.
The answer must be obtained from His own statements, or from the statements of His
apostles regarding Him. The genealogy must be examined as regards its consistency with
itself, instead of arguing from the supposition of Christ’s death to the fact of His birth; for
He might have suffered without having been born, or He might have been born, and yet
never have suffered; for you yourselves acknowledge that with God nothing is impossible,
which is inconsistent with the denial that Christ could have suffered without having been
born.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: You are always answering arguments which no one uses, instead
of our real arguments, which you cannot answer. No one says that Christ could not die if
He had not been born; for Adam died though he had not been born. What we say is, Christ
was born, because this is said not by this or that heretic, but in the holy Gospel; and He died,
for this too is written, not in some heretical production, but in the holy Gospel. You set
aside argument on the question of the true account to be given of Jesus, and refer to what
He says of Himself, and what His apostles say of Him; and yet, when I begin to quote the
Gospel of His apostle Matthew, where we have the whole narrative of Christ’s birth, you
forthwith deny that Matthew wrote the narrative, though this is affirmed by the continuous
testimony of the whole Church, from the days of apostolic presidency to the bishops of our
own time. What authority will you quote against this? Perhaps some book of Manichæus,
where it is denied that Jesus was born of a virgin. As, then, I believe your book to be the
production of Manichæus, since it has been kept and handed down among the disciples of
Manichæus, from the time when he lived to the present time, by a regular succession of
your presidents, so I ask you to believe the book which I quote to have been written by
Matthew, since it has been handed down from the days of Matthew in the Church, without
any break in the connection between that time and the present. The question then is,
whether we are to believe the statements of an apostle who was in the company of Christ
while He was on earth, or of a man away in Persia, born long after Christ. But perhaps you
will quote some other book bearing the name of an apostle known to have been chosen by
Christ; and you will find there that Christ was not born of Mary. Since, then, one of the
books must be false, the question in this case is, whether we are to yield our belief to a book

<pb n="558"/>
acknowledged and approved as handed down from the beginning in the Church founded
by Christ Himself, and maintained through the apostles and their successors in an unbroken
connection all over the world to the present day; or to a book which this Church condemns
as unknown, and which, moreover, is brought forward by men who prove their veracity by
praising Christ for falsehood.</p>
<p>3. Here you will say, Examine the genealogy as given in the two Gospels, and see if it
is consistent with itself. The answer to this has been given already.1009 Your difficulty is
how Joseph could have two fathers. But even if you could not have thought of the explanation,
that one was his own father, and the other adopted, you should not have been so ready
to put yourself in opposition to such high authority. Now that this explanation has been
given you, I call upon you to acknowledge the truth of the Gospel, and above all to cease
your mischievous and unreasonable attacks upon the truth.</p>
<p>4. Faustus most plausibly refers to what Jesus said of Himself. But how is this to be
known except from the narratives of His disciples? And if we do not believe them when
they tell us that Christ was born of a virgin, how shall we believe what they record as said
by Christ of Himself? For, as regards any writing professing to come immediately from
Christ Himself, if it were really His, how is it not read and acknowledged and regarded as
of supreme authority in the Church, which, beginning with Christ Himself, and continued
by His apostles, who were succeeded by the bishops, has been maintained and extended to
our own day, and in which is found the fulfillment of many former predictions, while those
concerning the last days are sure to be accomplished in the future? In regard to the appearance
of such a writing, it would require to be considered from what quarter it issued. Supposing
it to have issued from Christ Himself, those in immediate connection with Him
might very well have received it, and have transmitted it to others. In this case, the authority
of the writing would be fully established by the traditions of various communities, and of
their presidents, as I have already said. Who, then, is so infatuated as in our day to believe
that the Epistle of Christ issued by Manichæus is genuine, or to disbelieve Matthew’s narrative
of Christ’s words and actions? Or, if the question is of Matthew being the real author, who
would not, in this also, believe what he finds in the Church, which has a distinct history in
unbroken connection from the days of Matthew to the present time, rather than a Persian
interloper, who comes more than two hundred years after, and wishes us to believe his account
of Christ’s words and actions rather than that of Matthew; whereas, even in the case
of the Apostle Paul, who was called from heaven after the Lord’s ascension, the Church
would not have believed him, had there not been apostles in life with whom he might
communicate, and compare his gospel with theirs, so as to be recognized as belonging to
the same society? When it was ascertained that Paul preached what the apostles preached,
<note type="footnote">1009 III. 3.</note>

<pb n="559"/>
and that he lived in fellowship and harmony with them, and when God’s testimony was
added by Paul’s working miracles like those done by the apostles, his authority became so
great, that his words are now received in the Church, as if, to use his own appropriate words,
Christ were speaking in him.1010 Manichæus, on the other hand, thinks that the Church
of Christ should believe what he says in opposition to the Scriptures, which are supported
by such strong and continuous evidence, and in which the Church finds an emphatic injunction,
that whoever preaches to her differently from what she has received must be anathema.
1011</p>
<p>5. Faustus tells us that he has good grounds for concluding that these Scriptures are
unworthy of credit. And yet he speaks of not using arguments. But the argument too shall
be refuted. The end of the whole argument is to bring the soul to believe that the reason of
its misery in this world is, that it is the means of preventing God from being deprived of
His kingdom, and that God’s substance and nature is so exposed to change, corruption, injury,
and contamination, that part of it is incurably defiled, and is consigned by Himself to
eternal punishment in the mass of darkness, though, when it was in harmless union with
Himself, and guilty of no crime, He knowingly sent it where it was to suffer defilement.
This is the end of all your arguments and fictions; and would that there were an end of them
as regards your heart and your lips, that you might sometime desist from believing and uttering
those execrable blasphemies! But, says Faustus, I prove from the writings themselves
that they cannot be in all points trustworthy, for they contradict one another. Why not say,
then, that they are wholly untrustworthy, if their testimony is inconsistent and self-contradictory?
But, says Faustus, I say what I think to be in accordance with truth. With what
truth? The truth is only your own fiction, which begins with God’s battle, goes on to His
contamination, and ends with His damnation. No one, says Faustus, believes writings which
contradict themselves. But if you think they do this, it is because you do not understand
them; for your ignorance has been manifested in regard to the passages you have quoted in
support of your opinion, and the same will appear in regard to any quotations you may still
make. So there is no reason for our not believing these writings, supported as they are by
such weighty testimony; and this is itself the best reason for pronouncing accursed those
whose preaching differs from what is there written.</p>

<head>Book XXIX.</head>
<p>Faustus seeks to justify the docetism of the Manichæans. Augustin insists that there is nothing
disgraceful in being born.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: If Christ was visible, and suffered without having been born, this was
sorcery. This argument of yours may be turned against you, by replying that it was sorcery
if He was conceived or brought forth without being begotten. It is not in accordance with
the law of nature that a virgin should bring forth, and still less that she should still be a virgin
after bringing forth. Why, then, do you refuse to admit that Christ, in a preternatural
manner, suffered without submitting to the condition of birth? Believe me: in substance,
both our beliefs are contrary to nature; but our belief is decent, and yours is not. We give
an explanation of Christ’s passion which is at least probable, while the only explanation you
give of His birth is false. In fine, we hold that He suffered in appearance, and did not really
die; you believe in an actual birth, and conception in the womb. If it is not so, you have
only to acknowledge that the birth too was a delusion, and our whole dispute will be at an
end. As to what you frequently allege, that Christ could not have appeared or spoken to
men without having been born, it is absurd; for, as our teachers have shown, angels have
often appeared and spoken to men.</p>
<p>2. Augustin replied: We do not say that to die without having been born is sorcery;
for, as we have said already, this happened in the case of Adam. But, though it had never
happened, who will venture to say that Christ could not, if He had so pleased, have come
without taking His body from a virgin, and yet appearing in a true body to redeem us by a
true death? However, it was better that He should be, as He actually was, born of a virgin,
and, by His condescension, do honor to both sexes, for whose deliverance He was to die,
by taking a man’s body born of a woman. In this He testifies emphatically against you, and
refutes your doctrine, which makes the sexes the work of the devil. What we call sorcery in
your doctrine is your making Christ’s passion and death to have been only in appearance,
so that, by a spectral illusion, He seemed to die when He did not. Hence you must also
make His resurrection spectral and illusory and false; for if there was no true death, there
could not be a real resurrection. Hence also the marks which He showed to His doubting
disciples must have been false; and Thomas was not assured by truth, but cheated by a lie,
when he exclaimed, "My Lord, and my God."1012 And yet you would have us believe that
your tongue utters truth, though Christ’s whole body was a falsehood. Our argument against
you is, that the Christ you make is such that you cannot be His true disciples unless you too
practise deceit. The fact that Christ’s body was the only one born of a virgin does not prove
that there was sorcery in His birth, any more than there is sorcery in its being the only body
<note type="footnote">1012 John xx. 28.</note>

<pb n="561"/>
to rise again on the third day, never to die any more. Will you say that there was sorcery in
all the Lord’s miracles because they were unusual? They really happened, and their appearance,
as seen by men, was true, and not an illusion; and when they are said to be contrary
to nature, it is not that they oppose nature, but that they transcend the method of nature to
which we are accustomed. May God keep the minds of His people who are still babes in
Christ from being influenced by Faustus, when he recommends as a duty that we should
acknowledge Christ’s birth to have been illusory and not real, that so we may end our dispute!
Nay, verily, rather let us continue to contend for the truth against them, than agree with
them in falsehood.</p>
<p>3. But if we are to end the controversy by saying this, why do not our opponents
themselves say it? While they assert the death of Christ to have been not real but feigned,
why do they make out that He had no birth at all, not even of the same kind as His death?
If they had so much regard for the authority of the evangelist as to oblige them to admit
that Christ suffered, at least in appearance, it is the same authority which testifies to His
birth. Two evangelists, indeed, give the story of the birth;1013 but in all we read of Jesus
having a mother.1014 Perhaps Faustus was unwilling to make the birth an illusion, because
the difference of the genealogies given in Matthew and Luke causes an apparent discrepancy.
But, supposing a man ignorant, there are many things also relating to the passion of Christ
in which he will think the evangelists disagree; suppose him instructed, he finds entire
agreement. Can it be right to feign death, and wrong to feign birth? And yet Faustus will
have us acknowledge the birth to be feigned, in order to put an end to the dispute. It will
appear presently in our reply to another objection what we think to be the reason why
Faustus will not admit of any birth, even a feigned one.</p>
<p>4. We deny that there is anything disgraceful in the bodies of saints. Some members,
indeed, are called uncomely, because they have not so pleasing an appearance as those
constantly in view.1015 But attend to what the apostle says, when from the unity and harmony
of the body he enjoins charity on the Church: "Much more those members of the body,
which seem to be feeble, are necessary: and those members of the body, which we think to
be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts
have more abundant comeliness. For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered
the body together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked: that there
should be no schism in the body."1016 The licentious and intemperate use of those members
<note type="footnote">1013 Matt. i. 25; Luke ii. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">1014 Matt. ii. 11; Mark iii. 32; Luke ii. 33; John ii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">1015 In the Retractations, ii. sec 7, Augustin refers in correction of this remark to his Reply to the Second
Answer of Julian, iv. sec. 36, where he makes uncomeliness the effect of sin.</note>
<note type="footnote">1016 1 Cor. xii. 22-25.</note>

<pb n="562"/>
is disgraceful, but not the members themselves; for they are preserved in purity not only by
the unmarried, but also by wedded fathers and mothers of holy life, in whose case the natural
appetite, as serving not lust, but an intelligent purpose in the production of children,
is in no way disgraceful. Still more, in the holy Virgin Mary, who by faith conceived the
body of Christ, there was nothing disgraceful in the members which served not for a common
natural conception, but for a miraculous birth. In order that we might conceive Christ in
sincere hearts, and, as it were, produce Him in confession, it was meet that His body should
come from the substance of His mother without injury to her bodily purity. We cannot
suppose that the mother of Christ suffered loss by His birth, or that the gift of productiveness
displaced the grace of virginity. If these occurrences, which were real and no illusion, are
new and strange, and contrary to the common course of nature, the reason is, that they are
great, and amazing, and divine; and all the more on this account are they true, and firm,
and sure. Angels, says Faustus, appeared and spoke without having been born. As if we
held that Christ could not have appeared or spoken without having been born of a woman!
He could, but He chose not; and what He chose was best. And that He chose to do what
He did is plain, because He acted, not like your god, from necessity, but voluntarily. That
He was born we know, because we put faith not in a heretic, but in Christ’s gospel.</p>

<head>Book XXX.</head>
<p>Faustus repels the insinuation that the prophecy of Paul with reference to those that should
forbid to marry, abstain from meats, etc., applies to the Manichæans more than to the
Catholic ascetics, who are held in the highest esteem in the Church. Augustin justifies
this application of the prophecy, and shows the difference between Manichæan and
Christian asceticism.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You apply to us the words of Paul: "Some shall depart from the faith,
giving heed to lying spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their
consciences seared as with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, abstaining from meats, which
God has created to be received with thanksgiving by believers."1017 I refuse to admit that
the apostle said this, unless you first acknowledge that Moses and the prophets taught doctrines
of devils, and were the interpreters of a lying and malignant spirit; since they enjoin
with great emphasis abstinence from swine’s flesh and other meats, which they call unclean.
This case must first be settled; and you must consider long and carefully how their teaching
is to be viewed: whether they said these things from God, or from the devil. As regards
these matters, either Moses and the prophets must be condemned along with us; or we must
be acquitted along with them. You are unjust in condemning us, as you do now, as followers
of the doctrine of devils, because we require the priestly class to abstain from animal food;
for we limit the prohibition to the priesthood, while you hold that your prophets, and Moses
himself, who forbade all classes of men to eat the flesh of swine, and hares, and conies, besides
all varieties of cuttle-fish, and all fish wanting scales, said this not in a lying spirit, nor in
the doctrine of devils, but from God, and in the Holy Spirit. Even supposing, then, that
Paul said these words, you can convince me only by condemning Moses and the prophets;
and so, though you will not do it for reason or truth, you will contradict Moses for the sake
of your belly.</p>
<p>2. Besides, you have in your Book of Daniel the account of the three youths, which you
will find it difficult to reconcile with the opinion that to abstain from meats is the doctrine
of devils. For we are told that they abstained not only from what the law forbade, but even
from what it allowed;1018 and you are wont to praise them, and count them as martyrs;
though they too followed the doctrine of devils, if this is to be taken as the apostle’s opinion.
And Daniel himself declares that he fasted for three weeks, not eating flesh or drinking wine,
while he prayed for his people.1019 How is it that he boasts of this doctrine of devils, and
glories in the falsehood of a lying spirit?</p>
<note type="footnote">1017 1 Tim. iv. 1-3.</note>
<note type="footnote">1018 Dan. i. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">1019 Dan. x. 2, 3.</note>

<pb n="564"/>
<p>3. Again, what are we to think of you, or of the better class of Christians among you,
some of whom abstain from swine’s flesh, some from the flesh of quadrupeds, and some
from all animal food, while all the Church admires them for it, and regards them with profound
veneration, as only not gods? You obstinately refuse to consider that if the words
quoted from the apostle are true and genuine, these people too are misled by doctrines of
devils. And there is another observance which no one will venture to explain away or to
deny, for it is known to all, and is practised yearly with particular attention in the congregation
of Catholics all over the world—I mean the fast of forty days, in the due observance
of which a man must abstain from all the things which, according to this verse, were created
by God that we might receive them, while at the same time he calls this abstinence a doctrine
of devils. So, my dear friends, shall we say that you too, during this fast, while celebrating
the mysteries of Christ’s passion, live after the manner of devils, and are deluded by a seducing
spirit, and speak lies in hypocrisy, and have your conscience seared with a hot iron? If this
does not apply to you, neither does it apply to us. What is to be thought of this verse, or its
author; or to whom does it apply, since it agrees neither with the traditions of the Old
Testament, nor with the institutions of the New? As regards the New Testament, the proof
is from your own practice; and though the Old requires abstinence only from certain things,
still it requires abstinence. On the other hand, this opinion of yours makes all abstinence
from animal food a doctrine of devils. If this is your belief, once more I say it, you must
condemn Moses, and reject the prophets, and pass the same sentence on yourselves; for, as
they always abstained from certain kinds of food, so you sometimes abstain from all food.</p>
<p>4. But if you think that in making a distinction in food, Moses and the prophets established
a divine ordinance, and not a doctrine of devils; if Daniel in the Holy Spirit observed
a fast of three weeks; if the youths Ananias, Azarias, and Mishael, under divine guidance,
chose to live on cabbage or pulse; if, again, those among you who abstain, do it not at the
instigation of devils; if your abstinence from wine and flesh for forty days is not superstitious,
but by divine command,—consider, I beseech you, if it is not perfect madness to suppose
these words to be Paul’s that abstinence from food and forbidding to marry are doctrines
of devils. Paul cannot have said that to dedicate virgins to Christ is a doctrine of devils. But
you read the words, and inconsiderately, as usual, apply them to us, without seeing that this
stamps your virgins too as led away by the doctrine of devils, and that you are the functionaries
of the devils in your constant endeavors to induce virgins to make this profession, so
that in all your churches the virgins nearly outnumber the married women. Why do you
still adhere to such practises? Why do you ensnare wretched young women, if it is the will
of devils, and not of Christ, that they fulfill? But, first of all, I wish to know if making virgins
is, in all cases, the doctrine of devils, or only the prohibition of marriage. If it is the prohibition,
it does not apply to us, for we too hold it equally foolish to prevent one who wishes,
as it is criminal and impious to force one who has some reluctance. But if you say that to

<pb n="565"/>
encourage the proposal, and not to resist such a desire, is all the doctrine of devils, to say
nothing of the consequence as regards you, the apostle himself will be thus brought into
danger, if he must be considered as having introduced the doctrines of devils into Iconium,
when Thecla, after having been betrothed, was by his discourse inflamed with the desire of
perpetual virginity.1020 And what shall we say of Jesus, the Master Himself, and the source
of all sanctity, who is the unwedded spouse of the virgins who make this profession, and
who, when specifying in the Gospel three kinds of eunuchs, natural, artificial, and voluntary,
gives the palm to those who have "made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven,"1021
meaning the youths of both sexes who have extirpated from their hearts the desire of marriage,
and who in the Church act as eunuchs of the King’s palace? Is this also the doctrine
of devils? Are those words, too, spoken in a seducing spirit? And if Paul and Christ are
proved to be priests of devils, is not their spirit the same that speaks in God? I do not
mention the other apostles of our Lord, Peter, Andrew, Thomas, and the example of celibacy,
the blessed John, who in various ways commended to young men and maidens the excellence
of this profession, leaving to us, and to you too, the form for making virgins. I do not
mention them, because you do not admit them into the canon, and so you will not scruple
impiously to impute to them doctrines of devils. But will you say the same of Christ, or of
the Apostle Paul, who, we know, everywhere expressed the same preference for unmarried
women to the married, and gave an example of it in the case of the saintly Thecla? But if
the doctrine preached by Paul to Thecla, and which the other apostles also preached, was
not the doctrine of devils, how can we believe that Paul left on record his opinion, that the
very exhortation to sanctity is the injunction and the doctrine of devils? To make virgins
simply by exhortation, without forbidding to marry, is not peculiar to you. That is our
principle too; and he must be not only a fool, but a madman, who thinks that a private law
can forbid what the public law allows. As regards marriage, therefore, we too encourage
virgins to remain as they are when they are willing to do so; we do not make them virgins
against their will. For we know the force of will and of natural appetite when opposed by
public law; much more when the law is only private, and every one is at liberty to disobey
it. If, then, it is no crime to make virgins in this manner, we are guiltless as well as you. If
it is wrong to make virgins in any way, you are guilty as well as we. So that what you mean,
or intend, by quoting this verse against us, it is impossible to say.</p>
<p>5. Augustin replied: Listen, and you shall hear what we mean and intend by quoting
this verse against you, since you say that you do not know. It is not that you abstain from
animal food; for, as you observe, our ancient fathers abstained from some kinds of food,
not, however, as condemning them, but with a typical meaning, which you do not understand,
<note type="footnote">1020 See the apocryphal book, Paul and Thecla.</note>
<note type="footnote">1021 Matt. xix. 12.</note>

<pb n="566"/>
and of which I have said already in this work all that appeared necessary. Besides, Christians,
not heretics, but Catholics, in order to subdue the body, that the soul may be more humbled
in prayer, abstain not only from animal food, but also from some vegetable productions,
without, however, believing them to be unclean. A few do this always; and at certain seasons
or days, as in Lent, almost all, more or less, according to the choice or ability of individuals.
You, on the other hand, deny that the creature is good, and call it unclean, saying that animals
are made by the devil of the worst impurities in the substance of evil and so you reject them
with horror, as being the most cruel and loathsome places of confinement of your god. You,
as a concession, allow your followers, as distinct from the priests, to eat animal food; as the
apostle allows, in certain cases, not marriage in the general sense, but the indulgence of
passion in marriage.1022 It is only sin which is thus made allowance for. This is the feeling
you have toward all animal food; you have learned it from your heresy, and you teach it to
your followers. You make allowance for your followers, because, as I said before, they supply
you with necessaries; but you grant them indulgence without saying that it is not sinful.
For yourselves, you shun contact with this evil and impurity; and hence our reason for
quoting this verse against you is found in the words of the apostle which follow those with
which you end the quotation. Perhaps it was for this reason that you left out the words, and
then say that you do not know what we mean or intend by the quotation; for it suited you
better to omit the account of our intention than to express it. For, after speaking of abstaining
from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by believers, the apostle
goes on, "And by them who know the truth; for every creature of God is good, and nothing
to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and
prayer."1023 This you deny; for your idea, and motive, and belief in abstaining from such
food is, that they are not typically, but naturally, evil and impure. In this assuredly you
blaspheme the Creator; and in this is the doctrine of devils. You need not be surprised that,
so long before the event, this prediction regarding you was made by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>6. So, again, if your exhortations to virginity resembled the teaching of the apostle, "He
who giveth in marriage doeth well, and he who giveth not in marriage doeth better;"1024 if
you taught that marriage is good, and virginity better, as the Church teaches which is truly
Christ’s Church, you would not have been described in the Spirit’s prediction as forbidding
to marry. What a man forbids he makes evil; but a good thing may be placed second to a
better thing without being forbidden. Moreover, the only honorable kind of marriage, or
marriage entered into for its proper and legitimate purpose, is precisely that you hate most.
So, though you may not forbid sexual intercourse, you forbid marriage; for the peculiarity
<note type="footnote">1022 1 Cor. vii. 5, 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">1023 1 Tim. iv. 3-5.</note>
<note type="footnote">1024 1 Cor. vii. 38.</note>

<pb n="567"/>
of marriage is, that it is not merely for the gratification of passion, but, as is written in the
contract, for the procreation of children. And, though you allow many of your followers
to retain their connection with you in spite of their refusal, or their inability, to obey you,
you cannot deny that you make the prohibition. The prohibition is part of your false doctrine,
while the toleration is only for the interests of the society. And here we see the reason, which
I have delayed till now to mention, for your making not the birth but only the death of Christ
feigned and illusory. Death being the separation of the soul, that is, of the nature of your
god, from the body which belongs to his enemies, for it is the work of the devil, you uphold
and approve of it; and thus, according to your creed, it was meet that Christ, though He did
not die, should commend death by appearing to die. In birth, again, you believe your god
to be bound instead of released; and so you will not allow that Christ was born even in this
illusory fashion. You would have thought better of Mary had she ceased to be a virgin
without being a mother, than as being a mother without ceasing to be a virgin. You see,
then, that there is a great difference between exhorting to virginity as the better of two good
things, and forbidding to marry by denouncing the true purpose of marriage; between abstaining
from food as a symbolic observance, or for the mortification of the body, and abstaining
from food which God has created for the reason that God did not create it. In one
case, we have the doctrine of the prophets and apostles; in the other, the doctrine of lying
devils.</p>

<p>The scripture passage: "To the pure all things are pure, but to the impure and defiled is
nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled," is discussed from both the
Manichæan and the Catholic points of view, Faustus objecting to its application to his
party and Augustin insisting on its application.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: "To the pure all things are pure. But to the impure and defiled is
nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled." As regards this verse, too,
it is very doubtful whether, for your own sake, you should believe it to have been written
by Paul. For it would follow that Moses and the prophets were not only influenced by devils
in making so much in their laws of the distinctions in food, but also that they themselves
were impure and defiled in their mind and conscience, so that the following words also
might properly be applied to them: "They profess to know God, but in works deny Him."1025
This is applicable to no one more than to Moses and the prophets, who are known to have
lived very differently from what was becoming in men knowing God. Up to this time I have
thought only of adulteries and frauds and murders as defiling the conscience of Moses and
the prophets; but now, from what this verse says, it is plain that they were also defiled, because
they looked upon something as defiled. How, then, can you persist in thinking that the
vision of the divine majesty can have been bestowed on such men, when it is written that
only the pure in heart can see God? Even supposing that they had been pure from unlawful
crimes, this superstitious abstinence from certain kinds of food, if it defiles the mind, is
enough to debar them from the sight of deity. Gone for ever, too, is the boast of Daniel,
and of the three youths, who, till now that we are told that nothing is unclean, have been
regarded among the Jews as persons of great purity and excellence of character, because, in
observance of hereditary customs, they carefully avoided defiling themselves with Gentile
food, especially that of sacrifices.1026 Now it appears that they were defiled in mind and
conscience most of all when they were closing their mouth against blood and idol-feasts.</p>
<p>2. But perhaps their ignorance may excuse them; for, as this Christian doctrine of all
things being pure to the pure had not then appeared, they may have thought some things
impure. But there can be no excuse for you in the face of Paul’s announcement, that there
is nothing which is not pure, and that abstinence from certain food is the doctrine of devils,
and that those who think anything defiled are polluted in their mind, if you not only abstain,
as we have said, but make a merit of it, and believe that you become more acceptable to
Christ in proportion as you are more abstemious, or, according to this new doctrine, as your
minds are defiled and your conscience polluted. It should also be observed that, while there
<note type="footnote">1025 Tit. i. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">1026 Dan. i. 12.</note>

<pb n="569"/>
are three religions in the world which, though in a very different manner, appoint chastity
and abstinence as the means of purification of the mind, the religions, namely, of the Jews,
the Gentiles, and the Christians, the opinion that everything is pure cannot have come from
any one of the three. It is certainly not from Judaism, nor from Paganism, which also makes
a distinction of food; the only difference being, that the Hebrew classification of animals
does not harmonize with the Pagan. Then as to the Christian faith, if you think it peculiar
to Christianity to consider nothing defiled, you must first of all confess that there are no
Christians among you. For things offered to idols, and what dies of itself, to mention
nothing else, are regarded by you all as great defilement. If, again, this is a Christian practice,
on your part, the doctrine which is opposed to all abstinence from impurities cannot be
traced to Christianity either. How, then, could Paul have said what is not in keeping with
any religion? In fact, when the apostle from a Jew became a Christian, it was a change of
customs more than of religion. As for the writer of this verse, there seems to be no religion
which favors his opinion.</p>
<p>3. Be sure, then, whenever you discover anything else in Scripture to assail our faith
with, to see, in the first place, that it is not against you, before you commence your attack
on us. For instance, there is the passage you continually quote about Peter, that he once
saw a vessel let down from heaven in which were all kinds of animals and serpents, and that,
when he was surprised and astonished, a voice was heard, saying to him, Peter, kill and eat
whatsoever thou seest in the vessel, and that he replied, Lord I will not touch what is common
or unclean. On this the voice spoke again, What I have cleansed, call not unclean.1027 This,
indeed, seems to have an allegorical meaning, and not to refer to the absence of distinction
in food. But as you choose to give it this meaning, you are bound to feed upon all wild animals,
and scorpions, and snakes, and reptiles in general, in compliance with this vision of
Peter’s. In this way, you will show that you are really obedient to the voice which Peter is
said to have heard. But you must never forget that you at the same time condemn Moses
and the prophets, who considered many things polluted which, according to this utterance,
God has sanctified.</p>
<p>4. Augustin replied: When the apostle says, "To the pure all things are pure," he refers
to the natures which God had created,—as it is written by Moses in Genesis, "And God
made all things; and behold they were very good,"1028—not to the typical meanings, according
to which God, by the same Moses, distinguished the clean from the unclean. Of this we
have already spoken at length more than once, and need not dwell on it here. It is clear that
the apostle called those impure who, after the revelation of the New Testament, still advocated
the observance of the shadows of things to come, as if without them the Gentiles could not
<note type="footnote">1027 Acts x. 11-15.</note>
<note type="footnote">1028 Gen. i. 31.</note>

<pb n="570"/>
obtain the salvation which is in Christ, because in this they were carnally minded; and he
called them unbelieving, because they did not distinguish between the time of the law and
the time of grace. To them, he says, nothing is pure, because they made an erroneous and
sinful use both of what they received and of what they rejected; which is true of all unbelievers,
but especially of you Manichæans, for to you nothing whatever is pure. For, although you
take great care to keep the food which you use separate from the contamination of flesh,
still it is not pure to you, for the only creator of it you allow is the devil. And you hold, that,
by eating it, you release your god, who suffers confinement and pollution in it. One would
think you might consider yourselves pure, since your stomach is the proper place for purifying
your god. But even your own bodies, in your opinion, are of the nature and handiwork
of the race of darkness; while your souls are still affected by the pollution of your bodies.
What, then, is pure to you? Not the things you eat; not the receptacle of your food; not
yourselves, by whom it is purified. Thus you see against whom the words of the apostle are
directed; he expresses himself so as to include all who are impure and unbelieving, but first
and chiefly to condemn you. To the pure, therefore, all things are pure, in the nature in
which they were created; but to the ancient Jewish people all things were not pure in their
typical significance; and, as regards bodily health, or the customs of society, all things are
not suitable to us. But when things are in their proper places, and the order of nature is
preserved, to the pure all things are pure; but to the impure and unbelieving, among whom
you stand first, nothing is pure. You might make a wholesome application to yourselves of
the following words of the apostle, if you desired a cure for your seared consciences. The
words are: "Their very mind and conscience are defiled."</p>

<p>Faustus fails to understand why he should be required either to accept or reject the New
Testament as a whole, while the Catholics accept or reject the various parts of the Old
Testament at pleasure. Augustin denies that the Catholics treat the Old Testament arbitrarily,
and explains their attitude towards it.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You say, that if we believe the Gospel, we must believe everything that
is written in it. Why, then, since you believe the Old Testament, do you not believe all that
is found in any part of it? Instead of that, you cull out only the prophecies telling of a future
King of the Jews, for you suppose this to be Jesus, along with a few precepts of common
morality, such as, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery; and all the rest you
pass over, thinking of the other things as Paul thought of the things which he held to be
dung.1029 Why, then, should it seem strange or singular in me that I select from the New
Testament whatever is purest, and helpful for my salvation, while I set aside the interpolations
of your predecessors, which impair its dignity and grace?</p>
<p>2. If there are parts of the Testament of the Father which we are not bound to observe
(for you attribute the Jewish law to the Father, and it is well known that many things in it
shock you, and make you ashamed, so that in heart you no longer regard it as free from
corruption, though, as you believe, the Father Himself partly wrote it for you with His own
finger while part was written by Moses, who was faithful and trustworthy), the Testament
of the Son must be equally liable to corruption, and may equally well contain objectionable
things; especially as it is allowed not to have been written by the Son Himself, nor by His
apostles, but long after, by some unknown men, who, lest they should be suspected of writing
of things they knew nothing of, gave to their books the names of the apostles, or of those
who were thought to have followed the apostles, declaring the contents to be according to
these originals. In this, I think, they do grievous wrong to the disciples of Christ, by quoting
their authority for the discordant and contradictory statements in these writings, saying
that it was according to them that they wrote the Gospels, which are so full of errors and
discrepancies, both in facts and in opinions, that they can be harmonized neither with
themselves nor with one another. This is nothing else than to slander good men, and to
bring the charge of dissension on the brotherhood of the disciples. In reading the Gospels,
the clear intention of our heart perceives the errors, and, to avoid all injustice, we accept
whatever is useful, in the way of building up our faith, and promoting the glory of the Lord
Christ, and of the Almighty God, His Father, while we reject the rest as unbecoming the
majesty of God and Christ, and inconsistent with our belief.</p>
<note type="footnote">1029 Phil. iii. 8.</note>

<pb n="572"/>
<p>3. To return to what I said of your not accepting everything in the Old Testament. You
do not admit carnal circumcision, though that is what is written;1030 nor resting from all
occupation on the Sabbath, though that is enjoined;1031 and instead of propitiating God, as
Moses recommends, by offerings and sacrifices, you cast these things aside as utterly out of
keeping with Christian worship, and as having nothing at all to recommend them. In some
cases, however, you make a division, and while you accept one part, you reject the other.
Thus, in the Passover, which is also the annual feast of the Old Testament, while it is written
that in this observance you must slay a lamb to be eaten in the evening, and that you must
abstain from leaven for seven days, and be content with unleavened bread and bitter
herbs,1032 you accept the feast, but pay no attention to the rules for its observance. It is the
same with the feast of Pentecost, or seven weeks, and the accompaniment of a certain kind
and number of sacrifices which Moses enjoins:1033 you observe the feast, but you condemn
the propitiatory rites, which are part of it, because they are not in harmony with Christianity.
As regards the command to abstain from Gentile food, you are zealous believers in the uncleanness
of things offered to idols, and of what has died of itself; but you are not so ready
to believe the prohibition of swine’s flesh, and hares, and conies, and mullets, and cuttlefish,
and all the fish that you have a relish for, although Moses pronounces them all unclean.</p>
<p>4. I do not suppose that you will consent, or even listen, to such things as that a fatherin-
law should lie with his daughter-in-law, as Judah did; or a father with his daughters, like
Lot; or prophets with harlots, like Hosea; or that a husband should sell his wife for a night
to her lover, like Abraham; or that a man should marry two sisters, like Jacob; or that the
rulers of the people and the men you consider as most inspired should keep their mistresses
by hundreds and thousands; or, according to the provision made in Deuteronomy about
wives, that the wife of one brother, if he dies without children, should marry the surviving
brother, and that he should raise up seed from her instead of his brother; and that if the
man refuses to do this, the fair plaintiff should bring her case before the elders, that the
brother may be called and admonished to perform this religious duty; and that, if he persists
in his refusal, he must not go unpunished, but the woman must loose his shoe from his right
foot, and strike him in the face, and send him away, spat upon and accursed, to perpetuate
the reproach in his family.1034 These, and such as these, are the examples and precepts of
the Old Testament. If they are good, why do you not practise them? If they are bad, why
do you not condemn the Old Testament, in which they are found? But if you think that

<note type="footnote">1034 Deut. xxv. 5-10.</note>

<pb n="573"/>
these are spurious interpolations, that is precisely what we think of the New Testament.
You have no right to claim from us an acknowledgment for the New Testament which you
yourselves do not make for the Old.</p>
<p>5. Since you hold to the divine authorship of the Old as well as of the New Testament,
it would surely be more consistent and more becoming, as you do not obey its precepts, to
confess that it has been corrupted by improper additions, than to treat it so contemptuously,
if it is genuine and uncorrupted. Accordingly, my explanation of your neglect of the requirements
of the Old Testament has always been, and still is, that you are either wise enough to
reject them as spurious, or that you have the boldness and irreverence to disregard them if
they are true. At any rate, when you would oblige me to believe everything contained in
the documents of the New Testament because I receive the Testament itself, you should
consider that, though you profess to receive the Old Testament, you in your heart disbelieve
many things in it. Thus, you do not admit as true or authoritative the declaration of the
Old Testament, that every one that hangeth on a tree is accursed,1035 for this would apply
to Jesus; or that every man is accursed who does not raise up seed in Israel,1036 for that
would include all of both sexes devoted to God; or that whoever is not circumcised in the
flesh of his foreskin will be cut off from among his people,1037 for that would apply to all
Christians; or that whoever breaks the Sabbath must be stoned to death;1038 or that no mercy
should be shown to the man who breaks a single precept of the Old Testament. If you really
believe these things as certainly enjoined by God, you would, in the time of Christ, have
been the first to assail Him, and you would now have no quarrel with the Jews, who, in
persecuting Christ with heart and soul, acted in obedience to their own God.</p>
<p>6. I am aware that instead of boldly pronouncing these passages spurious, you make
out that these things were required of the Jews till the coming of Jesus; and that now that
He is come, according, as you say, to the predictions of this Old Testament, He Himself
teaches what we should receive, and what we should set aside as obsolete. Whether the
prophets predicted the coming of Jesus we shall see presently. Meanwhile, I need say no
more than that if Jesus, after being predicted in the Old Testament, now subjects it to this
sweeping criticism, and teaches us to receive a few things and to throw over many things,
in the same way the Paraclete who is promised in the New Testament teaches us what part
of it to receive, and what to reject; as Jesus Himself says in the Gospel, when promising the
Paraclete, "He shall guide you into all truth, and shall teach you all things, and bring all
things to your remembrance."1039 So then, with the help of the Paraclete, we may take the
<note type="footnote">1035 Deut. xxi. 23.</note>

<note type="footnote">1037 Gen. xvii. 14.</note>

<note type="footnote">1039 John xvi. 13, xiv. 26.</note>

<pb n="574"/>
same liberties with the New Testament as Jesus enables you to take with the Old, unless you
suppose that the Testament of the Son is of greater value than that of the Father, if it is really
the Father’s; so that while many parts of the one are to be condemned, the other must be
exempted from all disapproval; and that, too, when we know, as I said before, that it was
not written by Christ or by His apostles.</p>
<p>7. Hence, as you receive nothing in the Old Testament except the prophecies and the
common precepts of practical morality, which we quoted above, while you set aside circumcision,
and sacrifices, and the Sabbath and its observance, and the feast of unleavened bread,
why should not we receive nothing in the New Testament but what we find said in honor
and praise of the majesty of the Son, either by Himself or by His apostles, with the proviso,
in the case of the apostles, that it was said by them after reaching perfection, and when no
longer in unbelief; while we take no notice of the rest, which, if said at the time, was the utterance
of ignorance or inexperience, or, if not, was added by crafty opponents with a malicious
intention, or was stated by the writers without due consideration, and so handed down
as authentic? Take as examples, the shameful birth of Jesus from a woman, His being circumcised
like the Jews, His offering sacrifice like the Gentiles, His being baptized in a humiliating
manner, His being led about by the devil in the wilderness, and His being tempted
by him in the most distressing way. With these exceptions, besides whatever has been inserted
under the pretence of being a quotation from the Old Testament, we believe the whole,
especially the mystic nailing to the cross, emblematic of the wounds of the soul in its passion;
as also the sound moral precepts of Jesus, and His parables, and the whole of His immortal
discourse, which sets forth especially the distinction of the two natures, and therefore must
undoubtedly be His. There is, then, no reason for your thinking it obligatory in me to believe
all the contents of the Gospels; for you, as has been proved, take so dainty a sip from the
Old Testament, that you hardly, so to speak, wet your lips with it.</p>
<p>8. Augustin replied: We give to the whole Old Testament Scriptures their due praise
as true and divine; you impugn the Scriptures of the New Testament as having been tampered
with and corrupted. Those things in the Old Testament which we do not observe we hold
to have been suitable appointments for the time and the people of that dispensation, besides
being symbolical to us of truths in which they have still a spiritual use, though the outward
observance is abolished; and this opinion is proved to be the doctrine of the apostolic writings.
You, on the other hand, find fault with everything in the New Testament which you
do not receive, and assert that these passages were not spoken or written by Christ or His
apostles. In these respects there is a manifest difference between us. When, therefore, you
are asked why you do not receive all the contents of the New Testament, but, while you approve
of some things, reject a great many in the very same books as false and spurious interpolations,
you must not pretend to imitate us in the distinction which we make, reverently
and in faith, but must give account of your own presumption.</p>

<pb n="575"/>
<p>9. If we are asked why we do not worship God as the Hebrew fathers of the Old Testament
worshipped Him, we reply that God has taught us differently by the New Testament
fathers, and yet in no opposition to the Old Testament, but as that Testament itself predicted.
For it is thus foretold by the prophet: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will
make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according
to the covenant which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them
out of the land of Egypt."1040 Thus it was foretold that that covenant would not continue,
but that there would be a new one. And to the objection that we do not belong to the house
of Israel or to the house of Judah, we answer according to the teaching of the apostle, who
calls Christ the seed of Abraham, and says to us, as belonging to Christ’s body, "Therefore
ye are Abraham’s seed."1041 Again, if we are asked why we regard that Testament as authoritative
when we do not observe its ordinances, we find the answer to this also in the
apostolic writings; for the apostle says, "Let no man judge you in meat or drink, or in respect
of a holiday, or a new moon, or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come."1042
Here we learn both that we ought to read of these observances, and acknowledge them to
be of divine institution, in order to preserve the memory of the prophecy, for they were
shadows of things to come; and also that we need pay no regard to those who would judge
us for not continuing the outward observance; as the apostle says elsewhere to the same
purpose, "These things happened to them for an example; and they are written for our admonition,
on whom the end of the ages are come."1043 So, when we read anything in the
books of the Old Testament which we are not required to observe in the New Testament,
or which is even forbidden, instead of finding fault with it, we should ask what it means; for
the very discontinuance of the observance proves it to be, not condemned, but fulfilled. On
this head we have already spoken repeatedly.</p>
<p>10. To take, for example, this requirement on which Faustus ignorantly grounds his
charge against the Old Testament, that a man should take his brother’s wife to raise up seed
for his brother, to be called by his name; what does this prefigure, but that every preacher
of the gospel should so labor in the Church as to raise up seed to his deceased brother, that
is, Christ, who died for us, and that this seed should bear His name? Moreover, the apostle
fulfills this requirement not now in the typical observance, but in the spiritual reality, when
he reproves those of whom he says that he had begotten them in Christ Jesus by the gospel,
1044 and points out to them their error in wishing to be of Paul. "Was Paul," he says,
<note type="footnote">1040 Jer. xxxi. 31, 32.</note>
<note type="footnote">1041 Gal. iii. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">1042 Col. ii. 16, 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">1043 1 Cor. x. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">1044 1 Cor. iv. 15.</note>

<pb n="576"/>
"crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"1045 As if he should say, I
have begotten you for my deceased brother; your name is Christian, not Paulian. Then,
too, whoever refuses the ministry of the gospel when chosen by the Church, justly deserves
the contempt of the Church. So we see that the spitting in the face is accompanied with a
sign of reproach in loosing a shoe from one foot, to exclude the man from the company of
those to whom the apostle says, "Let your feet be shod with the preparation of the gospel of
peace;"1046 and of whom the prophet thus speaks, "How beautiful are the feet of them who
publish peace, who bring good tidings of good!"1047 The man who holds the faith of the
gospel so as both to profit himself and to be ready when called to serve the Church, is
properly represented as shod on both feet. But the man who thinks it enough to secure his
own safety by believing, and shirks the duty of benefiting others, has the reproach of being
unshod, not in type, but in reality.</p>
<p>11. Faustus needlessly objects to our observance of the passover, taunting us with differing
from the Jewish observance: for in the gospel we have the true Lamb, not in shadow,
but in substance; and instead of prefiguring the death, we commemorate it daily, and especially
in the yearly festival. Thus also the day of our paschal feast does not correspond with
the Jewish observance, for we take in the Lord’s day, on which Christ rose. And as to the
feast of unleavened bread, all Christians sound in the faith keep it, not in the leaven of the
old life, that is, of wickedness, but in the truth and sincerity of the faith;1048 not for seven
days, but always, as was typified by the number seven, for days are always counted by sevens.
And if this observance is somewhat difficult in this world since the way which leads to life
is strait and narrow,1049 the future reward is sure; and this difficulty is typified in the bitter
herbs, which are a little distasteful.</p>
<p>12. The Pentecost, too, we observe, that is, the fiftieth day from the passion and resurrection
of the Lord, for on that day He sent to us the Holy Paraclete whom He had promised;
as was prefigured in the Jewish passover, for on the fiftieth day after the slaying of the lamb,
Moses on the mount received the law written with the finger of God.1050 If you read the
Gospel, you will see that the Spirit is there called the finger of God.1051 Remarkable events
which happened on certain days are annually commemorated in the Church, that the recurrence
of this festival may preserve the recollection of things so important and salutary. If

<pb n="577"/>
you ask, then, why we keep the passover, it is because Christ was then sacrificed for us. If
you ask why we do not retain the Jewish ceremonies, it is because they prefigured future
realities which we commemorate as past; and the difference between the future and the past
is seen in the different words we use for them. Of this we have already said enough.</p>
<p>13. Again, if you ask why, of all the kinds of food prohibited in the former typical dispensation,
we abstain only from food offered to idols and from what dies of itself, you shall
hear, if for once you will prefer the truth to idle calumnies. The reason why it is not expedient
for a Christian to eat food offered to idols is given by the apostle: "I would not," he says,
"that ye should have fellowship with demons." Not that he finds fault with sacrifice itself,
as offered by the fathers to typify the blood of the sacrifice with which Christ has redeemed
us. For he first says, "The things which the Gentiles offer, they offer to demons, and not to
God;" and then adds these words: "I would not that ye should have fellowship with
demons."1052 If the uncleanness were in the nature of sacrificial flesh, it would necessarily
pollute even when eaten in ignorance. But the reason for not partaking knowingly is not
in the nature of the food, but, for conscience sake, not to seem to have fellowship with
demons. As regards what dies of itself, I suppose the reason why such food was prohibited
was that the flesh of animals which have died of themselves is diseased, and is not likely to
be wholesome, which is the chief thing in food. The observance of pouring out the blood
which was enjoined in ancient times upon Noah himself after the deluge,1053 the meaning
of which we have already explained, is thought by many to be what is meant in the Acts of
the Apostles, where we read that the Gentiles were required to abstain from fornication,
and from things sacrificed, and from blood,1054 that is, from flesh of which the blood has
not been poured out. Others give a different meaning to the words, and think that to abstain
from blood means not to be polluted with the crime of murder. It would take too long to
settle this question, and it is not necessary. For, allowing that the apostles did on that occasion
require Christians to abstain from the blood of animals, and not to eat of things strangled,
they seem to me to have consulted the time in choosing an easy observance that could not
be burdensome to any one, and which the Gentiles might have in common with the Israelities,
for the sake of the Corner-stone, who makes both one in Himself;1055 while at the
same time they would be reminded how the Church of all nations was prefigured by the ark
of Noah, when God gave this command,—a type which began to be fulfilled in the time of
the apostles by the accession of the Gentiles to the faith. But since the close of that period
during which the two walls of the circumcision and the uncircumcision, although united
<note type="footnote">1052 1 Cor. x. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">1053 Gen. ix. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">1054 Acts xv. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">1055 Eph. ii. 11-22.</note>

<pb n="578"/>
in the Corner-stone, still retained some distinctive peculiarities, and now that the Church
has become so entirely Gentile that none who are outwardly Israelites are to be found in it,
no Christian feels bound to abstain from thrushes or small birds because their blood has
not been poured out, or from hares because they are killed by a stroke on the neck without
shedding their blood. Any who still are afraid to touch these things are laughed at by the
rest: so general is the conviction of the truth, that "not what entereth into the mouth defileth
you, but what cometh out of it;" 1056 that evil lies in the commission of sin, and not in the
nature of any food in ordinary use.</p>
<p>14. As regards the deeds of the ancients, both those which seem sinful to foolish and
ignorant people, when they are not so, and those which really are sinful, we have already
explained why they have been written, and how this rather adds to than impairs the dignity
of Scripture. So, too, about the curse on him who hangeth on a tree, and on him who raises
not up seed in Israel, our reply has already been given in the proper place, when meeting
Faustus’ objections.1057 And in reply to all objections whatsoever, whether we have already
answered them separately, or whether they are contained in the remarks of Faustus which
we are now considering, we appeal to our established principles, on which we maintain the
authority of sacred Scripture. The principle is this, that all things written in the books of
the Old Testament are to be received with approval and admiration, as most true and most
profitable to eternal life; and that those precepts which are no longer observed outwardly
are to be understood as having been most suitable in those times, and are to be viewed as
having been shadows of things to come, of which we may now perceive the fulfillments.
Accordingly, whoever in those times neglected the observance of these symbolical precepts
was righteously condemned to suffer the punishment required by the divine statute, as any
one would be now if he were impiously to profane the sacraments of the New Testament,
which differ from the old observances only as this time differs from that. For as praise is
due to the righteous men of old who refused not to die for the Old Testament sacraments,
so it is due to the martyrs of the New Testament. And as a sick man should not find fault
with the medical treatment, because one thing is prescribed to-day and another to-morrow,
and what was at first required is afterwards forbidden, since the method of cure depends
on this; so the human race, sick and sore as it is from Adam to the end of the world, as long
as the corrupted body weighs down the mind,1058 should not find fault with the divine
prescriptions, if sometimes the same observances are enjoined, and sometimes an old observance
is exchanged for one of a different kind; especially as there was a promise of a
change in the appointments.</p>
<note type="footnote">1056 Matt. xv. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">1057 Book XXII.</note>
<note type="footnote">1058 Wisd. ix. 15.</note>

<pb n="579"/>
<p>15. Hence there is no force in the analogy which Faustus institutes between Christ’s
pointing out to us what to believe and what to reject in the Old Testament, in which He
Himself is predicted, and the Paraclete’s doing the same to you as regards the New Testament,
where there is a similar prediction of Him. There might have been some plausibility in this,
had there been anything in the Old Testament which we denounced as a mistake, or as not
of divine authority, or as untrue. We do nothing of the kind; we receive everything, both
what we observe as rules of conduct, and what we no longer observe, but still recognize as
having been prophetical observances, once enjoined and now fulfilled. And besides, the
promise of the Paraclete is found in those books, all the contents of which you do not accept;
and His mission is recorded in the book which you shrink from even naming. For, as is
stated above, and has been said repeatedly, there is a distinct narrative in the Acts of the
Apostles of the mission of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, and the effect produced showed
who it was. For all who first received Him spoke with tongues;1059 and in this sign there
was a promise that in all tongues, or in all nations, the Church of after times would faithfully
proclaim the doctrine of the Spirit as well as of the Father and of the Son.</p>
<p>16. Why, then, do you not accept everything in the New Testament? Is it because the
books have not the authority of Christ’s apostles, or because the apostles taught what was
wrong? You reply that the books have not the authority of the apostles. That the apostles
were wrong in their teaching is what Pagans say. But what can you say to prove that the
publication of these books cannot be traced to the apostles? You reply that in many things
they contradict themselves and one another. Nothing could be more untrue; the fact is, you
do not understand. In every case where Faustus has brought forward what you think a
discrepancy, we have shown that there was none; and we will do the same in every other
case. It is intolerable that the reader or learner should dare to lay the blame on Scriptures
of such high authority, instead of confessing his own stupidity. Did the Paraclete teach you
that these writings are not of the apostles’ authorship, but written by others under their
names? But where is the proof that it was the Paraclete from whom you learned this? If
you say that the Paraclete was promised and sent by Christ, we reply that your Paraclete
was neither promised nor sent by Christ; and we also show you when He sent the Paraclete
whom He promised. What proof have you that Christ sent your Paraclete? Where do you
get the evidence in support of your informant, or rather misinformant? You reply that you
find the proof in the Gospel. In what Gospel? You do not accept all the Gospel, and you
say that it has been tampered with. Will you first accuse your witness of corruption, and
then call for his evidence? To believe him when you wish it, and then disbelieve him when
you wish it, is to believe nobody but yourself. If we were prepared to believe you, there
<note type="footnote">1059 Acts ii.</note>

<pb n="580"/>
would be no need of a witness at all. Moreover, in the promise of the Holy Spirit as the
Paraclete, it is said, "He shall lead you into all truth;"1060 but how can you be led into all
truth by one who teaches you that Christ was a deceiver? And again, if you were to prove
that all that is said in the Gospel of the promise of the Paraclete could apply to no one but
Manichæus, as the predictions of the prophets are applicable to Christ; and if you quoted
passages from those manuscripts which you say are genuine, we might say that on this very
point, as proving Manichæus to be the only person intended, the passages have been altered
in the interest of your sect. Your only answer to this would be, that you could not possibly
alter documents already in the possession of all Christians; for at the very outset of such an
attempt, it would be met by an appeal to older copies. But if this proves that the books could
not be corrupted by you, it also proves that they could not be corrupted by any one. The
first person who ventured to do such a thing would be convicted by a comparison of older
manuscripts; especially as the Scripture is to be found not in one language only, but in many.
As it is, false readings are sometimes corrected by comparing older copies or the original
language. Hence you must either acknowledge these documents as genuine, and then your
heresy cannot stand a moment; or if they are spurious, you cannot use their authority in
support of your doctrine of the Paraclete, and so you refute yourselves.</p>
<p>17. Further, what is said in the promise of the Paraclete shows that it cannot possibly
refer to Manichæus, who came so many years after. For it is distinctly said by John, that
the Holy Spirit was to come immediately after the resurrection and ascension of the Lord:
"For the Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified."1061 Now, if the
reason why the Spirit was not given was, that Jesus was not glorified, He would necessarily
be given immediately on the glorification of Jesus. In the same way, the Cataphrygians1062
said that they had received the promised Paraclete; and so they fell away from the Catholic
faith, forbidding what Paul allowed, and condemning second marriages, which he made
lawful. They turned to their own use the words spoken of the Spirit, "He shall lead you into
all truth," as if, forsooth, Paul and the other apostles had not taught all the truth, but had
left room for the Paraclete of the Cataphrygians. The same meaning they forced from the
words of Paul: "We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect
is come, then that which is in part shall be done away;"1063 making out that the apostle knew
and prophesied in part, when he said, "Let him do what he will; if he marries, he sinneth
<note type="footnote">1060 John xvi. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">1061 John vii. 39.</note>
<note type="footnote">1062 [Another name for the Montanists, who arose in Phrygia shortly after the middle of the second century.—
A.H.N.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1063 1 Cor. xiii. 9, 10.</note>

<pb n="581"/>
not,"1064 and that this is done away by the perfection of the Phrygian Paraclete.1065 And if
they are told that they are condemned by the authority of the Church, which is the subject
of such ancient promises, and is spread all over the world, they reply that this is in exact
fulfillment of what is said of the Paraclete, that the world cannot receive Him.1066 And are
not those passages, "He shall lead you into all truth," and, "When that which is perfect is
come, that which is in part shall be done away," and, "The world cannot receive Him," precisely
those in which you find a prediction of Manichæus? And so every heresy arising under
the name of the Paraclete will have the boldness to make an equally plausible application
to itself of such texts. For there is no heresy but will call itself the truth; and the prouder it
is, the more likely it will be to call itself perfect truth: and so it will profess to lead into all
truth; and since that which is perfect has come by it, it will try to do away with the doctrine
of the apostles, to which its own errors are opposed. And as the Church holds by the earnest
admonition of the apostle, that "whoever preaches another gospel to you than that which
ye have received, let him be accursed;"1067 when the heretical preacher begins to be pronounced
accursed by all the world, will he not forthwith exclaim, This is what is written,
"The world cannot receive Him"?</p>
<p>18. Where, then, will you find the proof required to show that it is from the Paraclete
that you have learned that the Gospels were not written by the apostles? On the other hand,
we have proof that the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, came immediately after the glorification
of Jesus. For "He was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified." We have proof
also that He leads into all truth, for the only way to truth is by love, and "the love of God,"
says the apostle, "is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given unto us."1068
We show, too, that in the words, "when that which is perfect is come," Paul spoke of the
perfection in the enjoyment of eternal life. For in the same place he says: "Now we see
through a glass darkly, but then face to face."1069 You cannot reasonably maintain that we
see God face to face here. Therefore that which is perfect has not come to you. It is thus
clear what the apostle thought on this subject. This perfection will not come to the saints
till the accomplishment of what John speaks of: "Now we are the sons of God, and it doth
not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when it shall appear we shall be like Him,
for we shall see Him as He is." 1070 Then we shall be led into all truth by the Holy Spirit, of

<note type="footnote">1070 1 John iii. 2.</note>

<pb n="582"/>
which we have now received the pledge. Again, the words, "The world cannot receive Him,"
plainly point to those who are usually called the world in Scripture—the lovers of the world,
the wicked, or carnal; of whom the apostle says: "The natural man perceiveth not the things
which are of the Spirit of God."1071 Those are said to be of this world who can understand
nothing beyond material things, which are the objects of sense in this world; as is the case
with you, when, in your admiration of the sun and moon, you suppose all divine things to
resemble them. Deceivers, and being deceived, you call the author of this silly theory the
Paraclete. But as you have no proof of his being the Paraclete, you have no reliable ground
for the statement that the Gospel writings, which you receive only in part, are not of
apostolic authorship. Thus your only remaining argument is, that these writings contain
things disparaging to the glory of Christ; such as, that He was born of a virgin, that He was
circumcised, that the customary sacrifice was offered for Him, that He was baptized, that
He was tempted of the devil.</p>
<p>19. With those exceptions, including also the testimonies quoted from the Old Testament,
you profess, to use the words of Faustus, to receive all the rest, especially the mystic
nailing to the cross, emblematic of the wounds of the soul in its passion; as also the sound
moral precepts of Jesus, and the whole of His immortal discourse, which sets forth especially
the distinction of the two natures, and therefore must undoubtedly be His. Your design
clearly is to deprive Scripture of all authority, and to make every man’s mind the judge what
passage of Scripture he is to approve of, and what to disapprove of. This is not to be subject
to Scripture in matters of faith, but to make Scripture subject to you. Instead of making the
high authority of Scripture the reason of approval, every man makes his approval the reason
for thinking a passage correct. If, then, you discard authority, to what, poor feeble soul,
darkened by the mists of carnality, to what, I beseech you, will you betake yourself? Set
aside authority, and let us hear the reason of your beliefs. Is it by a logical process that your
long story about the nature of God concludes necessarily with this startling announcement,
that this nature is subject to injury and corruption? And how do you know that there are
eight continents and ten heavens, and that Atlas bears up the world, and that it hangs from
the great world-holder, and innumerable things of the same kind? Who is your authority?
Manichæus, of course, you will say. But, unhappy being, this is not sight, but faith. If, then,
you submit to receive a load of endless fictions at the bidding of an obscure and irrational
authority, so that you believe all those things because they are written in the books which
your misguided judgment pronounces trustworthy, though there is no evidence of their
truth, why not rather submit to the authority of the Gospel, which is so well founded, so
confirmed, so generally acknowledged and admired, and which has an unbroken series of
testimonies from the apostles down to our own day, that so you may have an intelligent
<note type="footnote">1071 1 Cor. ii. 14.</note>

<pb n="583"/>
belief, and may come to know that all your objections are the fruit of folly and perversity;
and that there is more truth in the opinion that the unchangeable nature of God should take
part of mortality, so as, without injury to itself from this union, to do and to suffer not
feignedly, but really, whatever it behoved the mortal nature to do and to suffer for the salvation
of the human race from which it was taken, than in the belief that the nature of God is
subject to injury and corruption, and that, after suffering pollution and captivity, it cannot
be wholly freed and purified, but is condemned by a supreme divine necessity to eternal
punishment in the mass of darkness?</p>
<p>20. You say, in reply, that you believe in what Manichæus has not proved, because he
has so clearly proved the existence of two natures, good and evil, in this world. But here is
the very source of your unhappy delusion; for as in the Gospels, so in the world, your idea
of what is evil is derived entirely from the effect on your senses of such disagreeable things
as serpents, fire, poison, and so on; and the only good you know of is what has an agreeable
effect on your senses, as pleasant flavors, and sweet smells, and sunlight, and whatever else
recommends itself strongly to your eyes, or your nostrils, or your palate, or any other organ
of sensation. But had you begun with looking on the book of nature as the production of
the Creator of all, and had you believed that your own finite understanding might be at fault
wherever anything seemed to be amiss, instead of venturing to find fault with the works of
God, you would not have been led into these impious follies and blasphemous fancies with
which, in your ignorance of what evil really is, you heap all evils upon God.</p>
<p>21. We can now answer the question, how we know that these books were written by
the apostles. In a word, we know this in the same way that you know that the books whose
authority you are so deluded as to prefer were written by Manichæus. For, suppose some
one should raise a question on this point, and should contend, in arguing with you, that the
books which you attribute to Manichæus are not of his authorship; your only reply would
be, to ridicule the absurdity of thus gratuitously calling in question a matter confirmed by
successive testimonies of such wide extent. As, then, it is certain that these books are the
production of Manichæus, and as it is ridiculous in one born so many years after to start
objections of his own, and so raise a discussion on the point; with equal certainty may we
pronounce it absurd, or rather pitiable, in Manichæus or his followers to bring such objections
against writings originally well authenticated, and carefully handed down from the
times of the apostles to our own day through a constant succession of custodians.</p>
<p>22. We have now only to compare the authority of Manichæus with that of the apostles.
The genuineness of the writings is equally certain in both cases. But no one will compare
Manichæus to the apostles, unless he ceases to be a follower of Christ, who sent the apostles.
Who that did not misunderstand Christ’s words ever found in them the doctrine of two
natures opposed to one another, and having each its own principle? Again, the apostles, as
becomes the disciples of truth, declare the birth and passion of Christ to have been real

<pb n="584"/>
events; while Manichæus, who boasts that he leads into all truth, would lead us to a Christ
whose very passion he declares to have been an illusion. The apostles say that Christ was
circumcised in the flesh which He took of the seed of Abraham; Manichæus says that God,
in his own nature, was cut in pieces by the race of darkness. The apostles say that a sacrifice
was offered for Christ as an infant in our nature, according to the institutions of the time;
Manichæus, that a member, not of humanity, but of the divine substance itself, must be
sacrificed to the whole host of demons by being introduced into the nature of the hostile
race. The apostles say that Christ, to set us an example, was baptized in the Jordan;
Manichæus, that God immersed himself in the pollution of darkness, and that he will never
wholly emerge, but that the part which cannot be purified will be condemned to eternal
punishment. The apostles say that Christ, in our nature, was tempted by the chief of the
demons; Manichæus, that part of God was taken captive by the race of demons. And in the
temptation of Christ He resists the tempter; while in the captivity of God, the part taken
captive cannot be restored to its origin even after victory. To conclude, Manichæus, under
the guise of an improvement, preaches another gospel, which is the doctrine of devils; and
the apostles, after the doctrine of Christ, enjoin that whoever preaches another gospel shall
be accursed.1072</p>

<p>Faustus does not think it would be a great honor to sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
whose moral characters as set forth in the Old Testament he detests. He justifies his subjective
criticism of Scripture. Augustin sums up the argument, claims the victory, and
exhorts the Manichæans to abandon their opposition to the Old Testament notwithstanding
the difficulties that it presents, and to recognize the authority of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>1. Faustus said: You quote from the Gospel the words, "Many shall come from the east
and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
heaven,"1073 and ask why we do not acknowledge the patriarchs. Now, we should be the
last to grudge to any human being that God should have compassion on him, and bring
him out of perdition to salvation. At the same time, we should acknowledge in such a case
the clemency shown in this act of compassion, and not the merit of the person whose life
is undeniably blameworthy. Thus, in the case of the Jewish fathers, Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, who are mentioned by Christ in this verse, supposing it to be genuine, although
they led wicked lives, as we may learn from their descendant Moses, or whoever was the
author of the history called Genesis, which describes their conduct as having been most
shocking and detestable; we are ready to allow that they may, after all, be in the kingdom
of heaven, in the place which they neither believed in, nor hoped for, as is plain enough
from their books. But then it must be kept in mind that, as you yourselves confess, if they
did attain to what is spoken of in this verse, it was something very different from the nether
dungeons of woe to which their own deserts consigned them, and that their deliverance was
the work of our Lord Christ, and the result of His mystic passion. Who would grudge to
the thief on the cross that deliverance was granted to him by the same Lord, and that Christ
said that on that very day he should be with Him in the paradise of His Father? 1074 Who
is so hard-hearted as to disapprove of this act of benevolence? Still, it does not follow that,
because Jesus pardoned a thief, we must approve of the habits and practices of thieves; any
more than of the publicans and harlots, whose faults Jesus pardoned, declaring that they
would go into the kingdom of heaven before those who behaved proudly.1075 For, when
He acquitted the woman accused by the Jews as sinful, and as having been caught in adultery,
He told her to sin no more.1076 If, then, He has done something of the same kind in the
case of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, all the praise is His; for such actions towards souls
are becoming in Him who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and upon the good, and

sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.1077 One thing perplexes me in your doctrine:
why you limit your statements to the fathers of the Jews, and are not of opinion that the
Gentile patriarchs had also a share in this grace of our Redeemer; especially as the Christian
Church consists of their children more than of the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You
will say that the Gentiles worshipped idols, and the Jews the Almighty God, and that therefore
Jesus had regard only to the Jews. It would seem from this that the worship of the Almighty
God is the sure way to hell, and that the Son must come to the aid of the worshipper of the
Father. That is as you please. For my part, I am ready to join you in the belief that the
fathers reached heaven, not by any merit of their own, but by that divine mercy which is
stronger than sin.</p>
<p>2. However, there is a difficulty in deciding as regards this verse too, whether the words
were really spoken to Christ, for there is a discrepancy in the narratives. For while two
evangelists, Matthew and Luke, both alike tell of the centurion whose servant was sick, and
to whom these words of Jesus are supposed to have applied, that He had not seen so great
faith, no, not in Israel, as in this man, though a Gentile and a Pagan, because he said that
he was not worthy that Jesus should come under his roof, but wished Him only to speak the
word, and his servant should be healed; Matthew alone adds that Jesus went on to say,
"Verily I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit
down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of
the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness." By the many who should come are meant
the Pagans, on account of the centurion, in whom, although he was a Gentile, so great faith
was found; and the children of the kingdom are the Jews, in whom there was no faith found.
Luke, again, though he too mentions the occurrence in his Gospel as part of the narrative
of the miracles of Christ, says nothing of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If it is said that he
omitted it because it had been already said by Matthew, why does he tell the story at all of
the centurion and his servant, since that, too, has the advantage of being recorded at length
in Matthew’s ingenious narrative? But the passage is corrupt. For, in describing the centurion’s
application to Jesus, Matthew says that he came himself to ask for a cure; while Luke
says he did not, but sent elders of the Jews, and that they, in case Jesus should despise the
centurion as a Gentile (for they will have Jesus to be a thorough Jew), set about persuading
Him, by saying that he was worthy for whom He should do this, because he loved their nation,
and had built them a synagogue; 1078 here again taking for granted that the Son of God was
concerned in a pagan centurion having thought it proper to build a synagogue for the Jews.
The words in question are, indeed, found in Luke also, perhaps because on reflection he
thought they might be genuine; but they are found in another place, and in a connection
<note type="footnote">1077 Matt. v. 45.</note>
<note type="footnote">1078 Matt. viii. 5-13; Luke vii. 2-10.</note>

<pb n="587"/>
altogether different. The passage is where Jesus says to His disciples, "Strive to enter in at
the strait gate; for many shall come seeking to enter in, and shall not be able. When once
the Master of the house has entered in, and has shut to the door, ye shall begin to stand
without, and to knock, saying Lord, open to us. And He shall answer and say, I know you
not. Then ye shall begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in Thy presence, and Thou hast
taught in our streets and synagogues; but He shall say unto you, I know not whence ye are;
depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,
when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, entering into the
kingdom of God, and you yourselves cast out. And they shall come from the east, and from
the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of
God."1079 The part where it is said that many shall be shut out of the kingdom of God, who
have only borne the name of Christ, without doing His works, is not left out by Matthew;
but he makes no mention here of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. In the same way, Luke
mentions the centurion and his servant, without alluding in that connection to Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob. Since it is uncertain when the words were spoken, we are at liberty to
doubt whether they were spoken at all.</p>
<p>3. It is not without reason that we bring a critical judgment to the study of Scriptures
where there are such discrepancies and contradictions. By thus examining everything, and
comparing one passage with another, we determine which contains Christ’s actual words,
and what may or may not be genuine. For your predecessors have made many interpolations
in the words of our Lord, which thus appear under His name, while they disagree with His
doctrine. Besides, as we have proved again and again, the writings are not the production
of Christ or of His apostles, but a compilation of rumors and beliefs, made, long after their
departure, by some obscure semi-Jews, not in harmony even with one another, and published
by them under the name of the apostles, or of those considered the followers of the apostles,
so as to give the appearance of apostolic authority to all these blunders and falsehoods. But
whatever you make of that, as regards this verse, I repeat that I do not insist on rejecting it.
It is enough for my position, that, as I said before, and as you are obliged to confess, before
the coming of our Lord all the patriarchs and prophets of Israel lay in infernal darkness for
their sins. Even though they may have been restored to light and liberty by Christ, that has
nothing to do with the hateful character of their lives. We hate and eschew not their persons,
but their characters; not as they are now, when they are purified, but as they were, when
impure. So, whatever you think of this verse, it does not affect us: for if it is genuine, it only
illustrates Christ’s goodness and compassion; and if it is spurious, those who wrote it are to
blame. Our cause is as safe as it always is.</p>
<note type="footnote">1079 Luke xiii. 24-29.</note>

<pb n="588"/>
<p>4. Augustin replied: Poor safety, indeed! when you contradict yourself by hating the
patriarchs as impure, at the same time that you grieve for your impure god. You allow that,
since the advent of the Saviour, the patriarchs have had purity restored, and have enjoyed
the rest of the blessed; while your god, even after the Saviour’s advent, still lies in darkness,
is still sunk in the ocean of iniquity, still wallows in the mire of all uncleanness. These men,
therefore, were not only better than your god in their lives, but also happier in their death.
Where was the abode of the just who departed from this life before Christ’s coming in the
flesh, and whether their condition also was improved by the passion of Christ, in whom
they had believed as to come, and to suffer, and to rise again, and had, moreover, foretold
this in suitable language under the guidance of the Spirit of prophecy, is to be discovered
from the Holy Scriptures, if any clear discovery in this matter is possible; we are not called
on to adopt the crude notions of all and sundry, still less the heretical opinions of men who
have gone astray into such egregious error. There is a vain attempt here on the part of
Faustus to introduce by a side-door the idea that we may obtain something after this life
besides the due reward of our conduct in this life. It will be better for you to abandon your
error while you are still alive, and to embrace and hold the truths of the Catholic faith.
Otherwise the expectations of the unrighteous will be sadly disappointed when God begins
to fulfill His threatenings to the unrighteous.</p>
<p>5. I have already given what I considered a sufficient answer to Faustus’ calumnies of
the lives of the patriarchs. That they were punished at their death, or that they were justified
after the Lord’s passion, is not what we learn from His commendation of them, when He
admonished the Jews that, if they were Abraham’s children, they should do the works of
Abraham, and said that Abraham desired to see His day, and was glad when he saw it; 1080
and that it was into his bosom, that is, some deep recess of blissful repose, that the angels
carried the poor sufferer who was despised by the proud rich man.1081 And what are we to
make of the Apostle Paul? Is there any idea of justification after death in his praise of Abraham,
when he says that before he was circumcised he believed God, and that it was counted
to him for righteousness?1082 And so much importance does he attach to this, that the
single ground which he specifies for our becoming Abraham’s children, though not descended
from him in the flesh, is, that we follow the footsteps of his faith.</p>
<p>6. You are so hardened in your errors against the testimonies of Scripture, that nothing
can be made of you; for whenever anything is quoted against you, you have the boldness to
say that it is written not by the apostle, but by some pretender under his name. The doctrine
of demons which you preach is so opposed to Christian doctrine, that you could not continue,

<pb n="589"/>
as professing Christians, to maintain it, unless you denied the truth of the apostolic writings.
How can you thus do injury to your own souls? Where will you find any authority, if not
in the Gospel and apostolic writings? How can we be sure of the authorship of any book,
if we doubt the apostolic origin of those books which are attributed to the apostles by the
Church which the apostles themselves founded, and which occupies so conspicuous a place
in all lands, and if at the same time we acknowledge as the undoubted production of the
apostles what is brought forward by heretics in opposition to the Church, whose authors,
from whom they derive their name, lived long after the apostles? And do we not see in
profane literature that there are well-known authors under whose names many things have
been published after their time which have been rejected, either from inconsistency with
their ascertained writings, or from their not having been known in the lifetime of the authors,
so as to be banded down with the confirmatory statement of the authors themselves, or of
their friends? To give a single example, were not some books published lately under the
name of the distinguished physician Hippocrates, which were not received as authoritative
by physicians? And this decision remained unaltered in spite of some similarity in style and
matter: for, when compared to the genuine writings of Hippocrates, these books were found
to be inferior; besides that they were not recognized as his at the time when his authorship
of his genuine productions was ascertained. Those books, again, from a comparison with
which the productions of questionable origin were rejected, are with certainty attributed to
Hippocrates; and any one who denies their authorship is answered only by ridicule, simply
because there is a succession of testimonies to the books from the time of Hippocrates to
the present day, which makes it unreasonable either now or hereafter to have any doubt on
the subject. How do we know the authorship of the works of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Varro,
and other similar writers, but by the unbroken chain of evidence? So also with the numerous
commentaries on the ecclesiastical books, which have no canonical authority, and yet show
a desire of usefulness and a spirit of inquiry. How is the authorship ascertained in each case,
except by the author’s having brought his work into public notice as much as possible in
his own lifetime, and, by the transmission of the information from one to another in continuous
order, the belief becoming more certain as it becomes more general, up to our own
day; so that, when we are questioned as to the authorship of any book, we have no difficulty
in answering? But why speak of old books? Take the books now before us: should any one,
after some years, deny that this book was written by me, or that Faustus’ was written by
him, where is evidence for the fact to be found but in the information possessed by some at
the present time, and transmitted by them through successive generations even to distant
times? From all this it follows, that no one who has not yielded to the malicious and deceitful
suggestions of lying devils, can be so blinded by passion as to deny the ability of the Church
of the apostles—a community of brethren as numerous as they were faithful—to transmit
their writings unaltered to posterity, as the original seats of the apostles have been occupied

<pb n="590"/>
by a continuous succession of bishops to the present day, especially when we are accustomed
to see this happen in the case of ordinary writings both in the Church and out of it.</p>
<p>7. But Faustus finds contradictions in the Gospels. Say, rather, that Faustus reads the
Gospels in a wrong spirit, that he is too foolish to understand, and too blind to see. If you
were animated with piety instead of being misled by party spirit, you might easily, by examining
these passages, discover a wonderful and most instructive harmony among the
writers. Who, in reading two narratives of the same event, would think of charging one or
both of the authors with error or falsehood, because one omits what the other mentions, or
one tells concisely, but with substantial agreement, what the other relates in detail, so as to
indicate not only what was done, but also how it was done? This is what Faustus does in
his attempt to impeach the truth of the Gospels; as if Luke’s omitting some saying of Christ
recorded in Matthew implied a denial on the part of Luke of Matthew’s statement. There
is no real difficulty in the case; and to make a difficulty shows want of thought, or of the
ability to think. There is, indeed, a point in the narrative of the centurion which is discussed
among believers, and on which objections are raised by unbelievers of no great learning,
who prove their quarrelsomeness, when, after being instructed, they do not give up their
errors. The point is, that Matthew says that the centurion came to Jesus "beseeching Him,
and saying;" while Luke says that he sent to Jesus the elders of the Jews with this same request,
that He would heal his servant who was sick; and that when He came near the house he sent
others, through whom he said that he was not worthy that Jesus should come into his house,
and that he was not worthy to come himself to Jesus. How, then, do we read in Matthew,
"He came to Him, beseeching Him, and saying, My servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
and grievously tormented?"1083 The explanation is, that Matthew’s narrative is correct, but
brief, mentioning the centurion’s coming to Jesus, without saying whether he came himself
or by others, or whether the words about his servant were spoken by himself or through
others. But is it not common to speak of a person as coming near to a thing, although he
may not reach it? And even the word reach, which is the strongest form of expression, is
frequently used in cases where the person spoken of acts through others, as when we say he
took his case to court, he reached the presence of the judge; or, again, he reached the presence
of some man in power, although it may probably have been through his friends, and the
person may not have seen him whose presence he is said to have reached. And from the
word for to reach we give the name of Perventors to those who by ambitious arts gain access,
either personally or through friends, to the, so to speak, inaccessible minds of the great.
Are we, then, in reading to forget the common usage of speech? Or must the sacred Scripture
have a language of its own? The cavils of forward critics are thus met by a reference to the
usual forms of speech.</p>
<note type="footnote">1083 Matt. viii. 5-13; Luke vii. 2-10.</note>

<pb n="591"/>
<p>8. Those who examine this matter not in a disputatious but in a calm believing spirit
are invited to come to Jesus, not outwardly but in heart, not in bodily presence but in the
power of faith, as the centurion did, and then they will better understand Matthew’s narrative.
To such it is said in the Psalm "Come unto Him, and be enlightened; and your faces
shall not be ashamed."1084 Hence we learn that the centurion, whose faith was so highly
spoken of, came to Christ more truly than the people who carried his message. We find an
analogous case in the woman with the issue of blood, who was healed by touching the hem
of Christ’s garment, when Christ said, "Some one hath touched me." The disciples wondered
what Christ meant by saying, "Who hath touched me?" "Some one hath touched me," when
the crowd was thronging Him. In fact, they made this reply: "The crowd throngeth Thee,
and sayest Thou, Who hath touched me?"1085 Now, as the people thronged Christ while
the woman touched Him, so the messengers were sent to Christ, but the centurion really
came to Him. In Matthew we have a not infrequent form of expression, and at the same
time a symbolical import; while in Luke there is a simple narrative of the whole event, such
as to draw our attention to the manner in which Matthew has recorded it. I wish one of
those people who found their silly objections to the Gospels on such trifling difficulties
would himself tell a story twice over, honestly giving a true account of what happened, and
that his words were written down and read over to him. We should then see whether he
would not say more or less at one time than at another; and whether the order would not
be changed, not only of words, but of things; and whether he would not put some opinion
of his own into the mouth of another, because, though he never heard him say it, he knew
it perfectly well to be in his mind; and whether he would not sometimes put in a few words
what he had before related at length. In these and other ways, which might perhaps be reduced
to rule, the narratives of the same thing by two persons, or two narratives by the same
person, might differ in many things without being opposed, might be unlike without being
contradictory. Thus are undone all the bandages with which poor Manichæans stifle
themselves to keep in the spirit of error, and to keep out all that might lead to their salvation.</p>
<p>9. Now that all Faustus’ calumnies have been refuted, those at least on the subjects here
treated of at large and explained fully as the Lord has enabled me, I close with a word of
counsel to you who are implicated in those shocking and damnable errors, that, if you acknowledge
the supreme authority of Scripture, you should recognise that authority which
from the time of Christ Himself, through the ministry of His apostles, and through a regular
succession of bishops in the seats of the apostles, has been preserved to our own day
throughout the whole world, with a reputation known to all. There the Old Testament too
has its difficulties solved, and its predictions fulfilled. If you ask for demonstration, consider

first what you are, how unfit for comprehending the nature of your own soul, not to speak
of God; I mean an intelligent comprehension, such as you profess to desire, or to have once
desired, and not the notions of a credulous fancy. Admitting this incompetency, which
must continue while you remain as you are, you may at least be referred to the natural
conviction of every human mind, unless it is corrupted by error, of the perfect unchangeableness
and incorruptibility of the nature and substance of God. Admit this, or believe it,
and you will no longer be Manichæans, so that in course of time you may become Catholics.</p>

<p>In One Book.</p>
<p>Written after the year 404. It is put in the Retractations immediately after the De Actis
cum Felice Manichæo, which was written about the end of the year 404. It is one of the most
argumentative of the Anti-Manichæan treatises, and so one of the most abstruse and difficult.
The lines of argument here pursued have already been employed in part in the earlier
treatises. The most interesting portions of the contents of the treatise, and the most damaging
to the Manichæans, are the long extracts from Mani’s Thesaurus, and his Fundamental
Epistle.—A.H.N.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="595"/>
<head>Chapter 1.—God the Highest and Unchangeable Good, from Whom are All Other
Good Things, Spiritual and Corporeal.</head>
<p>The highest good, than which there is no higher, is God, and consequently He is unchangeable
good, hence truly eternal and truly immortal. All other good things are only
from Him, not of Him. For what is of Him, is Himself. And consequently if He alone is
unchangeable, all things that He has made, because He has made them out of nothing, are
changeable. For He is so omnipotent, that even out of nothing, that is out of what is absolutely
non-existent, He is able to make good things both great and small, both celestial and
terrestrial, both spiritual and corporeal. But because He is also just, He has not put those
things that He has made out of nothing on an equality with that which He begat out of
Himself. Because, therefore, no good things whether great or small, through whatever
gradations of things, can exist except from God; but since every nature, so far as it is nature,
is good, it follows that no nature can exist save from the most high and true God: because
all things even not in the highest degree good, but related to the highest good, and again,
because all good things, even those of most recent origin, which are far from the highest
good, can have their existence only from the highest good. Therefore every spirit, though
subject to change, and every corporeal entity, is from God, and all this, having been made,
is nature. For every nature is either spirit or body. Unchangeable spirit is God, changeable
spirit, having been made, is nature, but is better than body; but body is not spirit, unless
when the wind, because it is invisible to us and yet its power is felt as something not inconsiderable,
is in a certain sense called spirit.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="596"/>
<head>Chapter 2.—How This May Suffice for Correcting the Manichæans.</head>
<p>But for the sake of those who, not being able to understand that all nature, that is, every
spirit and every body, is naturally good, are moved by the iniquity of spirit and the mortality
of body, and on this account endeavor to bring in another nature of wicked spirit and
mortal body, which God did not make, we determine thus to bring to their understanding
what we say can be brought. For they acknowledge that no good thing can exist save from
the highest and true God, which also is true and suffices for correcting them, if they are
willing to give heed.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="597"/>
<head>Chapter 3.—Measure, Form, and Order, Generic Goods in Things Made by God.</head>
<p>For we Catholic Christians worship God, from whom are all good things whether great
or small; from whom is all measure great or small; from whom is all form great or small;
from whom is all order great or small. For all things in proportion as they are better measured,
formed, and ordered, are assuredly good in a higher degree; but in proportion as they
are measured, formed, and ordered in an inferior degree, are they the less good. These three
things, therefore, measure, form, and order,—not to speak of innumerable other things that
are shown to pertain to these three,—these three things, therefore, measure, form, order,
are as it were generic goods in things made by God, whether in spirit or in body. God is,
therefore, above every measure of the creature, above every form, above every order, nor is
He above by local spaces, but by ineffable and singular potency, from whom is every measure,
every form, every order. These three things, where they are great, are great goods, where
they are small, are small goods; where they are absent, there is no good. And again where
these things are great, there are great natures, where they are small, there are small natures,
where they are absent, there is no nature. Therefore all nature is good.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="598"/>
<head>Chapter 4.—Evil is Corruption of Measure, Form, or Order.</head>
<p>When accordingly it is inquired, whence is evil, it must first be inquired, what is evil,
which is nothing else than corruption, either of the measure, or the form, or the order, that
belong to nature. Nature therefore which has been corrupted, is called evil, for assuredly
when incorrupt it is good; but even when corrupt, so far as it is nature it is good, so far as
it is corrupted it is evil.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="599"/>
<head>Chapter 5.—The Corrupted Nature of a More Excellent Order Sometimes Better
Than an Inferior Nature Even Uncorrupted.</head>
<p>But it may happen, that a certain nature which has been ranked as more excellent by
reason of natural measure and form, though corrupt, is even yet better than another incorrupt
which has been ranked lower by reason of an inferior natural measure and form: as in the
estimation of men, according to the quality which presents itself to view, corrupt gold is
assuredly better than incorrupt silver, and corrupt silver than incorrupt lead; so also in more
powerful spiritual natures a rational spirit even corrupted through an evil will is better than
an irrational though incorrupt, and better is any spirit whatever even corrupt than any body
whatever though incorrupt. For better is a nature which, when it is present in a body, furnishes
it with life, than that to which life is furnished. But however corrupt may be the
spirit of life that has been made, it can furnish life to a body, and hence, though corrupt, it
is better than the body though incorrupt.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="600"/>
<head>Chapter 6.—Nature Which Cannot Be Corrupted is the Highest Good; That Which
Can, is Some Good.</head>
<p>But if corruption take away all measure, all form, all order from corruptible things, no
nature will remain. And consequently every nature which cannot be corrupted is the highest
good, as is God. But every nature that can be corrupted is also itself some good; for corruption
cannot injure it, except by taking away from or diminishing that which is good.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="601"/>
<head>Chapter 7.—The Corruption of Rational Spirits is on the One Hand Voluntary, on
the Other Penal.</head>
<p>But to the most excellent creatures, that is, to rational spirits, God has offered this, that
if they will not they cannot be corrupted; that is, if they should maintain obedience under
the Lord their God, so should they adhere to his incorruptible beauty; but if they do not will
to maintain obedience, since willingly they are corrupted in sins, unwillingly they shall be
corrupted in punishment, since God is such a good that it is well for no one who deserts
Him, and among the things made by God the rational nature is so great a good, that there
is no good by which it may be blessed except God. Sinners, therefore, are ordained to
punishment; which ordination is punishment for the reason that it is not conformable to
their nature, but it is justice because it is conformable to their fault.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<pb n="602"/>
<head>Chapter 8.—From the Corruption and Destruction of Inferior Things is the Beauty
of the Universe.</head>
<p>But the rest of things that are made of nothing, which are assuredly inferior to the rational
soul, can be neither blessed nor miserable. But because in proportion to their fashion
and appearance are things themselves good, nor could there be good things in a less or the
least degree except from God, they are so ordered that the more infirm yield to the firmer,
the weaker to the stronger, the more impotent to the more powerful; and so earthly things
harmonize with celestial, as being subject to the things that are pre-eminent. But to things
falling away, and succeeding, a certain temporal beauty in its kind belongs, so that neither
those things that die, or cease to be what they were, degrade or disturb the fashion and appearance
and order of the universal creation; as a speech well composed is assuredly beautiful,
although in it syllables and all sounds rush past as it were in being born and in dying.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
<pb n="603"/>
<head>Chapter 9.—Punishment is Constituted for the Sinning Nature that It May Be Rightly
Ordered.</head>

there is no injustice on the part of God; because nature is better ordered by justly smarting
under punishment than by rejoicing with impunity in sin; which nature nevertheless, even
thus having some measure, form, and order, in whatever extremity there is as yet some
good, which things, if they were absolutely taken away, and utterly consumed, there will be

Therefore of whatever measure, of whatever form, of whatever order, they are, they are so
because it is God by whom they were made; but they are not immutable, because it is nothing
of which they were made. For it is sacrilegious audacity to make nothing and God equal,

is therefore good. So also we say that slow is contrary to swift, but yet he who does not move
at all cannot even be called slow. So we say that a heavy voice is contrary to a sharp voice,
or a harsh to a musical; but if you completely remove any kind of voice, there is silence
where there is no voice, which silence, nevertheless, for the simple reason that there is no
voice, is usually opposed to voice as something contrary thereto. So also lucid and obscure

Things, is Not an Evil.</head>
<p>For neither is that material, which the ancients called Hyle, to be called an evil. I do not
say that which Manichæus with most senseless vanity, not knowing what he says, denominates
Hyle, namely, the former of corporeal beings; whence it is rightly said to him, that he
introduces another god. For nobody can form and create corporeal beings but God alone;
for neither are they created unless there subsist with them measure, form, and order, which
I think that now even they themselves confess to be good things, and things that cannot be
except from God. But by Hyle I mean a certain material absolutely formless and without
quality, whence those qualities that we perceive are formed, as the ancients said. For hence
also wood is called in Greek ὕλη, because it is adapted to workmen, not that itself may make
anything, but that it is the material of which something may be made. Nor is that Hyle,
therefore, to be called an evil which cannot be perceived through any appearance, but can
scarcely be thought of through any sort of privation of appearance. For this has also a capacity
of forms; for if it cannot receive the form imposed by the workman, neither assuredly may
it be called material. Hence if form is some good, whence those who excel in it are called
beautiful,1088 as from appearance they are called handsome,1089 even the capacity of form
is undoubtedly something good. As because wisdom is a good, no one doubts that to be
capable of wisdom is a good. And because every good is from God, no one ought to doubt
that even matter, if there is any, has its existence from God alone.</p>

from Him each in its own measure. To Him who is highest, therefore nothing can be contrary,

<head>Chapter 20.—Pain Only in Good Natures.</head>
<p>But pain which some suppose to be in an especial manner an evil, whether it be in mind
or in body, cannot exist except in good natures. For the very fact of resistance in any being
leading to pain, involves a refusal not to be what it was, because it was something good; but
when a being is compelled to something better, the pain is useful, when to something worse,
it is useless. Therefore in the case of the mind, the will resisting a greater power causes pain;
in the case of the body, sensation resisting a more powerful body causes pain. But evils
without pain are worse: for it is worse to rejoice iniquity than to bewail corruption; yet even
such rejoicing cannot exist save from the attainment of inferior good things. But iniquity
is the desertion of better things. Likewise in a body, a wound with pain is better than painless
putrescence, which is especially called the corruption which the dead flesh of the Lord did
not see, that is, did not suffer, as was predicted in prophecy: "Thou shall not suffer Thy
Holy one to see corruption."1091 For who denies that He was wounded by the piercing of
the nails, and that He was stabbed with the lance?1092 But even what is properly called by
men corporeal corruption, that is, putrescence itself, if as yet there is anything left to consume,
increases by the diminution of the good. But if corruption shall have absolutely consumed
it, so that there is no good, no nature will remain, for there will be nothing that corruption
may corrupt; and so there will not even be putrescence, for there will be nowhere at all for
it to be.</p>

in any measure exist. Nor again ought God to be called measured, as if He received measure
from any one. But if we say that He is the highest measure, by chance we say something; if
indeed in speaking of the highest measure we mean the highest good. For every measure
in so far as it is a measure is good; whence nothing can be called measured, modest, modified,
without praise, although in another sense we use measure for limit, and speak of no measure
where there is no limit, which is sometimes said with praise as when it is said: "And of His
kingdom there shall be no limit."1095 For it might also be said, "There shall be no measure,"

<head>Chapter 23.—Whence a Bad Measure, a Bad Form, a Bad Order May Sometimes Be
Spoken of.</head>
<p>Therefore a bad measure, a bad form, a bad order, are either so called because they are
less than they should be, or because they are not adapted to those things to which they should
be adapted; so that they may be called bad as being alien and incongruous; as if any one
should be said not to have done in a good measure because he has done less than he ought,
or because he has done in such a thing as he ought not to have done, or more than was fitting,
or not conveniently; so that the very fact of that being reprehended which is done in a bad
measure, is justly reprehended for no other cause than that the measure is not there maintained.
Likewise a form is called bad either in comparison with something more handsome
or more beautiful, this form being less, that greater, not in size but in comeliness; or because
it is out of harmony with the thing to which it is applied, so that it seems alien and unsuitable.
As if a man should walk forth into a public place naked, which nakedness does not offend
if seen in a bath. Likewise also order is called bad when order itself is maintained in an inferior
degree. Hence not order, but rather disorder, is bad; since either the ordering is less
than it should be, or not as it should be. Yet where there is any measure, any form, any order,
there is some good and some nature; but where there is no measure, no form, no order,
there is no good, no nature.</p>

<head>Chapter 24.—It is Proved by the Testimonies of Scripture that God is Unchangeable.
The Son of God Begotten, Not Made.</head>
<p>Those things which our faith holds and which reason in whatever way has traced out,
are fortified by the testimonies of the divine Scriptures, so that those who by reason of feebler
intellect are not able to comprehend these things, may believe the divine authority, and so
may deserve to know. But let not those who understand, but are less instructed in ecclesiastical
literature, suppose that we set forth these things from our own intellect rather than
what are in those Books. Accordingly, that God is unchangeable is written in the Psalms:
"Thou shalt change them and they shall be changed; but Thou thyself art the same."1096
And in the book of Wisdom, concerning wisdom: "Remaining in herself, she renews all
things."1097 Whence also the Apostle Paul: "To the invisible, incorruptible, only God."1098
And the Apostle James: "Every best giving and every perfect gift is from above, descending
from the Father of light, with whom there is no changeableness, neither obscuring of influence."
1099 Likewise because what He begat of Himself is what He Himself is, it is said in
brief by the Son Himself: "I and the Father are one."1100 But because the Son was not made,
since through Him were all things made, thus it is written: "In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God, and God was the Word; this was in the beginning with God.

<p>For no attention should be paid to the ravings of men who think that nothing should
be understood to mean something, and moreover think to compel any one to vanity of this
kind on the ground that nothing is placed at the end of the sentence. Therefore, they say,
it was made, and because it was made, nothing is itself something. They have lost their
senses by zeal in contradicting, and do not understand that it makes no difference whether
it be said: "Without Him was made nothing," or "without Him nothing was made." For
even if the order were the last mentioned, they could nevertheless say, that nothing is itself
something because it was made. For in the case of what is in truth something, what difference
does it make if it be said "Without him a house was made," so long as it is understood that
something was made without him, which something is a house? So also because it is said:
"Without Him was made nothing," since nothing is assuredly not anything, when it is truly
and properly spoken, it makes no difference whether it be said: "Without Him was made
nothing or Without Him nothing was made," or "nothing was made." But who cares to
speak with men who can say of this very expression of mine "It makes no difference,"
"Therefore it makes some difference, for nothing itself is something?" But those whose
brains are not addled, see it as a thing most manifest that this something is to be understood
when it says "It makes no difference," as when I say "It matters in no respect." But these, if
they should say to any one, "What hast thou done?" and he should reply that he has done
nothing, would, according to this mode of disputation, falsely accuse him saying, "Thou
hast done something, therefore, because thou hast done nothing; for nothing is itself
something." But they have also the Lord Himself placing this word at the end of a sentence,
when He says: "And in secret have I spoken nothing." 1102 Let them read, therefore, and

Lord God made us."1105 And from this that is written in the Psalm: "He spake, and they
were made."1106 It is manifest, that not of Himself He begat these things, but that He made
them by word and command. But what is not of Himself is assuredly of nothing. For there
was not anything of which he should make them, concerning which the apostle says most

member suffers, all the members suffer with it;" also this he then says: "God has placed the
members each one of them in the body as he willed;" and "God has tempered the body,
giving to that to which it was wanting greater honor, that there should be no schism in the
body, but that the members should have the same care one for another."1111 But what the

out!"1112 Likewise because by the goodness of God sins are forgiven to the converted, the
very fact that Christ was sent sufficiently shows, who not in His own nature as God, but in
our nature, which He assumed from a woman, died for us; which goodness of God with
reference to us, and which love of God, the apostle thus sets forth: "But God commendeth
His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us; much more now
being justified in His blood we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if when we
were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more being
reconciled we shall be saved in His life."1113 But because even when due punishment is
rendered to sinners, there is no unrighteousness on God’s part, he thus says: "What shall
we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath?"1114 But in one place he has briefly

it is worthily done is written in the book of Job: "Who maketh to reign a man that is a hypocrite,
on account of the perversity of the people."1118 And concerning the people of Israel
God says: "I gave them a king in my wrath."1119 For it is not unrighteous, that the wicked
receiving the power of being hurtful, both the patience of the good should be proved and
the iniquity of the evil punished. For through power given to the Devil both Job was proved
so that he might appear righteous,1120 and Peter was tempted lest he should be presumptuous,

<head>Chapter 33.—That Evil Angels Have Been Made Evil, Not by God, But by Sinning.</head>
<p>But because evil angels also were not constituted evil by God, but were made evil by
sinning, Peter in his epistle says: "For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but casting
them down into the dungeons of smoky hell, He delivered them to be reserved for punishment
in judgment."1125 Hence Peter shows that there is still due to them the penalty of the
last judgment, concerning which the Lord says: "Go ye into everlasting fire, which has been
prepared for the Devil and his angels." Although they have already penally received this
hell, that is, an inferior smoky air as a prison, which nevertheless since it is also called
heaven, is not that heaven in which there are stars, but this lower heaven by the smoke of
which the clouds are conglobulated, and where the birds fly; for both a cloudy heaven is
spoken of, and flying things are called heavenly. As when the Apostle Paul calls those evil
angels, against whom as enemies by living piously we contend, "spiritual things of wickedness
in heavenly places."1126 That this may not be understood of the upper heavens, he plainly
says elsewhere: "According to the presence of the prince of this air, who now worketh in
the sons of disobedience."1127</p>

<head>Chapter 34.—That Sin is Not the Striving for an Evil Nature, But the Desertion of
a Better.</head>
<p>Likewise because sin, or unrighteousness, is not the striving after evil nature but the
desertion of better, it is thus found written in the Scriptures: "Every creature of God is
good."1128 And accordingly every tree also which God planted in Paradise is assuredly
good. Man did not therefore strive after an evil nature when he touched the forbidden tree;
but by deserting what was better, he committed an evil deed. Since the Creator is better
than any creature which He has made, His command should not have been deserted, that
the thing forbidden, however good, might be touched; since the better having been deserted,
the good of the creature was striven for, which was touched contrary to the command of
the Creator. God did not plant an evil tree in Paradise; but He Himself was better who
prohibited its being touched.</p>

<head>Chapter 35.—The Tree Was Forbidden to Adam Not Because It Was Evil, But Because

<p>For besides, He had made the prohibition, in order to show that the nature of the rational
soul ought not to be in its own power, but in subjection to God, and that it guards the order
of its salvation through obedience, corrupting it through disobedience. Hence also He called
the tree, the touching of which He forbade, the tree "of the knowledge of good and evil;"1129
because when man should have touched it in the face of the prohibition, he would experience
the penalty of sin, and so would know the difference between the good of obedience, and
the evil of disobedience.</p>

<head>Chapter 36.—No Creature of God is Evil, But to Abuse a Creature of God is Evil.</head>
<p>For who is so foolish as to think a creature of God, especially one planted in Paradise,
blameworthy; when indeed not even thorns and thistles, which the earth brought forth, according
to the judiciary judgment of God, for wearing out the sinner in labor, should be
blamed? For even such herbs have their measure and form and order, which whoever
considers soberly will find praiseworthy; but they are evil to that nature which ought thus
to be restrained as a recompense for sin. Therefore, as I have said, sin is not the striving
after an evil nature, but the desertion of a better, and so the deed itself is evil, not the nature
which the sinner uses amiss. For it is evil to use amiss that which is good. Whence the
apostle reproves certain ones as condemned by divine judgment, "Who have worshipped
and served the creature more than the Creator."1130 He does not reprove the creature, which
he who should do would act injuriously towards the Creator, but those who, deserting the
better, have used amiss the good.</p>

thus does he vanquish the will of God, who knows how to order righteously even the unrighteous;
so that if they themselves through the iniquity of their will should misuse His
good things, He through the righteousness of His power may use their evil deeds, rightly

for the punishment of sinners, yet it is mutable nature. But that is true eternity which is
true immortality, that is that highest immutability, which cannot be changed at all. For it
is one thing not to suffer change, when change is possible, and another thing to be absolutely
incapable of change. Therefore, just as man is called good, yet not as God, of whom it was
said, "There is none good save God alone;"1131 and just as the soul is called immortal, yet
not as God, of whom it was said, "Who alone hath immortality;"1132 and just as a man is

<head>Chapter 41.—How Great Good Things the Manichæans Put in the Nature of Evil,
and How Great Evil Things in the Nature of Good.</head>
<p>But if the Manichæans were willing, without pernicious zeal for defending their error,
and with the fear of God, to think, they would not most criminally blaspheme by supposing
two natures, the one good, which they call God, the other evil, which God did not make:
so erring, so delirious, nay so insane, are they that they do not see, that even in what they
call the nature of supreme evil they place so great good things: life, power, safety, memory,
intellect, temperance, virtue, plenty, sense, light, suavity, extensions, numbers, peace,
measure, form, order; but in what they call supreme good, so many evil things: death,
sickness, forgetfulness, foolishness, confusion, impotence, need, stolidity, blindness, pain,
unrighteousness, disgrace, war, intemperance, deformity, perversity. For they say that the
princes of darkness also have been alive in their own nature, and in their own kingdom were
safe, and remembered and understood. For they say that the Prince of Darkness harangued
in such a manner, that neither could he have said such things, nor could he have been heard
by those by whom he was said to have been heard, without memory and understanding;
and to have had a temper suitable to his mind and body, and to have ruled by virtue of
power, and to have had abundance and fruitfulness with respect to his elements, and they
are said to have perceived themselves mutually and the light as near at hand, and to have
had eyes by which they could see the light afar off; which eyes assuredly could not have seen
the light without some light (whence also they are rightly called light); and they are said to
have enjoyed exceedingly the sweetness of their pleasures, and to have been determined by
measured members and dwelling-places. But unless there had been some sort of beauty
there, they would not have loved their wives, nor would their bodies have been steady by
adaptation of parts; without which, those things could not have been done there which the
Manichæans insanely say were done. And unless some peace had been there, they would
not have obeyed their Prince. Unless measure had been there, they would have done nothing
else than eat or drink, or rage, or whatever they might have done, without any society: although
not even those that did these things would have had determinate forms, unless
measure had been there. But now the Manichæans say that they did such things that they
cannot be denied to have had in all their actions measures suitable to themselves. But if
form had not been there, no natural quality would have there subsisted. But if there had
been no order there, some would not have ruled, others been ruled; they would not have
lived harmoniously in their element; in fine, they would not have had their members adapted
to their places, so that they could not do all those things that the Manichæans vainly fable.
But if they say that God’s nature does not die, what according to their vanity does Christ
raise from the dead? If they say that it does not grow sick, what does He cure? If they say
that it is not subject to forgetfulness, what does He remind? If they say that it is not deficient
in wisdom, what does He teach? If they say that it is not confused, what does He restore?

<pb n="636"/>
If they say that it was not vanquished and taken captive, what does He liberate? If they say
that it was not in need, to what does He minister aid? If they say that it did not lose feeling,
what does He animate? If they say that it has not been blinded, what does He illuminate?
If it is not in pain, to what does He give relief? If it is not unrighteous, what does He correct
through precepts? If it is not in disgrace, what does He cleanse? If it is not in war, to what
does He promise peace? If it is not deficient in moderation, upon what does He impose the
measure of law? If it is not deformed, what does He reform? If it is not perverse, what does
He emend? For all these things done by Christ, they say, are to be attributed not to that
thing which was made by God, and which has become depraved by its own free choice in
sinning, but to the very nature, yea to the very substance of God, which is what God Himself
is.</p>

<head>Chapter 42.—Manichæan Blasphemies Concerning the Nature of God.</head>
<p>What can be compared to those blasphemies? Absolutely nothing, unless the errors of
other sectaries be considered; but if that error be compared with itself in another aspect, of
which we have not yet spoken, it will be convicted of far worse and more execrable blasphemy.
For they say that some souls, which they will have to be of the substance of God
and of absolutely the same nature, which have not sinned of their own accord, but have
been overcome and oppressed by the race of darkness, which they call evil, for combating
which they descended not of their own accord, but at the command of the Father, are fettered
forever in the horrible sphere of darkness. So according to their sacrilegious vaporings,
God liberated Himself in a certain part from a great evil, but again condemned Himself in
another part, which He could not liberate, and triumphed over the enemy itself as if it had
been vanquished from above. O criminal, incredible audacity, to believe, to speak, to proclaim
such things about God! Which when they endeavor to defend, that with their eyes shut they
may rush headlong into yet worse things, they say that the commingling of the evil nature
does these things, in order that the good nature of God may suffer so great evils: for that
this good nature in its own sphere could or can suffer no one of these things. As if a nature
were lauded as incorruptible, because it does not hurt itself, and not because it cannot suffer
hurt from another. Then if the nature of God hurt the nature of darkness, and the nature
of darkness hurt the nature of God, there are therefore two evil things which hurt each
other in turn, and the race of darkness was the better disposed, because if it committed hurt
it did it unwillingly; for it did not wish to commit hurt, but to enjoy the good which belonged
to God. But God wished to extinguish it, as Manichæus most openly raves forth in his epistle
of the ruinous Foundation. For forgetting that he had shortly before said: "But His most
resplendent realms were so founded upon the shining and happy land, that they could
never be either moved or shaken by any one;" he afterwards said: "But the Father of the
most blessed light, knowing that great ruin and desolation which would arise from the
darkness, threaten his holy worlds, unless he should send in opposition a deity excellent
and renowned, mighty in strength, by whom he might at the same time overcome and destroy
the race of darkness, which having been extinguished, the inhabitants of light would enjoy
perpetual rest." Behold, he feared ruin and desolation that threatened his worlds! Assuredly
they were so founded upon the shining and happy land that they never could be either
moved or shaken by any one? Behold, from fear he wished to hurt the neighboring race,
which he endeavored to destroy and extinguish, in order that the inhabitants of light might
enjoy perpetual rest. Why did he not add, and perpetual bondage? Were not these souls
that he fettered forever in the sphere of darkness, the inhabitants of light, of whom he says
plainly, that "they have suffered themselves to err from their former bright nature?" when
against his will he is compelled to say, that they sinned by free will, while he wishes to ascribe
sin only to the necessity of the contrary nature: everywhere ignorant what to say, and as if

<pb n="638"/>
he were himself already in the sphere of darkness which he invented, seeking, and not
finding, how he may escape. But let him say what he will to the seduced and miserable men
by whom he is honored far more highly than Christ, that at this price he may sell to them
such long and sacrilegious fables. Let him say what he will, let him shut up, as it were, in a
sphere, as in a prison, the race of darkness, and let him fasten outside the nature of light, to
which he promised perpetual rest on the extinction of the enemy: behold, the penalty of
light is worse than that of darkness; the penalty of the divine nature is worse than that of
the adverse race. But since although the latter is in the midst of darkness it pertains to its
nature to dwell in darkness; but souls which are the very same thing that God is, cannot be
received, he says, into those peaceful realms, and are alienated from the life and liberty of
the holy light, and are fettered in the aforesaid horrible sphere: whence he says, "Those
souls shall adhere to the things that they have loved, having been left in the same sphere of
darkness, bringing this upon themselves by their own deserts." Is not this assuredly free
voluntary choice? See how insanely he ignores what he says, and by making self-contradictory
statements wages a worse war against himself than against the God of the race of darkness
itself. Accordingly, if the souls of light are damned, because they loved darkness, the race
of darkness, which loved light, is unjustly damned. And the race of darkness indeed loved
light from the beginning, violently, it may be, but yet so as to wish for its possession, not its
extinction: but the nature of light wished to extinguish in war the darkness; therefore when
vanquished it loved darkness. Choose which you will: whether it was compelled by necessity
to love darkness, or seduced by free will. If by necessity, wherefore is it damned? if by free
will, wherefore is the nature of God involved in so great iniquity? If the nature of God was
compelled by necessity to love darkness, it did not vanquish, but was vanquished: if by free
will, why do the wretches hesitate any longer to attribute the will to sin to the nature which
God made out of nothing, lest they should thereby attribute it to the light which He begat?</p>

<head>Chapter 43.—Many Evils Before His Commingling with Evil are Attributed to the
Nature of God by the Manichæans.</head>
<p>What if we should also show that before the commingling of evil, which stupid fable
they have most madly believed, great evils were in what they call the nature of light? what
will it seem possible to add to these blasphemies? For before the conflict, there was the hard
and inevitable necessity of fighting: here is truly a great evil, before evil is commingled with
good. Let them say whence this is, when as yet no commingling had taken place? But if
there was no necessity, there was therefore free will: whence also this so great evil, that God
himself should wish to hurt his own nature, which could not be hurt by the enemy, by
sending it to be cruelly commingled, to be basely purged, to be unjustly damned? Behold,
the great evil of a pernicious, noxious, and savage will, before any evil from the contrary
nature was mingled with it! Or perchance he did not know that this would happen to his
members, that they should love darkness and become hostile to holy light, as Manichæus
says, that is, not only to their own God, but also to the Father from whom they had their
being? Whence therefore this so great evil of ignorance, before any evil from the nature of
darkness was mingled with it? But if he knew that this would happen, either there was in
him everlasting cruelty, if he did not grieve over the contamination and damnation of his
own nature that was to take place, or everlasting misery, if he did so grieve: whence also
this so great evil of your supreme good before any commingling with your supreme evil?
Assuredly that part of the nature itself which was fettered in the eternal chain of that sphere,
if it knew not that this fate awaited it, even so was there everlasting ignorance in the nature
of God, but if it knew, then everlasting misery: whence this so great evil before any evil
from the contrary nature was commingled? Or perchance did it, in the greatness of its love
(charity), rejoice that through its punishment perpetual rest was prepared for the residue
of the inhabitants of light? Let him who sees how abominable it is to say this, pronounce
an anathema. But if this should be done so that at least the good nature itself should not
become hostile to the light, it might be possible, perchance, not for the nature of God indeed,
but for some man, as it were, to be regarded as praiseworthy, who for the sake of his country
should be willing to suffer something of evil, which evil indeed could be only for a time, and
not forever: but now also they speak of that fettering in the sphere of darkness as eternal,
and not indeed of a certain thing but of the nature of God; and assuredly it were a most
unrighteous, and execrable, and ineffably sacrilegious joy, if the nature of God rejoiced that
it should love darkness, and should become hostile to holy light. Whence this so monstrous
and abominable evil before any evil from the contrary nature was commingled? Who can
endure insanity so perverse and so impious, as to attribute so great good things to supreme
evil, and so great evils to supreme good, which is God?</p>

<p>But now when they speak of that part of the nature of God as everywhere mixed up in
heaven, in earth, in all bodies dry and moist, in all sorts of flesh, in all seeds of trees, herbs,
men, and animals: not as present by the power of divinity, for administering and ruling all
things, undefilably, inviolably, incorruptibly, without any connection with them, which we
say of God; but fettered, oppressed, polluted, to be loosed and liberated, as they say, not
only through the running to and fro of the sun and the moon, and through the powers of
light, but also through their Elect: what sacrilegious and incredible turpitudes this kind of
error recommends to them even if it does not induce them to accept, it is horrible to speak
of. For they say that the powers of light are transformed into beautiful males and are set
over against the women of the race of darkness; and that the same powers again are transformed
into beautiful females and are set over against the males of the race of darkness; that
through their beauty they enkindle the foulest lust of the princes of darkness, and in this
manner vital substance, that is, the nature of God, which they say is held fettered in their
bodies, having been loosed from their members relaxed through lust, flies away, and when
it has been taken up or cleansed, is liberated. This the wretches read, this they say, this they
hear, this they believe, this they put as follows, in the seventh book of their Thesaurus (for
so they call a certain writing of Manichæus, in which these blasphemies stand written):
"Then the blessed Father, who has bright ships, little apartments, dwelling-places, or magnitudes,
according to his indwelling clemency, brings the help by which he is drawn out
and liberated from the impious bonds, straits, and torments of his vital substance. And so
by his own invisible nod he transforms those powers of his, which are held in this most
brilliant ship, and makes them to bring forth adverse powers, which have been arranged in
the various tracts of the heavens. Since these consist of both sexes, male and female, he orders
the aforesaid powers to bring forth partly in the form of beardless youths, for the adverse
race of females, partly in the form of bright maidens, for the contrary race of males: knowing
that all these hostile powers on account of the deadly and most foul lust innate in them, are
very easily taken captive, delivered up to these most beautiful forms which appear, and in
this manner they are dissolved. But you may know that this same blessed Father of ours is
identical with his powers, which for a necessary reason he transforms into the undefiled
likeness of youths and maidens. But these he uses as his own arms, and through them he
accomplishes his will. But there are bright ships full of these divine powers, which are sta-
tioned after the likeness of marriage over against the infernal races, and who with alacrity
and ease effect at the very moment what they have planned. Therefore, when reason demands
that these same holy powers should appear to males, straightway also they show by their
dress the likeness of most beautiful maidens. Again when females are to be dealt with,
putting aside the forms of maidens, they show the forms of beardless youths. But by this
handsome appearance of theirs, ardor and lust increase, and in this way the chain of their

<pb n="641"/>
worst thoughts is loosed, and the living soul which was held by their members, relaxed by
this occasion escapes, and is mingled with its own most pure air; when the souls thoroughly
cleansed ascend to the bright ships, which have been prepared for conveying them and for
ferrying them over to their own country. But that which still bears the stains of the adverse
race, descends little by little through billows and fires, and is mingled with trees and other
plants and with all seeds, and is plunged into divers fires. And in what manner the figures
of youths and maidens from that great and most glorious ship appear to the contrary powers
which live in the heavens and have a fiery nature; and from that handsome appearance, part
of the life which is held in their members having been released is conducted away through
fires into the earth: in the same manner also, that most high power, which dwells in the
ship of vital waters appears in the likeness of youths and holy maidens to those powers
whose nature is cold and moist, and which are arranged in the heavens. And indeed to
those that are females, among these the form of youths appears, but to the males, the form
of maidens. By his changing and diversity of divine and most beautiful persons, the princes
male and female of the moist and cold race are loosed, and what is vital in them escapes;
but whatever should remain, having been relaxed, is conducted into the earth through cold,
and is mingled with all the races of darkness" Who can endure this? Who can believe, not
indeed that it is true, but that it could even be said? Behold those who fear to anathematize
Manichæus teaching these things, and do not fear to believe in a God doing them and suffering
them!</p>

<head>Chapter 46.—The Unspeakable Doctrine of the Fundamental Epistle.</head>
<p>For they even say that Adam, the first man, was created by certain princes of darkness
so that the light might be held by them lest it should escape. For in the epistle which they
call Fundamental, Manichæus wrote as follows respecting the way in which the Prince of
Darkness, whom they represent as the father of the first man, spoke to the rest of his allied
princes of darkness, and how he acted: "Therefore with wicked inventions he said to those
present: What does this huge light that is rising seem to you to be? See how the pole moves,
how it shakes most of the powers. Wherefore it is right for me rather to ask you beforehand
for whatever light you have in your powers: since thus I will form an image of that great
one who has appeared in his glory, through which we may be able to rule, freed in some
measure from the conversation of darkness. Hearing these things, and deliberating for a
long time among themselves, they thought it most just to furnish what was demanded of
them. For they did not have confidence in being able to retain the light that they had forever;
hence they thought it better to offer it to their Prince, by no means without hope that in this
way they would rule. It must be considered therefore how they furnished the light that they
had. For this also is scattered throughout all the divine scriptures and the heavenly secrets;
but to the wise it is easy enough to know how it was given: for it is known immediately and
openly by him who should truly and faithfully wish to consider. Since there was a promiscuous
throng of those who had come together, females and males of course, he impelled
them to copulate among themselves: in which copulation the males emitted seed, the females
were made pregnant. But the offspring were like those who had begotten them, the first
obtaining as it were the largest portion of the parents’ strength. Taking these as a special
gift their Prince rejoiced. And just as even now we see take place, that the nature of evil
taking thence strength forms the fashioner of bodies, so also the aforesaid Prince, taking
the offspring of his companions, which had the senses of their parents, sagacity, light, procreated
at the same time with themselves in the process of generation, devoured them; and
very many powers having been taken from food of this kind, in which there was present not
only fortitude, but much more astuteness and depraved sensibilities from the ferocious race
of the progenitors, he called his own spouse to himself, springing from the same stock as
himself, emitted, like the rest the abundance of evils that he had devoured, himself also
adding something from his own thought and power, so that his disposition became the
former and arranger of all the things that he had poured forth; whose consort received these
things as soil cultivated in the best way is accustomed to receive seed. For in her were constructed
and woven together the images of all heavenly and earthly powers, so that what
was formed obtained the likeness, so to speak, of a full orb."</p>

<p>O abominable monster! O execrable perdition and ruin of deluded souls! I am not
speaking of the blasphemy of saying these things about the nature of God which is thus
fettered. Let the wretches deluded and hunted by deadly error give heed to this at least, that
if a part of their God is fettered by the copulation of males and females which they profess
to loose and purge by eating it, the necessity of this unspeakable error compels them not
only to loose and purge the part of God from bread and vegetables and fruits, which alone
they are seen publicly to partake of, but also from that which might be fettered through
copulation, if conception should take place. That they do this some are said to have confessed
before a public tribunal, not only in Paphlagonia, but also in Gaul, as I heard in Rome from
a certain Catholic Christian; and when they were asked by the authority of what writing
they did these things, they betrayed this fact concerning the Thesaurus that I have just
mentioned. But when this is cast in their teeth, they are in the habit of replying, that some
enemy or other has withdrawn from their number, that is from the number of their Elect,
and has made a schism, and has founded a most foul heresy of this kind. Whence it is
manifest that even if they do not themselves practise this thing, some who do practise it do
it on the basis of their books. Therefore let them reject the books, if they abhor the crime,
which they are compelled to commit, if they hold to the books; or if they do not commit
them, they endeavor in opposition to the books to live more purely. But what do they do
when it is said to them, either purge the light from whatever seeds you can, so that you
cannot refuse to do that which you assert that you do not do; or else anathematize
Manichæus, when he says that a part of God is in all seeds, and that it is fettered by copulation,
but that whatever of light, that is, of the aforesaid part of God, should become the food
of the Elect, is purged by being eaten. Do you see what he compels you to believe, and do
you still hesitate to anathematize him? What do they do, I say, when this is said to them?
To what subterfuges do they betake themselves, when either so nefarious a doctrine is to be
anathematized, or so nefarious a turpitude committed, in comparison with which all those
intolerable evils to which I have already called attention, seem tolerable, namely, that they
say of the nature of God that it was pressed by necessity to wage war, that it was either secure
by everlasting ignorance, or was disturbed by everlasting grief and fear, when the corruption
of commingling and the chain of everlasting damnation should come upon it, that finally
as a result of the conflict it should be taken captive, oppressed, polluted, that after a false
victory it should be fettered forever in a horrible sphere and separated from its original
blessedness, while if considered in themselves they cannot be endured?</p>

<head>Chapter 48.—Augustin Prays that the Manichæans May Be Restored to Their Senses.</head>
<p>O great is Thy patience, Lord, full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and
plenteous in mercy, and true;1135 who makest Thy sun to rise upon the good and the evil,
and who sendest rain upon the just and the unjust;1136 who willest not the death of the
sinner, so much as that he return and live;1137 who reproving in parts, dost give place to
repentance, that wickedness having been abandoned, they may believe on Thee, O Lord;1138
who by Thy patience dost lead to repentance, although many according to the hardness of
their heart and their impenitent heart treasure up for themselves wrath against the day of
wrath and of the revelation of Thy righteous judgment, who wilt render to every man according
to his works;1139 who in the day when a man shall have turned from his iniquity
to Thy mercy and truth, wilt forget all his iniquities:1140 stand before us, grant unto us that
through our ministry, by which Thou hast been pleased to refute this execrable and too
horrible error, as many have already been liberated, many also may be liberated, and
whether through the sacrament of Thy holy baptism, or through the sacrifice of a broken
spirit and a contrite and humbled heart,1141 in the sorrow of repentance, they may deserve
to receive the remission of their sins and blasphemies, by which through ignorance they
have offended Thee. For nothing is of any avail, save Thy surpassing mercy and power, and
the truth of Thy baptism, and the keys of the kingdom of heaven in Thy holy Church; so
that we must not despair of men as long as by Thy patience they live on this earth, who even
knowing how great an evil it is to think or to say such things about Thee, are detained in
that malign profession on account of the use or the attainment of temporal or earthly convenience,
if rebuked by Thy reproaches they in any way flee to Thy ineffable goodness, and
prefer to all the enticements of the carnal life, the heavenly and eternal life.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—An Analysis of Augustin’s Writings Against the
Donatists.</head>
<p>The object of this chapter is to present a rudimentary outline and summary of all that
Augustin penned or spoke against those traditional North African Christians whom he was
pleased to regard as schismatics. It will be arranged, so far as may be, in chronological order,
following the dates suggested by the Benedictine edition. The necessary brevity precludes
anything but a very meagre treatment of so considerable a theme. The writer takes no responsibility
for the ecclesiological tenets of the great Father, nor will he enter here into any
criticism of the text and truth of the documents, upon which the historical argument was
so laboriously and peremptorily built, to the utter ignoring of the Donatist archives, and
the protests of their scholars against the validity and integrity of their opponents’ records.
Both parties claimed to be the historic Catholic church; both were little apart in doctrine,
worship, and polity; both tended toward externalism in piety; both accused one another of
fraud in inventing records. Later Romanism in its bright spirit of selection took much spoil
from either camp.</p>
<p>The city of Augustin’s birth, its neighborhood, indeed the whole ecclesiastical province
of Numidia, was a stronghold for this puristic school. Is it not singular, then, that it seems
to have made no impression upon his early years? As a child he had witnessed its brief
restoration under Julian, and then the severe or lax efforts at suppression under succeeding
emperors; the Rogatian schism and the Tychonian reformation were quite familiar to him
in his Manichæan period; but the Confessions are silent as to any such stamp or hold upon
his mind. His activity begins with his ordination to the presbyterate, a time marked in
Donatist annals by the Maximianist separation, and increases as he becomes bishop. From
about 392 to near the close of his life, pen and voice were seldom still. In all those years the
outlinear thoughts grew in breadth and depth; endless are the forms in which his few and
radical conceptions manifest themselves; never does he lose sight of the popular effect, so
that he knows when to relax his love of word-play and delight in mysterious inductions, in
order to make the chief themes plain to the dullest mind.</p>
<p>How varied the channels through which he struggled for the mastery of his idea of the
Church! In the pulpit he made Donatism the occasion of many a polemic, many an appeal;
in his correspondence it was an ever-recurrent topic; it was the staple of many a tract and
book; verse was not shunned to destroy its fashionableness and popularity; commentaries
and manuals for the meditative hour or for the training of the theological student, abounded
in warnings against its aggressiveness; no opportunity for debate or conference or epistolary
discussion was left unimproved. And no wonder: it was a living thing, of the street, of the
market, of the social circle, of the home; it threatened at times to obliterate the transmarine
view of the church from North Africa; its spirit of political independence and plea for reli-

<pb n="653"/>
gious liberty went to the hearts of a people, more and more restive under the decline of the
Empire.</p>
<p>The literary creations of Donatism had been somewhat more fertile than that of Cæcilianism.
We must not belittle Donatus the Great, Parmenian, Petilian, Gaudentius, and
certainly the eminence of Tychonius is confessed by Augustin himself. Up to this time
Optatus of Milevis had been the only forcible opponent. But against the great Augustin
whom could they bring into the field? And against the great Augustin, backed by the energy
of the State, there was little hope of fairness. Augustin found a new and weighty school.
Donatism, with its impossible ideal, already began to despise the culture which seemed to
help its defeat and withdrew into its sensitive shell after the manner of all puristic tendencies
under persecution.</p>
<p>The two prevalent lines of attack are the historical on the origin of the schism, which
involved the dissection of the documents, and the doctrinal, or the discussion of the true
notes of the Church from the basis of the Scriptures. This latter Augustin preferred, because
final; he bowed to no patristic. One or the other or both may be traced in all his works,
great or small, against them. Out of so protracted a controversy there grew up a symmetrical
and comprehensive theory of the Church and the Sacraments on either side.</p>
<p>Of three fundamental points of Donatism, as perpetuated practices of North Africa,
rebaptism and the encouragement of a martyr spirit with its attendant feasts, the continuance
of the Seniores in the government of the Church, we find Augustin aiming mainly at the
overthrow of the first two. One of his earliest letters suggests to his bishop some means for
checking the drunkenness and great excess connected with the Natalitia. Passing to the
specific subject in view:</p>
<p>In the early period of his presbyterate, (possibly about 392, others place it later), Augustin
journeyed through Mutugenna, which apparently belonged to his bishop’s see. He learned
how pacifically disposed Maximin, Donatist bishop of Sinaita, was. The friendly feeling
thus kindled toward him was shaken by the rumor that he had rebaptized a defecting
Catholic deacon of Mutugenna; not willing to credit the story, he visited the deacon’s home.
His parents testified to their son’s reception into the same office by the Donatists. In the
absence of Bishop Valerius, he writes to Maximin with entreaty, refusing to credit the repetition
of the rite, and urging him to remain firm in the convictions which had been imputed
to him. He solicits a reply, that both letters may be read in the public service, after the dismission
of the military. The prominent points of the letter are: while declining to recognize
the validity of Maximin’s orders, he does not refuse to salute him as Dominus dulcissimus,
and Pater venerabilis. His solicitude as a shepherd to do his duty to all the sheep, constrains
him to force himself upon their attention, and to be eager for correspondence or conference
with a view to bringing them back to the fold. He is perfectly assured of the absolute and
final correctness of his idea of the Church, and of the hopeless error of Donatism, an error

<pb n="654"/>
so great as to merit eternal destruction. He discriminates, however, between heresy and
schism at this time. Rebaptism in any case is a sin, but as applied to apostatizing Catholics,
is an immanissimum scelus. There is only one baptism; that of Christ; as there was no double
circumcision, so the sacrament of the New Testament should not be repeated. The Church
is the owner of the nations which are Christ’s inheritance, and of the ends of the earth, which
are his possession; hence it is universal; the seamless robe should not be rent. Moreover
the Lord’s threshing-floor has chaff upon it along with the wheat, and therefore he urged
the disuse of imputations through unworthy members on either side, whether Macarius or
Circumcelliones. The schism made itself disastrously felt in all domestic and social relations.
He engages to avoid anything that would look like using the power of the state for coercing
conscience, and begs that on Maximin’s side the Circumcelliones may be restrained. <del>Ep.
xxiii.</del></p>
<p>A Plenary council of all Africa was convened in Hippo-Regius in 393, before which
Augustin preached the sermon. His subject was Faith and the Creed: his handling made
such an impression that he was induced to expand it into the treatise: De Fide et Symbolo.
In explaining the article credimus et sanctam ecclesiam, utique catholicam, he reflects on
heretics and schismatics as claiming the title of churches for their congregations; and distinguishes
between these two opponents of the Catholic body, heretics erring in doctrine,
schismatics, while similar to the Catholic body in views of truth yet transgressing in the
rupture of fraternal love. Neither pertain to the true Church of God. (Cp. Retractt. I. xvii).</p>
<p>Determined if possible to win the ear of all classes, the presbyter next affected a poem,
"Psalmus contra Partem Donati," in the art of an Abecedarium, running the letters to U.
The line with which it began was to be chanted as a refrain after each group of usually twelve
lines connected with each letter, the whole closing with an extended epilogue. A generally
vulgar performance it is, and purposely disclaimed all metrical dignity; and yet it contains
the germs of his logical and historical opinions on the controverted points. The Church is
a net in the sea of the world, enclosing the good and bad, which are not to be separated until
the net is drawn to the shore. Those who accuse the Catholics of tradition, were themselves
traditors and broke the net. The history is repeated, and all proof of the Donatist charges
declared to be wanting. Unity is a note of the Church, and toleration within the net essential
to its preservation. Over against Macarius he puts the violent Circumcelliones. The wicked
members of the Church do not contaminate the good by a communion which is only outward
and not of the heart. The threshing-floor has chaff upon it; wheat and tares must grow together.
The Catholics rear the Elijah altar, the Donatist the Baal altar over against it. Christ
endured Judas. Why rebaptize us, he exclaims, when you do not repeat the rite upon your
once expelled but now restored Maximianists? Surely it is better to draw life from the real
root. The character of him who administers the sacrament has nothing to do with its effi-

<pb n="655"/>
ciency; and so he returns to the necessity for toleration within the net, as Judas was forborne
in the apostolic company. The epilogue pictures the personified Church expostulating with
the Donatists for quarreling with their Mother, and presents a loose summary of the previous
arguments.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether, even in the fashion of the times, so lengthy a poem could become
a street theme, or find many repeaters in the markets and inns of Hippo or Carthage, although
the refrain for peace and truthful judgment might catch the ear of the more zealous. <del>Cp.
Retractt. I. xx.</del>.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Carthage, Donatus the Great, the sphinx of Donatism, had written a book
to vindicate the claim of his church to the only Christian baptism. The work obtained
considerable currency, and maintained its authority, even in Augustin’s day, so he answered
it during the year 393, most probably, in a treatise of one book now no longer extant, but
which has been given the title: "Contra Epistolam Donati hæretici," The Retractations (I.
xxi.) correct some points which had been held in this work. (1). According to the Ambrosian
view, Augustin here identified Peter with the rock, on which the Church was to be built;
but afterwards he regarded that rock as Christ, who was the subject of the Petrine confession;
on Christ was the Church to be built, and to the Church as thus reared, were given the keys.
(2). The Donatus present at the Roman Synod, he had spoken of as the bishop of Carthage,
the author of the book, which error is corrected in the Retractations. (3). He had also charged
the writer with falsifying a favorite passage of their side, Ecclus. xxxiv. 30, but afterwards
found that some codices read according to the Donatist quotation, and apologizes for his
assertions.</p>
<p>Doubtless many of the sermons preached during his presbyterate had reference to the
schism, but the chronology of these is too uncertain to allow of any definite arrangement.
We pass to the period of his co-bishopric with the aged Valerius, which dates from 395
A.D.</p>
<p>Evodius, a brother connected with the Church at Hippo Regius, had a chance meeting
with Proculeianus, bishop of the Donatist body in that diocese. The two fell into a discussion
of their mutual differences. Evodius spoke in rather a lofty and censorious way, after the
fashion of his side, and wounded the feelings of the older disputant, for the Donatists, like
all kindred bodies, cultivated an undue sensitiveness and were altogether too ready to take
offense. Proculeianus, however, expressed a perfect readiness to have a friendly debate with
Augustin in the presence of competent men. In view of this suggestion, and in the absence
of Valerius, Augustin, always anxious to improve such an opening, addressed a letter to
Proculeianus (c. 396), with courteous recognition, and no such sharp denial of the episcopal
function as in the case of Maximin. He apologizes for the severe language of his friend, and
in every way avoids any expression which might cause the tendrils again to be drawn in.
The methods suggested for discussion show the anxiety of Augustin to beat out the fire of

<pb n="656"/>
Donatism; there is the debate before chosen hearers, all the statements to be written out for
use; or there is the private discussion through mutual discourse, to be read to one another
and corrected, and so given to the people; or the single correspondence with a view to public
lections, or any possible way that the aged bishop himself might prefer. He urges that the
dead bury their dead, and the past history be left out of the debate; the present with its
burning dissensions affords sufficient topics. As the people seek the bishop to arbitrate in
their private litigations, let these worthies cultivate peace in this broader field; to this end
he invites to prayer and conference. (Ep. xxxiii.).</p>
<p>Apparently the letter led to nothing practical. A new turn was given to matters. A son
had beaten his mother, and threatened her life; to avoid Catholic discipline, he joined the
Donatists and was rebaptized by them: as Augustin says, he wounded also his spiritual
mother by contemning her sacrament. Public registration of the facts were made by Augustin,
all the more because the reported instructions, given by bishop Proculeianus to his presbyter
Victor concerning the affair, had already been denied. The case presented an opportunity
for getting at some rule for the recognition of one another’s discipline. Accordingly Augustin
addresses himself to Eusebius, a judicious Donatist of higher rank. He professes that his
aim is peace; he emphasizes with impatient vehemence his opposition to coercive measures
in matters of conscience: neque me id agere ut ad communionem catholicam quisquam
cogatur invitus. He asks Eusebius to find out whether Proculeianus had given the order to
his presbyter as recorded; whether the bishop would consent to a collation between themselves
and ten selected men on each side, agreeably to the original suggestion so that the
whole question might be discussed from the Scriptural grounds, not the historical. Some
proposals for a meeting either at the Donatist region of Constantina, or at their projected
council at Milevis, he could not accept, because both lay outside of his diocese. If Proculeianus
objected to the dialectic and rhetorical skill of his counter bishop, the latter would
propose Samsucius, bishop of Turris, an earnest but uncultivated man, as a substitute to
lead the Catholic side. (Ep. xxxiv.).</p>
<p>Eusebius declined to interfere on the ground that he could not be a judge, so Augustin
replies (Ep. xxxv.) that he had only asked him to make some inquiries, because the bishop
refused to have any direct communication. The need for some adjustment concerning discipline
had become very pressing; a Catholic subdeacon and some nuns under rebuke had
been received into full standing by the Donatists, yet their subsequent career had been even
more scandalous. Augustin claimed that the Catholics always respected the penal enactments
of their opponents. To show his own hostility to compulsory conversions, he cites the case
of a daughter, who against the paternal will had joined the Donatists, and had professed
among them; when the father was about to use violence for her recall, he was dissuaded by
Augustin, and when a presbyter of Proculeianus had shouted abusive epithets at him, al-

<pb n="657"/>
though upon the property of a Catholic woman, he neither replied nor allowed others to
resent the insult.</p>
<p>A practical treatise is ascribed by some to this time, called de Agone Christiano. In expounding
the faith he warns against different groups of heretics and schismatics. In Chap.
xxix. 31, he cautions against listening to the Donatist party, who deny the one holy Catholic
church to be diffused throughout the whole world, and claim it to be alone in Africa, and
there among themselves, against the plain Scripture teaching of its universality; they affirm
that the prophecies of its extension have already been fulfilled, after which the whole church
perished outside of their remnant. He alludes to the divisions which have befallen them as
a retribution for their separation. If the end shall come after the preaching of the gospel to
all nations, how can all nations have lapsed from the faith, when there remain some who
are yet to hear and believe? This system robs Christ of His glory, and is to be avoided by all
who love the Church. (Cp. Retractt. II. iii.).</p>
<p>In 397 A.D., at the death of Valerius, he became sole bishop. In this year, while on a
visit to Tibursi, he had met with Glorius and other Donatists, with whom he held a friendly
disputation on the origin and history of the schism, during which some Donatist documents
were produced which he declared to be false, and from memory recapitulated the archives
current on his side. Augustin pursued his journey to Gelizi, where he attended to some
episcopal duties, and brought back with him a copy of the Catholic Gesta, and spent a day
with these friends in reading them, but could not quite finish. He subsequently reproduces
this story with the arguments in a letter. (Ep. xliii.). The chief burden is a criticism of the
Acts, highly important in its place, but it must be passed by here save to remark that in
speaking of Bishop Secundus, he suggests that it would have been better to appeal to the
principalities of Rome or of some other apostolic church, than to have proceeded as he did;
he should have preserved the unity at all hazards; had the case been inexplicable, he should
have left it to God; if definable, he should have addressed the transmarine bishops, after
finding that his peers at home could not adjust the difficulty; disobedience on the part of
Cæcilian to such an order, would have made him the author of the schism; but now the
Donatist altar is set up against the Universal Church. It may be well to note that throughout
the survey of these acts, there appears a manifest contradiction as to the beginning of the
appellations. In the next place, the Donatists are held guilty of schism, rebaptism, and resistance
to civil correction; of non-communion with those churches concerning whom they
read in their lections; and of the demand for purism against the Lord’s parable. The angels
of the churches in the apocalypse are ecclesiastical powers, not heavenly messengers. The
Church cannot be charged with the crimes of the evil men in it. Toleration is the only
practice by which unity can be conserved; Moses bore with murmurers, David with Saul,
Samuel with the sons of Eli, Christ with Judas. They themselves forbear with Circumcelliones,
with Optatus bishop of Thamugada. The emphasis, however, is not so much upon those

<pb n="658"/>
matters as upon schism. He would rather leave the archives and elucidate the doctrine, in
which he claims to have the book of the world; that the Catholics are the Lord’s inheritance;
that they stand in fellowship with the churches of the New Testament; they are the light of
the world. A divine rebuke has befallen Donatism in all the tenets of its particularity, by
the schism and return of the Maximianists.</p>
<p>No open door was passed by. On a journey to Cirta, possibly about the beginning of
398 A.D., he visited with clerical friends the aged Donatist, bishop Fortunius, at Tibursi.
A great company gathered who interrupted the debate; all attempts at taking notes were finally
given up. In a letter (Ep. xliv.) to the Donatists, Eleusius, Glorius, and the two Felixes,
who were of the number of those addressed in the previous epistle, he speaks of their witness
to the conciliatory disposition of Fortunius, and recounts the substance of the interview,
with the desire that it may be submitted to that bishop for correction. The discussion had
opened with the question of the Church. Fortunius regretted that Augustin was not in it;
the latter reversed the wish. What is the Church? Is it diffused throughout the whole world,
or is it confined to Africa? Can the Donatists send letters of communion to any of the
apostolic churches? Thence they dissected the Donatist claim to be the people of God, on
account of their subjection to persecution; in which it appears that they recorded the schism
of the whole world from themselves as the true Church as due to sympathy with the Macarian
persecution; up to that time they had held fellowship with the whole world, and as proof
thereof brought forward a letter of a council of Sardica addressed to them. From the condemnation
of Athanasius and Julius by this document, Augustin, to whom it was new,
concluded that this was an Arian council, and was only the more damaging to their theory.
The note of persecution being resumed, he maintained that there was no approved suffering
unless for a just cause, and hence the justice of the cause must first be established. Though
Ambrose had endured violence at the hand of the soldiery, they would deny him to be a
Christian, for they would rebaptize even him. Maximianists on the other hand were confessed
to be just, although they had been dispossessed of their basilicas by the Primianist appeal
to the state. As an offset, Fortunius urged the curious fact that before the election of Majorinus,
an interventor had been chosen, whom the Cæcilianists put out of the way. On the
following day Augustin had to confess that there was no example in the New Testament to
justify compulsion in matters of faith. The next topic was Discipline. Augustin pleaded for
toleration in order to keep unity. A point as to Johannic baptism sprang up, but was not
pressed. From this time the debate became miscellaneous and repetitious; in its progress
Fortunius confessed reluctantly that rebaptism was a fixed practice among them, and that
even a Catholic bishop so highly esteemed among the Donatists for his non-persecuting

<pb n="659"/>
spirit as was Genethlius, would have to submit to the rite before he could be recognized by
their body. Augustin proposes a further examination of matters, with a view to peace, but
the pacific Fortunius doubts whether many of the so-called Catholics really desire concord,
to which Augustin replies that he can find ten men who would heartily enter into such a
conference.</p>
<p>On the next day the venerable Donatist calls upon his opponent to resume their talk,
until an ordination called Augustin away; we also obtain information of the Coelicolæ professing
a new sort of baptism, with whose leader he desired to confer. The letter closes with
a proposition to meet in the little village of Titia, near Tibursi, where there was no church,
and the population pretty equally divided, and where no crowd could disturb the progress
of the investigation; thither all documents should be brought and the whole subject canvassed
for as long a time as it might take to terminate the discussion.
During the year Augustin issued a weighty work, which stands closely related to these
visits to Fortunius. It was in two books named by himself: Contra partem Donati. Unhappily
it is lost, but in the Retractations (II. v.), he says, that in the first book he had opposed the
use of the secular power for compelling the schismatics to return to the communion of the
State Church, a form of discipline which experience afterwards persuaded him was necessary
and wholesome.</p>
<p>Possibly it was at the close of the year 398 that a hint from the Donatist bishop Honoratus
was brought by Herotes to Augustin, to the effect that they carry on a correspondence on
the questions in dispute between them, and avoid the uproar of public debates. Augustin
acquiesces heartily, and at once plunges (Ep. xlix.) into the doctrinal aspect of the matter.
He begins with the note of Universality, the Church is diffused through the whole world,
to establish which he brings forward some of his key passages, Ps. ii. 7, 8, Matt. xxiv. 14,
Rom. i. 5. With all the apostolic churches Catholics communicate, Donatists do not. How
then can this universality be limited? Why call the Catholic church Macarian, when the
name of Macarius or Donatus is not known in any of these gospel regions? It rests with
Donatists to prove how the Church is lost from the whole world and is confined to them.
Catholics can rely on the Scriptures only for their theory. Correspondence seems to him
also the better plan for discussion. Whether this mutual approach went further is not known.</p>
<p>It may have been in 399 A.D. that the Donatist presbyter Crispinus had met Augustin
at Carthage; the two joined words, and both seem to have become heated; the former made
promise to resume the parley at a later date, to the fulfillment of which the bishop had occasionally
urged him. When Crispinus was elevated to the see of Calama, c. 400 A.D., and
was not far from Augustin’s diocese, the latter addressed him a letter (Ep. li.) rehearsing
these facts. A new rumor credited Crispinus with being ready to enter the arena once more.
All salutation is avoided in Augustin’s letter, because the Donatists had accused him of
servility. For the sake of accuracy and instruction he proposes simply to correspond,

<pb n="660"/>
whether by one interchange of letters or by many. He pleads that present interests alone
may be touched upon. Schism according to the Old Testament was more severely punished
than idolatry or the burning of the sacred scroll. The charge of traditorship is set off by the
acceptance of the Maximianists, whom the council of Bagai had condemned in such severe
terms. If a mistake was made with regard to them why not in Cæcilian’s case? If these were
really guilty, you consulted the wider duties of unity and toleration, and why not carry these
principles farther and apply them to communion with the Catholics? As to the charge of
persecution, Augustin will not enter into the merits of the matter theoretically, nor stop to
plead the mildness of the measures used, but at once asks why the Donatists used the State
to dislodge the Maximianists, and to deny the Catholics the possession of genuine baptism
is made foolish by the recognition of the rite as existing among the Maximianists who had
been cut off, and were restored without a renewal of the ceremony. The whole world had
been condemned by the Donatists without an opportunity of being heard, and yet they accept
the sacrament of the condemned Felicianus and Prætextatus. While they deny the validity
of the symbol as administered by apostolic communions, and by the missionary churches
which brought the light to Africa, they maintain that their little fraction alone is its possessor.
Summarizing these arguments as a weight for the bishop to stagger under, he invokes the
peace of Christ to conquer his heart.</p>
<p>In this same year one of his relatives, Severinus, who was a Donatist, sent a communication
to him at Hippo by a special messenger, with a view of reopening friendly intercourse
with his kinsman; and Augustin seizes it as a way to reestablish as well the higher kinship
in Christ (Ep. lii.). The Church is an unconcealable city set on a hill; it is Catholic, being
diffused throughout the whole world. The party of Donatus is cut off from the historic root
of the Oriental churches, and therefore cannot bring forth the fruits of peace and love; indeed
it suppresses Christ by its rebaptism. Had their charges been genuine the transmarine
bishops would have supported them; at any rate they should not have withdrawn from the
Unity, but rather have practiced toleration. He hopes that the bonds of custom may be
broken by Severinus, and that both may find their truest relationship in Christ, since the
state of schism is a despising of the eternal heritage and of perpetual salvation.</p>
<p>Further along in the year, a Donatist presbyter had sent to Generosus an ordo Christianitatis,
or episcopal succession of Constantina, his native city, asserting that it had been
delivered by an angel from heaven. About nothing were the church externalists of every
camp so eager as the preservation of the succession in proof of antiquity. Generosus had
only laughed at the man’s stupidity, but nevertheless wrote to the bishop of Hippo about
it. Fortunatus, Alypius and Augustin combine in a reply, undeniably written by the latter,
commending him (Ep. liii.). The ordo Christianitatis of the whole world is theirs, from
which the Donatists do not hesitate to separate themselves. This presbyter’s fiction would
have to be rejected at any rate, even had it come from an angel, since all other gospels than

<pb n="661"/>
that which teaches the universality of the Church are anathema. That doctrine is in Matt.
xxiv. 14, Gen. xii. 3, Gal. iii. 16. The true ordo is the Roman, which he gives from Peter to
Anastasius, the cotemporary pope; no Donatist is found in this list; yet as Montenses and
Cutzupitæ, they have intruded into Rome. Had there been an actual tradition, or any wicked
man in the Church, that would not have vitiated the ordo, or the Church, for the law of
Christ is plain, Matt. xxiii. 3, a passage again and again quoted by Augustin to substantiate
this thought. They are separated from the peace of these very churches, concerning which
they read in their codices, and sing pax tecum. There follows a very full and notable summary
of the acts, as a refutation of the schism. He prefers the Scriptural proofs, which certify to
the world-wide reach of Christ’s inheritance, and its existence among all nations; from this
they are separated by a nefarious schism, and charge upon the Catholics the crimes of the
chaff on the threshing-floor, which must be mixed with the grain until the winnowing; these
accusations do not affect the wheat which grows with the tares in the field until the end.
Their divinely appointed retribution is in the history of the Maximianists, with whom they
now commune, and affirm that they are not stained thereby; let them apply that lenity of
judgment to the inheritance of Christ. The angel then was either Satan, or the man is
Satanic, yet his salvation is desired; the sharp writing concerning him is without odium,
and seeks only his correction.</p>
<p>Celer was a Donatist, a man of middle age and of considerable estate and civil position.
He afterwards rose to the proconsulship. Augustin expresses (Ep. lvi.) a peculiar respect
and affection for him, as a man of integrity and seriousness. He had desired direct instruction
from the bishop, both in a matter of Christian culture and in the controversies between the
two parties. Weighed down with the cares of visitation, Augustin had to delegate his presbyter
Optatus to the reading and explanations of the bishop’s works and views in Celer’s
leisure hours. The superior claims of the life beyond are set before him, together with the
overwhelming force of the proofs against the schism, so that the dullest with patience and
attention can get correction. The sundering of the bonds of custom and of a perversity that
has become familiar, is a matter requiring great strength of character, for which step however,
he, under God, would be readily capable.</p>
<p>But Celer was not persuaded to change his church connection by this first endeavor.
On the contrary, Augustin thought he saw a laxity in the enforcement of the repressive
measure ordered by the government, and so wrote a second time (Ep. lvii.). He affirms that
there is no just cause for separation from that Catholic church which prophets and evangelist
have declared should be diffused through the whole world. A long retained codex of Augustin,
which had been loaned to Celer through Cæcilian, his own son, who seems to have
been under the special tutelage of the bishop, was designed to convince the state official on
this very point (we do not know which writing it may have been), should inclination or
leisure lead him to its perusal, and whatever difficulties might occur, Augustin was ready

<pb n="662"/>
to answer. He desires him also to stir up his subordinates to greater care in restoring the
Catholic unity in the region of Hippo; indeed he cautions him to diligence on his own estates;
a friend there, who fears to be strict in the carrying out of the statutes, could have his position
alleviated by a word from Celer his patron. From this point we notice a decided sympathy
with the effort to break up Donatism by force.</p>
<p>Parmenian, the successor of Donatus the Great in the see of Carthage, was one of the
brightest disputants on their side. Against him Optatus of Milevis had directed his review
of the schism, full indeed of grave historical blunders, but not lacking in that suavity which
those who think they have the keys of heaven sometimes affect. When Tychonius had exposed
some of the inconsequences and weaknesses of the Donatist theory of the Church,
Parmenian undertook a reply, whose main object was to fortify the propositions, (1) that
the evil defile the good in the Church, and must therefore be cut off; and (2) that puristic
folly, that the Donatist community was absolutely pure in its membership and priesthood.
To this much-esteemed work, Augustin replies (c. 400 A.D.) in three books: Contra Epistolam
Parmeniani.</p>
<p>In Book I. the main question is, who really incurred the guilt of schism, and initiated
the appeal to the State? He opens with the praise of Tychonius as man and author, but
misses the acute drift of that great man’s argument. He seeks to answer the data of the origin
of the separation as given by Parmenian, who attributes it to the joint movement of Gaul,
Spain and Italy in seeking to make their views universal, and to the influence of Hosius over
Constantine, in winning him to their opinion; nor does Parmenius cease to deprecate the
imperial intervention. Augustin defends this use of the secular arm, but accuses the
Donatists by their history of beginning it in the appeal to Constantine, in the treatment of
the Rogatists and Maximianists, in the abuses of the Circumcelliones, in their petition to
Julian.</p>
<p>Book II. discusses the texts alleged by the Donatists in support of the purity of the
Church, the need of discipline, the sole validity of their baptism and ordination, the
blamelessness of their members and clergy. While both fail in exegetical principles, Parmenian,
after the manner of his school, is aggravatingly guilty of using mere catch-words, without
regard to text or context. He quotes indiscriminately whatever sounds favorable to his
cause. Some of the passages are: Is. v. 20, Prov. xvii. 15, Is. lix. 1–8, Ecclus. x. 2, Is. lxvi. 3,
Prov. xxi. 27, and others. Augustin gives his interpretations, and does not fail to prod his
opponent with barbs of Optatus, Maximianists, and Circumcelliones.</p>
<p>Book III. handles further the theory of purism in the light of Scriptural proofs. The first
part is mainly an endeavor to give the true significance of I Cor. v. 12, 13. (Compare his
correction in the Retractt. II. xvii.). Augustin is constrained to confess the need of some
internal discipline, and then enforces with wider range the notes of universality, unity and
toleration, especially as illustrated by Cyprian. <del>Cp. Retractt.. II. xvii.</del>.</p>

<pb n="663"/>
<p>In the work against Parmenian, he had promised to write more fully on this subject of
baptism, the frequent persuasions of the brethren also moved him so that in this same year
(400 A.D.) he issued the seven books De Baptismo: Contra Donatistas. The double purpose
is to define that sacrament as the property of Christ, and to overthrow the Donatist appeal
to the authority of Cyprian and the famous council of Carthage, with its eighty-seven deliverances
in favor of the repetition of the rite. Since this is one of the works translated in the
accompanying volume any further analysis may be passed by. <del>Cp. Retractt. II. xviii.</del>.</p>
<p>In this period of frequent and heated controversy, a Donatist layman, Centurius by
name, brought some of their quotations and writings, and supported with Scriptural proofs
to the Church in Hippo. It seems to have begun with an exposition of Prov. ix. 17. (N. Afr.
version and LXX). Augustin answered them briefly in a tractate, which he entitles: Contra
quod attulit Centurius a Donatistis. It is however not extant. In the Retractations (II. xix.)
it is placed immediately after the work on Baptism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and as the Retractations tell us, before he had finished his work on the
Trinity, and his literal commentary on Genesis, he found it desirable to reply to the pastoral
letter of Petilian, Donatist bishop of Constantina; unfortunately only a part of the epistle
came into his hand, so strenuous and vigilant were the efforts to hide their literature from
the eyes of this ardent foe. He replied with one book to so much as he had received, c. 400
A.D. Some of his clergy subsequently obtained and wrote out a complete copy, so that he
composed the second book, c. 401 A.D. Meanwhile Petilian responded to the first issue,
and this necessitated a third book, c. 401 or 402 A.D. The three books were collected into
one treatise, and are known under the title Contra Litteras Petiliani. The main object of
the series is the refutation of Petilian’s proposition: "Conscientia namque (sancte) dantis
attenditur, quæ (qui) abluat accipientis." "Nam qui fidem (sciens) a perfido sumpserit, non
fidem percipit, sed reatum." "What we look for is the conscience of the giver (him who gives
in holiness), to cleanse that of the recipient." "For he who (wittingly) receives faith from
the faithless receives not faith, but guilt." Since the work is also a part of this volume, we
need not dwell on it farther. <del>Cp. Retractt. II. xxv.</del></p>
<p>The civil restraints were applied with vigor on the one side and resented on the other
by the retaliatory Circumcelliones. To Pammachius, a man of senatorial rank, Augustin,
in 401 A.D., sends a letter [Ep. lviii.] of exuberant congratulations and flatteries, because he
had compelled some of his Numidian tenants to return to the mother Church; a converting
agency which he condemns unmercifully when practiced by the Donatists. The plan, he
says, would have been urged upon other landholders, had the clergy not been afraid of the
scornful finger of the Donatists, who were in such favor with the proprietors, that an effort
like this might have failed. He desires the senator to circulate this letter wherever there was
promise of effect. The bishop, now thoroughly committed to these arbitrary procedures,
was in some trepidation lest the plausible arguments which the Donatists were urging, might

<pb n="664"/>
shake the resolution of Pammachius himself, and so he sends a secret commission of instruction.</p>
<p>The coercive measures yielded fruit, and the question about the status of recedent
Donatist clergy now became pressing. Augustin had already met with a certain Theodore
on this subject, and in a letter addressed to him <del>Ep. lxi.</del> c. 401, recapitulated the proposition
then agreed upon, to be used as a basis for treatment with all who wanted to come over.
The Catholic church opposed only the schism and the rebaptism among the Donatists; what
was good she was ready to acknowledge. Baptism itself, ordination, self-denial, celibacy,
doctrinal views, especially as to the Trinity, these were confessedly right, only to reap the
profit of them, it was essential for Donatists to be in the unity and in the root.</p>
<p>The Council of Carthage of September 13, 401, adopted this view, Can. 2. There had
also been a remarkable scarcity of Catholic clergy, so that application had been made to
Rome and Milan for relief; probably this had its influence upon so charitable a view of
schismatic ordination.</p>
<p>It was alleged that Crispinus, the bishop of Calama, had bought a state farm at Mappalia,
and had rebaptized the tenants. Augustin was roused by this counter-irritant and wrote
him a letter, c. 402 A.D. <del>Ep. lxvi.</del>, wondering what he would do if the authorities were to
impose the fine for every offense. He pleads for an answer to Christ, whose was all the world,
because bought with his blood, while the Donatist would affirm that Christ had lost all the
world save Africa. He urges a public discussion of the mooted points before these converts,
which should be reported and done into Punic as a test of their freedom in this conversion,
and frankly enough offers to do the same for any case of coercion on his side. Unless
Crispinus and his helpers acquiesce, he will hold them guilty.</p>
<p>The uppermost talk of those times was the extraordinary charity of the Donatists toward
the Maximianists. One form of apology for such a seeming vacation of all their tenets was
to say, e.g., of Felicianus of Musti, that he was ignorantly condemned when innocent and
absent, so in his absence, he was reinstated. This statement was made by a Donatis bishop,
Clarentius, in reply to the inquiries of Naucelio. Alypius and Augustin, who were made
aware of this defense, urged in criticism <del>Ep. lxx.</del> that the Council of Bagai was therefore
guilty in condemning Felicianus unheard, and all the more in that they afterward found
him to be innocent. Either he ought not to have been condemned if he was innocent, or if
guilty, he ought not to have been received back. If the council erred, why not apply such a
liability to error to the origin of the schism; might not Cæcilian, unheard, have been condemned
although innocent? But, as a matter of fact, Felicianus was found guilty while in
thorough and declared sympathy with Maximian, and the state was called upon to enforce
his ejection. If he was welcomed without rebaptism, why not treat the Church diffused
through the whole world with the same consideration?</p>

<pb n="665"/>
<p>It was probably in the year 402 that he addressed a general appeal to the Donatist <del>Ep.
lxxvi.</del>, not to endanger their salvation by continuance in schism. If they counted the surrender
of the sacred books so great a sin, how much more grievous a transgression ought
the refusal to obey the plain commands of these books as to unity be considered. He brings
forward the usual array of passages to demonstrate the universality of the Church, and that
any limitation of this note, can only be at the end of the world. The attempt to separate the
wheat from the tares before the harvest, is only a proof that they are of the tares. A rapid
survey of the origin of the schism follows, and all the archives are made to tell against them.
He asks how they can hold any theory of purism while they regard Optatus as a martyr and
welcome the excommunicated Maximianists? Schism in the Scriptures is punished more
severely than the burning of the books. Why complain about traditorship when Maximianists
are received? Why abuse the imperial laws directed against them, when they had invoked
the same against the Maximianists? If theirs is the only baptism, what is the baptism of
these Maximianists, which is without question validated? He challenges the Donatist bishops
to discuss these matters with their laity, if they persist in declining to meet the Catholics,
and bids the sheep beware of the wolves and their den.</p>
<p>The ad Catholicos Epistola, popularly known as de Unitate Ecclesiæ, is pretty generally
attributed to Augustin, and is addressed to the brethren of his charge; it may be taken as a
contrast to the previous letter directed to the Donatists, and not unlikely saw the light in
402 A.D. This book is designed as a continuance of the controversy with Petilian, and indeed
a further correspondence is proposed, so that the work must have appeared before that
bishop’s death, which is generally placed in this year. The chief question between the two
parties is, Where is the Church? Is it with Catholic or Donatist? The Church is one and
Catholic: it is the body of Christ, consisting of Him as its Head and those in Him as members.
The historical issue in any of four possibilities of truth or falsity does not justify separation
from this body. The point is, What does the Lord say? The Donatist should believe
in the books, which he says were delivered up, and put aside all other documents except the
divine canons. Do the Scriptures say that the Church is in Africa only, and in the few
Cutzupitanæ or Montenses at Rome, and in the house or patrimony of one woman in Spain,
or is it in the whole world? A second time does he start out with a definition of the Church,
as having for its head the Only Begotten Son, and for its body the members in Him; as
bridegroom and bride, two in one flesh. Any divergence from the Head or the body,
whether caused by difference in doctrine or government, is per se outside of the Church.
He meets the two favorite Donatistic comparisons of the divine institution with the ark and
Gideon’s fleece, and then enlarges upon the note of universality, with included unity, by
Scripture texts from the Law, the Prophets, especially Isaiah, and the Psalms. From the
Donatist position these are not fulfilled, because, say they, men are unwilling. Men were
created with free will; they believe or disbelieve according to that. When the Church began

<pb n="666"/>
to increase in the world, men refused to persevere, and the Christian religion was lost from
all the nations with the exception of the Donatists. All this, replies Augustin, as if the Spirit
of God did not know the future volitions of men. But Christ, after the resurrection, said
that the Law, the Prophets and the Psalms testified of Him, and that the fulfillment of his
kingdom should begin from Jerusalem. He then follows out the expansion of the Church
as given in the Acts, and the foundation of Christian communities as mentioned in the
Epistles and the Revelation. The Donatists reply to this theory of development that the
Church perished save among them in North Africa. It is among the few: for which they
cite a similar state of things under Enoch, Noah, Lot, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the
Kingdom of Judah. The spread of the Church did indeed begin from Jerusalem, but afterwards
an apostasy befell it, in the progress of which the communion of the Donatists alone
remained faithful. Augustin says the fact that there are evil persons in the Church is simply
a proof of the fulfillment of those parables of our Lord, which illustrate the mixed characters
in his kingdom. There is indeed a paucity of the good, but within that communion. Then
follows a discussion of the geographical limitation, the Donatists maintaining that the Oriental
churches and the rest mentioned in the sacred canon had receded from the faith. Especially
is their favorite paragraph, a passage from Cant. i. 7, commented upon. He presses
the continuous preaching among all nations, after which event the end is to come; there
must be such a universal growth to that end. Let us cease drawing from the acts and sayings
of men about this great matter, and take the simple testimony of the Scriptures. But the
Donatists object: If the Church be among you why do you compel us by force to enter its
peace? Or if we are evil why do you desire us? and if we are tares why hinder us from
growing until the harvest? Augustin then justifies the system of correction adopted in loving
care for their salvation, not failing to remind them of the Circumcelliones and their own
action with regard to the Maximianists. Another inquiry of the Donatists was, How will
you recognize us if we come to you? Augustin says, as the universally founded Church is
wont to receive, put away all hatred and your sacraments are acknowledged. This leads to
the discussion of baptism and of that related topic, the effect, of the celebrant’s character,
upon the recipient. He returns finally to the note of universality as essential to the unity,
with the one Head and the one body.</p>
<p>Somewhere about 404 A.D. two official cases of discipline had occurred in Augustin’s
monasterium, which had grieved the pride of the clergy, because they had boasted of their
establishment as really purer than the puristic body gathered about the Donatist bishop
Proculeianus. They were more troubled about this than about the sins of the suspected
brethren, one of whom, however, seemed to have considerable injustice done him. While
discussing this matter [in Ep. lxxviii.] he incidentally mentions the lapse of two Donatists,
who had been received into Augustin’s communion, and whose conduct the clergy had regarded
as a proof of the laxity of discipline under Proculeianus.</p>

<pb n="667"/>
<p>A sermon on the 95th Ps. (96) may have been preached in the year 404 or thereabouts,
in which he rebukes the Donatists for their pride in claiming either that they, the few in
Africa, are the ones bought by Christ, or that they are so great because this large gift was
bestowed on them alone. And in commenting on v. 10, dicite in nationibus, Dominus regnavit
a ligno, etc., he twits them with seeking this reign by the wood through the cudgels of the
Circumcelliones; and enlarges too upon the theme of universality, against their undiscoverable
here and there.</p>
<p>Cæcilianus, whose exact civil office, whether vicar or præfectus annonæ is yet undetermined,
Augustin addresses as præses in Ep. lxxxvi., which is ascribed to 405 A.D. The severer
edicts of Honorius had just been published. This official had carried them out with telling
earnestness. His administration in the greater part of Africa is particularly commended;
the bishop begs of him to restore the Catholic unity also in Hippo and the frontiers of Numidia.
The ill-success of his own work is not due to lack of episcopal duty, and he asks
Cæcilianus to inquire of the clergy, or of the bearer, a commissioned presbyter, about the
true state of matters; he would have the State begin with monitions in the hope of preventing
a resort to severer remedies.</p>
<p>Emeritus, the bishop of Julia Cæsarea, one of the seven Donatist disputants at the later
conference, did not shun correspondence or association with his opponents. He is described
as a man of parts and character. Augustin had written a letter to him, which is not preserved,
and it had received no reply. He once more seeks to win him to a friendly discussion or
correspondence <del>Ep. lxxxvii.</del>, in this time of general return to the mother Church. He
would have all men of culture come back to the true fellowship. What Emeritus’s particular
ground for continuing in separation may be he does not know. He proceeds to discuss
universality, purism, the validity of the documents, the heinousness of schism, the paucity
of numbers, and the right of coercion.</p>
<p>The enforcement of the civil edicts was followed by violent outbreaks of the Circumcelliones,
especially in Augustin’s diocese. The clergy united in a protest <del>Ep. lxxxviii.</del> addressed
to the venerable Bishop Januarius, a Donatist, probably in 406 A.D. They claim (1) that
they are receiving evil for good. (2) The appeal to the state was begun by the Majorinists,
and two full documents are given in proof. (3) All decrees of the empire since, are the simple
execution of the edict of Constantine against the party of Donatus which these had wanted
to be issued against Cæcilian. (4) The acts of the Circumcelliones; were the real occasion
for sharper efforts at suppression; instances of their cruelty are mentioned. (5) The Catholics
have pursued a conciliatory policy by conferences and by desiring a mitigation of the penal-
ties, which were frustrated the one by refusals, the other by a gross assault on the Catholic
bishop of Bagai; all who come into the hands of the state clergy, are treated with merciful
persuasion. (6) Various proposals for peace are suggested.</p>

<pb n="668"/>
<p>Festus, a government official and a landed proprietor apparently in Hippo, had written
a letter urging a return of the Donatists to the mother Church. It bore little fruit, and he
asks Augustin first to instruct him and also to give him a tractate for general use. Augustin,
c. 406. <del>Ep. lxxxix.</del>, enforces the duty of perseverance in the civil reclamation of the
Donatists; their claim of persecution as a note attesting them to be the true people of God
is folly, because it is not the mere suffering but the cause for which one suffers that makes
a martyr. He exhorts him to read the archives and see how the schismatics initiated the
appeal to the secular power, and how all things that have befallen them through that arm
would have been the just fate of the Cæcilianists, had the Donatist course been approved.
Besides, why this unjust treatment of the Church universal in condemning it unheard, and
rebaptizing its members, who have done them no wrong? The theory that baptism alone
is valid when administered by the just, is putting a trust in man which the Scriptures condemn;
the sacrament is not man’s but Christ’s; further, one would prefer to be baptized by
a bad man, for then he would receive grace from Christ directly, according to their subterfuge.
He is vexed with their active and passive opposition; the mother has to correct, although
her obstinate child may not like it. They aver that the Catholics accept them without requiring
any change in them, but the change required is great, no less a one than from error to
truth. The bishop proposes as a substitute for Festus’s plan, the sending of an authorized
messenger secretly to himself, and they would devise together a method for the correction
of the Donatists.</p>
<p>In the second sermon on Ps. cii. (ci.) preached about this time, when enlarging upon
the unity he ridicules the Donatist assertion that the Church which was among all the nations
had perished, as the impudent voice of those who are not in it declares. So is their affirmation
that Scripture prophecies about the spread of the kingdom have been fulfilled; all nations
have believed, but this diffused communion apostatized and perished. He rebukes the
conceit that the Lord’s saying, I am with you, even to the end of the world, was designed for
them alone, the Lord foreseeing that the party of Donatus would be in the earth. If emperors
have propounded laws against heretics, it is a part of the predictions which foretold how
kings would serve the Lord. Thence he expands the notes of universality and perpetuity.</p>
<p>Cresconius, a layman and philologist, read Augustin’s first book in answer to Petilian,
and wrote a reply, which, however, was circulated among the Donatists only. Augustin at
last secured a copy, and wrote (406 A.D., some say as late as 409) Contra Cresconium
Grammaticum Partis Donati, libri IV. Three of these books controvert the arguments of
Cresconius; part of the third and the fourth entire is a detailed polemic history of the Maximian
schism.</p>
<p>In Book I. he alludes to the occasion of the writing, and hesitates between being regarded
as contumelious if he declined an answer, and arrogant, should he reply. Cresconius had
attacked eloquence, which Augustin defends as simply the art of speaking, and as not to be

<pb n="669"/>
condemned because it has been abused. You do not condemn military armament for your
country because others have taken up arms against the country; the physician does not refuse
to use all drugs because some are baneful; because there are sophists one is not to deny the
value of eloquence. Cresconius seemed to regard its cultivation as injurious to the simplicity
of Christian law and teaching. He also had accused Augustin of persistent arrogance in his
pertinacious pursuit of the Donatists. Augustin claims to do a good work with good ends
in view, and says its fruit has been a rich harvest for the Church. So the discussion passes
on to the use of dialectics, which Cresconius assails, but Augustin defends as nothing else
than a demonstration of results, either the true from the true or the false from the false. He
justifies not disputatiousness, but the arguments by which truth is built up, for Christ employed
it, and St. Paul wielded its weapons not only with the Jews but with Epicureans and
Stoics. In all this we have an illustration of that unfortunate tendency to undervalue culture
whenever a puristic community passes into the fires. Augustin applies the art to one of the
points which Cresconius had discussed, viz., rebaptism. He had endeavored to prove that
it was solely among them. Augustin concedes that the rite is there, but not its profit; in order
to enjoy its profit, it must be administered lawfully. The oneness of baptism as a ceremony
is not dependent on the oneness of the Church, whereas its profit is. A reprobate society
of heretics can have a good baptism, but it is not properly and not profitably administered
among them; the proper and profitable administration is solely in the Church to salvation;
the rite outside is to judgment.</p>
<p>In Book II. after a résumé of the previous book, he notices first the criticism as to the
true construction of the name Donatistoe; it should rather be Donatiani as Cresconius
claimed. He is ready to concede this, and in his controversy with the philologist will use
that form, but on all other occasion he would prefer the more familiar termination.
Cresconius also protests against the term heretic as applied to them, which he regards as a
divergence of views from the Christian faith; while a schism has sprung up among those for
whom the same Christ was born, died and rose again, who have one religion, the same sacraments,
and no diversity in Christian observance. Augustin, however, while not particularly
dwelling on these agreements, presses upon him the articles of divergence, and asks why
they rebaptize? The recognition of Donatist ordination concerning which Cresconius had
asked, Augustin declares to be a matter of charity. As to the question of Cresconius, Why,
if the Donatists are such heretics and so sacrilegious, if they are indeed guilty of a nefarious
and inexpiable crime, some purification is not adopted when they come over to the Catholic
church? Augustin answers: We do not regard it as inexpiable, and baptism is not to be repeated,
it is Christ’s; on coming to us the Donatist receives the Spirit signified by that rite;
he begins to have healthfully what he previously had hurtfully and unworthily. The relation
of the celebrant to the symbol as presented by Cresconius is a modification of Petilianism.
"Regard is had," says he, "to the conscience of the giver, not according to its actuality, which

<pb n="670"/>
cannot be perceived but according to his reputation, whether that be true or false." Augustin
does not fail to crowd him for the change of base. The favorite passages of Ps. cxli. 5, Jer.
xv. 18, and Ecclus. xxxiv. 31, are gone over. Then he answers the charge made by
Cresconius, as to the right of any sinner to baptize among the Catholics. Finally, he reviews
Cyprian’s relation to rebaptism, who is not a canonical authority for him; the Scriptures
alone are such; but the Donatists ought to consider that decision of his to remain in unity
from the fact that the mixed nature of its membership requires toleration.</p>
<p>Book III. Augustin contends that the Donatists by their schism from especially the
Eastern churches had violated the principle of toleration, which their boasted leader had so
strenuously enforced. There follows then a seriatim consideration of the points made by
Cresconius, similar to those maintained by Petilian, as to the importance of the origin and
the head and root in baptism, or the character of the celebrant, and the rebaptism by Paul
of John’s disciples. The case of Optatus and the Maximianists next come under review, as
witnesses against their testimonies. Cresconius says he will neither absolve nor condemn
Optatus, and as to the Maximianists, he professes to have made special inquiry into the
whole history. The Synod had granted a season of delay during which all who returned
should be held innocent. Of this very many availed themselves; the baptism of these was
valid; those who remained outside lost both baptism and the church. Augustin refutes the
statement from its inherent contradictions and from the language of the Synod against the
Maximianists. Cresconius also brings forward the Sardican council’s letter to Donatus as
a proof of sustained fellowship. Augustin declares it to be an Arian council; and he insists
on paralleling all Cresconius would say about Cæcilianism with the career of the Maximianists.
With reference to persecution, he cites in extenso their own persecutions, the case of
Severus, bishop of Thubursicubur; the acts of Optatus; his own treatment at a collation by
the Circumcelliones; the case of Crispinus, the Donatist bishop of Calama; their own invocation
of the state against the Maximianists. Thence he returns to the doctrine of the unity
as universal with many of the familiar Scripture texts, and asserts by the documents that
the Donatists were the occasion of the rupture.</p>
<p>Book IV. is a review of Cresconius’s work by the light of the Maximianist records. Beginning
with a pleasantry as to their eloquence and dialectic spirit, he follows in detail the
points of Cresconius whether doctrinal or historical as to Cæcilian, mainly with Maximianist
data as offsets. Cresconius charges Augustin with having called Petilian Satan, and so violating
the peace he professes. Augustin claims that he only compared the error not the person,
to Satan. Nor had Cresconius forgotten to bring out the Manichæism of his opponent.
Augustin reminds him both of what he had written against them and also of what sins were
forgiven in the return of Maximian, who was an old man when Augustin was but young;
these were the sins of his youth. The theories of fellowship, of persecution, of baptism, are

<pb n="671"/>
all considered in the light of their own council of Bagai and its sequences. <del>Cp. Retractt. II.
xxvi.</del>.</p>
<p>After concluding his work against Cresconius, he issued, probably in this same year, a
little treatise he had promised, containing a collection of proofs both for Donatist and
Catholic popular use. To the pledge itself an unknown Donatist replied, which led to the
production of a second book, whose title Augustin designed to be: Contra nescio quem
Donatistam. The original promise was fulfilled in the publication of the Probationes et
Testimonia contra Donatistas, embracing all the ecclesiastical and public acts and Scripture
proofs bearing on the questions between them. It was designed mainly for public reading
in the basilicas. Both were joined in one book, although apparently afterwards separated.
In each he confesses to the error of placing the purgation of Felix after instead of before the
vindication of Cæcilian. At this writing he still regarded the Donatists as psychics and babes,
but in his old age corrects his application of the words to them, since he came to consider
them rather as dead and lost. Unfortunately neither treatise has been preserved. <del>Cp. Retractt.
II. xxvii. and xxviii.</del>.</p>
<p>He also conceived the plan of preparing a polemic for the people who had little time
for extended reading, by refuting the entire theory of the schism through the story of the
excision and restoration of the Maximianists. It appeared c. 406 A.D. under the name of
Admonitio Donatistarum de Maximianistis: this too is lost. <del>Cp. Retractt. II. xxix.</del>.</p>
<p>An acquaintance of earlier days in Carthage, Vincentius, had become bishop of the little
Rogatist fragment as the immediate successor of Rogatus himself at Cartenna. He, or some
one of that little band, had written a letter to Augustin with a pretty strong plea against
persecution. This was not unlikely in c. 408 A.D., and Augustin answers in one of his most
weighty epistles (Ep. xciii.), under the supposition that Vincentius was the author, and vindicates
the help of the State. Evidently a change had come over Numidia, for he boasts of
the multitudes who had been converted, and rejoices in the fruitful use of the secular arm
for their salvation. Even Circumcelliones had become steadfast Catholics. Coercion stimulates
the thoughtless and those bound by custom, and delivers these held back by fear; it is
like a wholesome medicine, or the wounds inflicted by a friend. God chastens in order to
better the life and to bring men to repentance. The householder instructs us to compel them
to come in. Sarah and Hagar are types; so the mother Church corrects her children.
Everything depends on the aim in persecution, whether it be done for oppression or for
good; it is the difference between Pharaoh and Moses in their treatment of Israel. The
Father gave up the Son, and the Son gave Himself up; while Judas betrayed Him. The
righteousness of the end for which one suffers alone constitutes martyrdom. The Rogatist
is not suffering for righteousness but for unrighteousness. Augustin is constrained to confess
that there are no persecutions recorded in the New Testament as inflicted by Christians,
but explains the omission as due to the fact that rulers were not yet members of the Church.

<pb n="672"/>
He thinks, too, that the moderate and discriminating form of the correction employed, helps
to justify a resort thereto. If the Rogatists have nothing to do with the violence of the Circumcelliones,
and use no force as the rest of the Donatists do, it is because they are so few
and feeble. The Donatists, however, did use the secular arm against the Maximianists, and
in the appeal to Julian. He will not allow a distinction between resort to law for the recovery
of property and for the coercion of the conscience. He claims that to regain one’s own in
this way has no apostolic warrant. The Donatists, too, sought imperial aid to coerce Cæcilianus.
Why shall not Catholics return in kind? The very edict of confiscation which had hit
them they had hoped might fall on the head of Cæcilian and his followers. What Tychonius
said describes the very essence of Donatist arbitrariness: quod volumus sanctum est. The
sin of separation from the whole world followed; the universal church was condemned unheard,
and the toleration which Cyprian urged disregarded. He traces his own change of
views from the non-coercive to the coercive policy, the success of the method in hastening
conversions won him wholly as an enthusiastic and persistent supporter. He bids Vincentius
flee from the wrath to come. What is his little handful compared with the universal
Church? This note of universality he develops in extenso against their limitation, and especially
their new definition of Catholic, as obedience to all the laws and the sacraments, and
to their childish allegory of Cant. i. 7. He hints that in the ancient times there might have
been a little schism which anticipated the Rogatists, and which had called itself exclusively
the Church. He thinks it is also the duty of the State to suppress idolatry. The passage
quoted from Hilary by Vincentius, as to the few who in Asia in his day were believers in
spite of the spread of the Church, Augustin softens into an excited picture of the dark times
of persecution. Next, he discusses the position of Cyprian. All patristic testimony, however,
is of no final value; the only authority is the Word of God. Moreover, if Cyprian be quoted,
why not on the side of his love for unity and toleration? The averment that the Church,
with the exception of the Rogatists, perished by fellowship with the unbaptized, is met with
the fact that in Cyprian’s time men had been received without rebaptism into the Church,
and therefore the Church, according to their theory, must have perished before their day;
if it, however, survived that condition, then there is no excuse left for a schism on that
ground. One is not of higher merit than Cyprian simply because he may abhor that father’s
error, any more than they who did not fall into Peter’s mistake are above him in worth on
that account. Indeed Cyprian may have rectified his fault before death; and some say that
those passages are interpolations. Augustin, however, concedes their authenticity. Cyprian,
in his Epistle to Antonianus, shows how the African bishops maintained unity in spite of
the corrupt lives of some colleagues; variations of opinion were allowed; neither were they
contaminated by such a fellowship, nor was the Church destroyed. Tychonius states the
result of a Donatist council which granted fellowship to those in their own body who had
been guilty of tradition, and that without rebaptism, in case the restored should oppose such

<pb n="673"/>
a repetition of the rite. Deuterius, bishop of Macriana, had admitted traditors to his communion
without renewing the sacrament, and many witnesses of both facts were living in
Tychonius’s own day. Parmenian had indeed replied to the arguments, but could not
gainsay the facts. Augustin professes in all sincerity his anxiety for the salvation of the
jeopardized Donatists; the Church acknowledges the Sacrament which they have administered,
and desires them to have the profit thereof. In defence of rebaptism Vincentius had
alleged the case of Paul, repeating the ceremony after John. Augustin asks was John then a
heretic? If not, it is for you to say why the ordinance was iterated; Christ’s baptism is always
the same and must not be iterated; it has nothing to do with the merit or demerit of the individual,
or else Paul would not have declined its continuous administration. He begs him
to put no confidence in the accident of their being a little company, and not to arrogate to
themselves the title of Catholic, in the sense of being keepers of the entire law and all the
sacraments, nor to peculiar sanctity as the few who were to have faith at the coming of the
Son of Man. The Church does not take pleasure in correction, save for conversion; she abhors
those who seek Donatist property out of sheer covetousness, yet all property does belong
to the true Church. She has also no delight in any who disregard Donatist discipline, by
receiving members who have been ejected from that body for sin. The Catholic Church
sustains the unity, and recognizes the mixture of chaff and wheat, good and bad fish, the
goats and the sheep. He bids him come to that Church into whose fellowship Vincentius
had described Augustin as entering. He closes with reflections on the aggravations in the
sin of schism and on the need of repentance.</p>
<p>Olympius had recently been elevated to the dignity of magister officiorum. He had
written to Augustin soliciting his advice on the best way for the civil authority to help the
Church. Augustin, c. 408 <del>Ep. xcvii.</del>, welcomes his elevation, commends his devotion to
the body of Christ, and is glad to have his own timidity relieved by this invitation to lay before
the highest official the exacting needs of the hour. These had become grave; the very success
of coercion had precipitated new commotions among the Circumcelliones and their clerical
abettors. A commission had sailed in mid-winter to solicit imperial help against their fury.
The first point he would suggest, but without having had the opportunity of consultation,
save probably with bishop Severus, is to declare by proclamation that the imperial edicts
were not the invention of Stilicho, as the Donatists and heathen boasted. As to further plans,
the episcopal commission would doubtless consult with him on their return from court.
He invites Olympius to rejoice with him on the practical benefits of coercion thus far.</p>
<p>It may have been a little later (c. 408 or 409) that Augustin writes to Donatus the proconsul
(Ep. c.) regretting indeed that the Church must avail herself of the State, but he is
gratified that so devoted a son is wielding the sword for her. The crimes against the Church
are greater than all other crimes, but in her discipline he deprecates any spirit of revenge,
and pleads most beseechingly against the infliction of capital punishment; that would be a

<pb n="674"/>
deterrent to the bringing in of any charges against the guilty. He asks for a republication
of the repressive laws, since the enemy is boasting of their repeal.</p>
<p>Augustin wrote a general letter to the Donatist people in c. 409 <del>Ep. cv.</del>, in which he
declares that the Catholic effort at their conversion is the work of peacemakers. Some
Donatist presbyters had ordered the Catholics to let their people alone, if they did not want
to be killed, but Augustin would all the rather ask the people to recede from the schismatics
because they were separated from that body for which Christ died. Catholics must seek for
the stolen sheep that had on them the mark of Christ. The charge of being traditors, says
he, we meet with a like accusation against you, and then you bid us leave. You claim to be
the Church on this unproved charge, unmindful of what law, prophecy, Psalms, Apostles
and Gospels say as to its universality beginning at Jerusalem. You are not in communion
with that universal body, and you prevent the escape of others from a similar perdition.
The objection as to persecution he meets with an invitation to look at the deeds of clergy
and Circumcelliones, and cites instances of grievous ill-treatment toward voluntary converts:
Marcus, presbyter of Casphalia, Restitutus of Victoria, Marcianus of Urga, Maximinus and
Possidius, and then protests against their general violence and robberies, and especially
against attributing martyrdom to those who had only been punished for their crimes. To
all this compulsion we oppose the State, he affirms, and many of your own people rejoice
in deliverance from your oppressions. You have filled Africa with false charges as to Cæcilian,
Felix, etc., and though we do not place our hope in man, yet we do recognize the State as
the servant of the Church. Nebuchadnezzar is an example both of the persecutor and the
correctionist. You despise the baptism of Christ; ought this not to be punished? He then
reviews the history of the case in the light of the documents; commenting on them as forms
of their own appeal to the State. The liberty of error is most deadly to the soul. Christ and
the Apostles command unity, and this command the Emperors seek to enforce. Only Julian
and the heathen emperors were persecutors; the only martyrs are those who suffer for
Catholic truth. The whole imperial legislation against Donatism is the outcome of the original
statute of Constantine and sprang after all from their appeal. He next discusses their
view of baptism and insists that the rite is independent of the character of the celebrant;
were it dependent, then, according to their notion, we should rather desire to be baptized
by a bad man, in order to receive the grace directly from Christ. The appeal to unity follows.
Make concord with us he urges; we love you and desire to serve you, even by the aid of the
temporal laws; we do not want you to perish as aliens from your Catholic mother. Your
charges you are unable to substantiate, and yet you avoid all conference with us, as if to
shun fellowship with sinners; a false pride, which is rebuked by Paul’s conduct, by the Lord’s
in his treatment of Judas; the Lord held conference even with the devil. This he follows with
extended Scriptural proofs of the universality of the Church. He reminds them again of the
unproved charges which apply rather to themselves; but he has no desire for the historical

<pb n="675"/>
argument, rather for the doctrinal. The Catholic aim is their conversion, whether by the
persuasion of argument or the correction of laws. They should remember the mixed nature
of the Church, and that mere contact with evil does not defile. If you hold to Christ, hold
also to His Church; you kill us who seek to tell you the truth, and do not want you to perish
in evil. May God vindicate us and his cause by slaying your errors and making you rejoice
with us in the truth.</p>
<p>On the death of Proculeianus, Macrobius succeeded to the see of Hippo Regius. Augustin
hears that he is about to rebaptize a subdeacon (Rusticianus) who under discipline left the
Catholics. Augustin urges him <del>Ep. cvi.</del>, c. 409, not to do this by his desire to have life in
God, and to please God by not making the sacraments vain, and by his hope of not being
separated from the body of Christ eternally. The Donatists have admitted the validity of
baptism as administered by Felicianus and Primianus, why then rebaptize others? and begs
him to search that case as a test of the whole matter.</p>
<p>Maximus and Theodore had been commissioned to deliver the previous letter to Bishop
Macrobius. He at first declined to listen to its reading, but was at last persuaded to attend,
and in reply said: It was his duty to receive all who came, and to give faith to those who
asked it. Into the question about Primian he would not enter, because of his own recent
ordination; he was not a judge of his father, and he would remain in what his predecessors
had accepted. These replies were conveyed to Augustin in the letter cvii. (c. 409) by the two
commissioners.</p>
<p>In still further hope of reaching Bishop Macrobius, Augustin addressed another epistle,
(cviii. ) c. 409, to him in answer to the objections offered by him at the interview with the
commissioners. 1. As to the point that he must receive those who come and give them the
faith they ask: Augustin proposes the case of some one who has received the rite in their
communion, but had been separated from it for a time, and having returned, conscientiously
desires to be rebaptized; Macrobius, according to his objection, could not repeat the rite,
but would proceed to instruct him. Why repeat it when Augustin administers it? May be
you will quote, "keep thyself from strange water and do not drink from a strange fountain."
How then will you explain the reception of Felicianus? 2. As to the second conclusion, that
you would remain in the faith of your predecessors: It is a pity for a young man of good
parts to say so; nothing compels you to remain in evil; you had better be in the Church
which began in Jerusalem and spread thence through the world. 3. And if you will not judge
your fathers why judge my fathers? If not Primian, why Cæcilian? Why deny us to be
brethren? why rend the body? why extinguish the baptism of Christ, who baptizes with the
Spirit, and who gave Himself for the Church? Yet your colleagues in effect do yield to the
truth in their recognition of the Maximianists. Judge not the evil but do judge what was
good in Primian. That act of his, the reception of the Maximianists, absolves the nations
who are ignorant of what you accuse us. He then traces the whole development of that

<pb n="676"/>
schism and its overthrow, to show that those schismatics were not rebaptized at their return.
That history Augustin considers a divinely appointed refutation of all the Donatist tenets.
He proceeds to criticise their Scripture proofs, Prov. ix. 18, Jer. xv. 18, Eccl. xxxiv. 30, Ps.
cxli. 5, which he turns against them through the story of the schism. He next addresses
himself to their theory of fellowship, and discusses their proof texts, I Tim. v. 22, Is. lii. 11,
I Cor. v. 6; Ezekiel, Daniel, the Apostles, Christ and Paul all rebuke this purism. Cyprian’s
authority for rebaptism is reviewed. Augustin repeats the doubts of very many as to the
authenticity of those parts of his works which favor this view; but granted that they are valid,
Cyprian, nevertheless, maintained unity and toleration, and by martyrdom purged his
mistake. There is, however, no martyrdom outside of the unity, as that father also testified.
Cyprian acknowledged as well the presence of many evil persons in the ministry and in the
Church, but stood to it that unity must not be sacrificed on that account. The Church is a
mixed society; this is Christ’s law. Had Macrobius’s associates remembered the parable of
the wheat and tares they would not have separated. This argument is concluded with a sort
of summary of the points traversed before. As to the note of persecution: that alone is a
martyrdom which surrenders the life for a good cause. The Donatists too used the State in
the case of the Maximianists, and to them belong the Circumcelliones. The matter of unity
and the connected points of toleration and fellowship are again enlarged upon.</p>
<p>A sermon attributed to Augustin, De Rusticiano subdiacono a Donatistis rebaptizato et
in diaconum ordinato, falls in the same year, 409, with the letter to Bishop Macrobius. There
is an outburst of deep grief over the act. It would appear that Rusticianus had been a special
favorite of Augustin, on whom he had expended much care; but he had become involved
in scurrilous deeds, in feasting and intemperance, day and night, and was plunged in debt,
and at last was excommunicated by his presbyter, and so fled to the Donatists, by whom he
was rebaptized and made a deacon; this defection happened in the diocese of the bishop
Valerius (?); so Augustin interposed through Maximius and Theodorus with Bishop Macrobius,
but in vain. He deplores the disgrace done to the sacrament, as dishonor done to
the sign of the King. The repetition is contradicted by the procedure with regard to the returning
Maximianists. He corrects the misinterpretation of Ecclus. xxxiv. 30. He wishes
for the Donatists the experience of the prodigal, that they may be forgiven by return to the
Church and so attain to the profit of charity.</p>
<p>Great calamities were befalling the Church in all parts of the world. Victorianus, a
presbyter, wrote to Augustin for relief from doubts as to the office of such afflictions; in the
bishop’s reply, <del>Ep. cxi.</del> possibly of Nov., 409, he mentions the cruelties of the Donatists at
Hippo exceeding those of the Barbarians, especially in the resort to acidified lime, clubbing,
robberies, and other destructive measures to compel rebaptism; forty-eight in one place
were thus forced to a repetition. The coercion policy, in other words, had stimulated some
of the Donatists to retaliation.</p>

<pb n="677"/>
<p>Donatus had resigned his proconsulship. Augustin writes <del>Ep. cxii.</del> at the end of 409
or beginning of 410 A.D., to express his regrets at not meeting him on his visit to Tibilis;
his retirement would now give leisure for a larger development in graces, and would lead
him to esteem the superiority of eternal things. He praises him for his official worth, which
indeed was in everybody’s mouth, but he urges him not to defer to that popularity, but to
seek the higher approbation. After reminding him of the duty of Christian progress, he asks
for a reply and an exhortation to be addressed to all his dependents at Sinitis and Hippo to
return to the Church. Greetings are sent to his father, whom the son had been instrumental
in converting to the faith.</p>
<p>Petilian of Constantina had written a treatise, de unico baptismo, which Constantinus
had come into possession of through some Donatist presbyter, and then gave it to Augustin
while they were in the country, imploring him to answer it. He did so, c. 410, in the book
bearing the same title. He scorns those who desire secrecy in such matters; when the deeds
are public let the discussion be. Petilian claims that the only true baptism is theirs: and
therefore it is not repeated by the sacrilegious theorists. Yes, replies Augustin, baptism is
indeed one, but it is Christ’s, not yours; yours is only a repetition of the rite. We correct
what is yours and recognize what is Christ’s. Therefore we do not repeat it. So Christ corrected
what was evil and recognized what was good among the Jews. So Paul exposed the
sin of the heathen world but acknowledged what truth it had. Moreover you perform the
ceremony, but it is to destruction: there is no real advantage in baptism outside of the
Church. Petilian pleads for rebaptism because Paul rebaptized John’s disciples; but, says
Augustin, that is to declare John a heretic. These are two different things, as indeed Petilian
himself suggests, some might say, and then gives two irrelevant passages, Matt. xii. 30, and
vii. 21–23, as if the Catholics had no fellowship with Christ and were not recognized by
Him. Augustin, after considering the import of these passages, avers the readiness of the
Church to recognize the baptism of Christ as administered by Donatists when they return
to the Church; for to deny Christ’s baptism because it is administered by heretics, is to say
Christ Himself should be denied, when even demons confess Him. There is a belief in God
outside of the Church; the devils believe in Him outside of the Church. So there is one
baptism of Christ which may exist also outside of the Church. Petilian’s declaration that
true baptism is where the true faith is, Augustin disproves by citing the case of the unbelieving
and schismatic, yet baptized Corinthians. So all the ages of the kingdom bear witness to a
like state of things. The action of Agrippinus and Cyprian on the one side, and of Stephen
on the other, as to rebaptism is reviewed; differing in this, they yet maintained unity, especially
Cyprian. Further, if the contact of evil men within the fellowship really defiles the
good, then the Church perished in Cyprian’s time; where could Donatus then have been
spiritually born? If there is no such pollution, then there is no occasion to rage for separation.
The origin of the schism is then denied from documentary testimony, and the charges de-

<pb n="678"/>
clared to be not sustained; on the other hand, these archives prove the schismatics to have
been traditors. A summary of the main points concludes his plea for the sole baptism as
that of Christ. <del>Cp. Retractt. II. xxxiv.</del>.</p>
<p>After this book against Petilian just mentioned had been finished, he wrote another
work of larger proportions and with more thoroughness, in refutation of their schism, by
the data of the Maximian schism, which he considered a full surrender of all their particularism.
This has been styled: De Maximianistis contra Donatistas. It is lost, but noticed in
the Retractations (II. xxxv.) immediately after de unico Baptismo.</p>
<p>At Carthage, about May 15, 411, he preached in praise of peace (Sermo ccclvii.). After
its eulogy, he summons his hearers to the love of that peace; and recalls Donatists as alienated
from the unity unto the concord which exists in the Church only. Patience and prayer are
better means to their conquest than reproof. After the pentecostal fast he bade them exercise
hospitality toward the guests who should attend the Conference.</p>
<p>The two edicts concerning the great Conference had been issued by Marcellinus. The
Donatists had sent in their protest to the second, while the Catholic bishops sent in their
acquiescence in a letter <del>Ep. cxxviii.</del>, which is ascribed to Augustin’s hand. It was of course
written before June 1, 411, the day appointed for the opening. They agree to all the provisions
for maintaining an orderly discussion; to the time and place of meeting; to the numbers to
be present; to the requirement that all the delegated disputants sign their deliverances; to
the countersignatures; to the order prohibiting the people from access to the Conference.
If the Donatists prove the Church universal to have been lost and to be solely with them,
the Catholic bishops will resign their sees; if, however, the collation prove the universality
of the Church, then they suggest the recognition of the ordination and office of the Donatist
clergy, and propose details for the succession in case of any jointure. The conciliatory example
of Christ persuades them to this step; the peace of Christ in the Church is higher than
the episcopate. The Donatist use of the civil authority against the Maximianists, and their
gladness in receiving the returning schismatics without rebaptism, and without any diminution
of their honors, give hope of a return to the root.</p>
<p>Before the meeting of the Conference, Augustin preached a sermon (No. ccclviii.) in
Carthage, on peace and love, of which the main thoughts were the peace to which the
Catholics cling and which they love under the persuasion of the divine testimonies; the
victory of truth is love. He presents the Scripture proofs of charity and universality; the inheritance
should not be divided. Donatus and Cæcilian were but men, but baptism is Christ’s
and not man’s. The charity spread abroad in the heart is a broad commandment. He invites
the Donatists to share in the Church’s possessions, and to be bishops along with the Catholics,
and pleads for a joint fraternal recognition; the Catholics seek peace and want to build up
the Church. He finally requests the people to keep aloof from the place of dispute, but invokes
their prayers in its behalf.</p>

<pb n="679"/>
<p>The objection to the second edict on the part of the Donatists respecting the restriction
upon the number to be present at the collation, led the Catholics to write a second letter to
Marcellinus, which is most likely also from the pen of Augustin. <del>Ep. cxxix.</del>. Solicitude
over the opposition is expressed; some seem disposed to present a hindrance to the peaceful
progress of the Conference; and yet the writers hope that the thought and suspicion may
not prove true, but that the desire of the whole body may after all be to press into the unity
of the Catholic Church. Then they go on, very wrongfully in such a document, to discuss
their favorite note of the universality of the Church, as the body of Christ was not stolen,
so neither are His members outside of the few in Africa, dead. From Jerusalem outward
was to be its progress and thence it filled the whole world. The fact that the Donatists have
the very same Scriptures as the Catholics which contain these proofs of universality, fills
the complainants with grief for them. The Jews who denied the resurrection rejected also
the New Testament; but the Donatists receive it, and yet they deny the note of universality,
and accuse the Catholics of being traditors of the sacred books. Now at the collation probably
they wish to be in full numbers, in order to search completely the Scriptures; and through
their innumerable testimonies they long to come en masse, not to create a tumult, but to
put an end to the old discord. It is true that they have found fault with our use of the State;
and yet the Scriptures vindicate such a recourse, and the Donatists themselves appealed to
Constantine. The Scriptures too show the mixed character of the Church, wheat and chaff,
good and bad fish, to the final harvest, the winnowing, and the further shore. Perhaps they
see the wrong of their opposition to the Church. The case of the Maximianists has shown
their willingness to use the power of the State and to ignore rebaptism; and probably moved
by these things, they want to come in such large numbers in the interest not of tumult but
of peace. They desire to show that they are not so few as their enemies report them to be.
The Catholic numbers exceed in proconsular Africa, and, except in Numidia, are more numerous
than in the rest of the African provinces; and most of all when one comes to compare
the whole world with the few Donatists. Why, however, could not the number be just as
well certified by the subscription? Even though quiet be preserved, yet at such a Conference
the murmur of such a crowd will impede the progress of the work. If they all are allowed
to be present, the writers, nevertheless, will limit themselves to the delegation suggested by
the Judge, and then no blame for disorder can attach to them. If, however, the protest has
been made in behalf of unity, they all will be present joyfully to welcome the Donatists as
brethren.</p>
<p>The Mandatum Catholicorum, a sort of voucher and letter of instruction for the disputants
on the side of the State Church, was undoubtedly the product of Augustin’s pen.
After a preamble which attests the sufficiency of the Church through her divine proofs
against all heretics and schismatics, and the desire of Church and State to settle the long
pending controversy in Africa, and the duty to enlighten men as to the eternal salvation,

<pb n="680"/>
which things had induced them to convene and to select defenders, there follows the note
of the universality, which, as the great proposition, is expanded with many proof texts from
the Old and the New Testament. This truth is to be defended against the Donatist assertion
that the universal Church had perished through contamination with Cæcilian; for the Church
is a mixed society of good and evil, and not to be condemned on this account, but its unity
is to be preserved by toleration. If they maintain this view, the documents concerning Cæcilian’s
character must be examined. The contestants must prove that the Church was thus
defiled, or else the evil do not defile the good in this unity. The mandate then gives Scriptural
and also post-apostolic proofs on this point, especially from Cyprian, and quotes the
Donatist action concerning the Maximianists. The next topic is baptism as a sacrament of
Christ and not of man, and as independent of the character of the celebrant: the Maximian
schism again affords material for the confutation of this Donatistic tenet. They are instructed
also to use the archives to show that their opponents initiated civil appellation.</p>
<p>In the session of the second day, Augustin is the speaker, mainly on the matter of delay
and adjournment.</p>
<p>In the third session, he appears as the chief disputant on the doctrinal and historical
points, and also as answering the letter of the Donatists in reply to the mandate.</p>
<p>In a sermon preached after the close of the Conference, (Sermo ccclix. on Ecclus. xxv.</p>
<p>2), he exhorted all Christians to be brethren; the Catholics desire to have the Donatists unite
with them in worship in the universal Church. The history of Cæcilian should not affect
the doctrine of the body. He claims a triumph indeed for his side and rejoices over the many
who are returning to the mother Church, but candidly confesses that many harden themselves
in their opposition. His exordium appeals for a restoration of brotherly harmony.</p>
<p>A little later in the year, probably, Augustin preached from Gal. vi. 2–5 (Sermo clxiv.),
in which he rebukes those who say: "We are saints, we do not carry your burdens, therefore
we do not communicate with you;"and says: "your ancestors carry burdens of separation,
burdens of schism, burdens of heresy, burdens of dissension, burdens of animosity, burdens
of false proofs, burdens of calumnious accusations." In your boast of non-participation in
other’s sins, you desert the flock, the threshing-floor and the net. The traditors who had
condemned the absent Cæcilian dissolved connection with the whole world. He reminds
them of the Maximianists; he charges them with breaking the parables, and yet inculcates
patience. The whole sermon indicates that the effect of the conference had been to embitter
both sides.</p>
<p>Another sermon (xcix.) on Luke vii. 36, 50, was also preached about this time, in which
he conceives that the Puristic noli me tangere may develop into a system for sin-pardoning,
and justification and sanctification; the men of the Gesta Collationis are likely to bring about
such a machine religion. Already do they say: if men do not remit sins, then what Christ
says is false as to loosing on earth and in heaven. With this conception of the tendency of

<pb n="681"/>
their tenets he further says against them, that the cleansing in baptism does not depend on
the man.</p>
<p>In a fragment of another sermon (ccclx.), preached on the vigils of Maximian, he personates
a Donatist, who has returned to the unity, thanking the Lord that the lost is found,
and expressing his joy in the vine, the unity, the baptism and peace of Christ.</p>
<p>The authorized acts of the council of 411 were too unwieldy for either general or popular
use, and a compendium framed from them was too obscure; so Augustin, about the close
of 411, determined to make a digest, called the Breviculus collationis cum Donatistis. It gives
the collations of the three days, but it is thoroughly disconnected without the official account,
for too many links known to the actors alone are not apparent to the uninitiated; too much
of what would throw light on the animus of the parties in power is passed over, and a considerable
deal of the minor business necessary to the understanding of the spirit of the debate
does not appear. A reader would certainly get a still more one-sided and intolerant idea of
the Conference from the digest than from the Gesta. The analysis of the order of business
would require a comparison with the Gesta Collationis, and that lies outside of our present
purpose. <del>Cp. Retractt. II. xxxix.</del>.</p>
<p>The decision of the Conference again stirred up a counter movement by the Circumcelliones,
especially in Augustin’s diocese, during which some terrible outrages were perpetrated;
the presbyter Restitutus was killed; the presbyter Innocentius was clubbed and mutilated.
A trial was instituted by Marcellinus and the crimes confessed. Augustin hastens to write
to him <del>Ep. cxxxiii.</del>, somewhere about the opening of 412 A.D., imploring that the punishment
be not capital or retaliatory; restraint and labor would be just. He commends the
tribune-notary’s moderation in the examination, in that he did not resort to torture for extorting
evidence, but only to whipping. He commands him, as bishop, not to proceed to
extremity, which would be an injury to the Church, or at least to the diocese of Hippo. Since
the pronouncing of the sentence presumably belonged to the proconsul, he had also indicted
a letter to him.</p>
<p>Apringius, the proconsul, was a brother of Marcellinus. To him Augustin addressed a
letter in the same interest, and at the same date. [Ep. cxxxiv.] For the use of his newly gained
authority, he was accountable to God; he was also a Christian, so that Augustin felt a greater
confidence in petitioning and in warning, and begs that he may regard his interference as
a part of a bishop’s zeal for the welfare of the Church. He repeats the story of the arrest of
the Circumcelliones and Donatist clergy, the trial by Apringius’s own brother, the tribunenotary,
Marcellinus, and the gentleness of the hearing, in which the accused confessed their
crime, especially as to the copresbyters. He now begs for a mild punishment; in the one
case it cannot be strictly retaliatory; in that of the homicide he fears it may be capital punishment.
Apringius must not only consider the State, but the Church, and respect her
clemency. He is not only a ruler of exalted power but a son of Christian piety. Our enemies

<pb n="682"/>
boast of persecution; we must give them no occasion for it. These acts should be read for
the cure of the minds which have been perverted. If the extreme penalty has to fall, spare
at least the children. He implores him to imitate the patience and mildness of the Church
and of Christ.</p>
<p>Augustin, in 412, writes to Marcellinus <del>Ep. cxxxix.</del> expressing his delight that the
proceedings connected with the trial are in preparation, and for the intention of having
them read in the churches of the city, and, if possible, in all the churches of his diocese. The
crimes mentioned are the same as before, with added confessions of many who were in
some degree abettors. These are the men who refuse to commune with the Catholic Church
for fear of pollution from wicked men, and yet refuse to leave a schism debased by such a
fellowship. It was a question in Marcellinus’s mind whether the Gesta should be read in the
Donatist church of Theoprepia in Carthage. Augustin urges it, and if it be too small then
in some other quarter, in that region of the city. Augustin pleads for a mild punishment in
imitation of the clemency of the Church; however weak it may seem at the outset, men will
afterward regard it with favor, and the reading of the Gesta will be more welcome and more
effective by the contrast between Donatist cruelty and Catholic moderation. He speaks of
the commission of the bishop Bonifacius and the bearer Peregrinus, who were empowered
to treat upon some new measures for the benefit of the Church. The Donatist Bishop
Macrobius was busy reopening the churches of his sect, followed by a band of both sexes.
In the absence of Celer, a Donatist, his procurator, Spondeus, a Catholic, had broken their
audacity. He is commended to the favorable notice of Marcellinus. While Spondeus was
on a visit to Carthage, Macrobius had actually reopened the Donatist churches on the estates
of Celer. He was assisted by Donatus, a rebaptized deacon and a leader in the slaughter;
from which fact other outrages might be expected. Should the plea for mildness not be
granted, Augustin asks that his letters urging clemency [Epp. cxxxiii. and cxxxiv.] be read
along with the Gesta. At least let a remission be granted to give time for an appeal to the
Emperors, for no martyrs desire their blood to be avenged by death. In apologizing for his
inability to complete his work on the baptism of infants, he urges the variety of his labors;
among other things he had completed the Breviculus Collationis, as a compend for those
who had not the leisure to read the entire proceedings of the Conference; also a letter addressed
to the Donatist laity.</p>
<p>The Donatists were charged with circulating the story of the bribery of the cognitor or
judge of the Conference. The letter from the council of Zerta, June 14, 412, in refutation of
this was written by Augustin, [Ep. cxli.] in which it is said that they had become acquainted
with this rumor so easily credited by the common people. The vote of the council was to
authorize a refutation of it as a falsehood. The Donatists had been convicted of mendacity
in the charge which they had made and signed against the Catholics as traditors; they had
also invented stories to account for the signature of an absent bishop. How can they be be-

<pb n="683"/>
lieved in such a charge against the cognitor? Since the acts of the Collation are so voluminous
we present herewith a digest. The meeting, the election of disputants and scribes, the matter
of the subscriptions, are then recapitulated. In the attempt at discussion, the whole aim of
the Donatist disputants was to avoid coming to the point to be debated, while the Catholic
representatives exerted themselves to reach just that goal and nothing else. When at last
the Donatists were forced to the issue, they were vanquished by the clear testimony of the
Scriptures to the universality of the Church. Any one separated from this unity has not life;
the wrath of God abides upon him. The communion with the wicked does not defile any
one by the mere participation in the sacraments, but only by agreement with their deeds.
All these truths they had to acknowledge. The Catholics had prevented a confusion between
the doctrinal and historical sides of the question. In the discussion of the documents, the
chief offset to all the points was found in the case of the Maximianists, although the
Donatists plead that a case should not be prejudged by a case, nor a person by a person. All
the accusations which had been concentrated against Cæcilian they were unable to meet
with proofs. Defeated men are wont to suggest such a defense as the corruption of the judge.
Then says the paper in effect: If you will believe us, let us hold fast to the unity which God
commands and loves. But if you are unwilling to believe us, read the proceedings themselves,
or allow them to be read to you, and do you yourselves test whether what we have written
to you be true. If you decline all these, and will still cleave to the Donatists, we are clear
from your judgment. If you will renounce the schism, we will welcome you to the peace of
Christ, and you will have the profit of that sacrament which was administered among you
to judgment.</p>
<p>The Donatist presbyters Saturninus and Eufrates had joined the Catholic Church and
maintained their rank. Augustin writes [Ep. cxlii.], c. 412 A.D., to express his joy at their
arrival and bids them not to grieve at his absence, for they are now in the one Church whose
note of universality he expands as the one Body of the one Head, and as the one house in
all the earth; in the unity of this house we rejoice as embracive of those transmarine churches,
to whom the appeal had vainly been made by the Donatists. He who lives evilly in this
Church eats and drinks condemnation to himself, but whoever lives correctly, another case
and another person cannot prejudge him. The Donatists had protested against the parallel
proofs drawn from the Maximianists, on the ground that a case should not be prejudged
by a case nor a person by a person. On the Lord’s threshing-floor the chaff must be tolerated.
He exhorts them to a faithful discharge of their clerical duties, especially in mercifulness
and also in prayer for the removal of the schism.</p>
<p>The hostility of the Donatists was increased by the Collation. Their clergy charged the
judge with bribery, and protested against the unfairness of the trial, the compulsion of the
meeting, the unjust decision. Augustin felt compelled to write, c. 412 A.D., to the people
in order to stay the fury of their leaders. The treatise is known as Ad Donatistas post Col-

<pb n="684"/>
lationem. Why make such a charge? Why does Primian say, it is unworthy for the sons of
the martyrs to meet in the same place with the offspring of traditors? Why did they come?
Why were they unable to prove the old accusations? And how are they the sons of martyrs?
The universality of the Church was demonstrated at the Conference. Donatists do not
commune with the churches addressed in those epistles which they read at their services,
because they say these perished by communion with the African Cæcilians, and yet they
put in the plea that a case should not be prejudged by a case nor a person by a person. He
meets the Cæcilian charge by the Maximianists in spite of this caveat. He represents all the
New Testament churches and the East as expostulating on the basis of this very plea with
the Donatists for separation from them. So the case and the person of the bad does not
prejudice the case and the person of the good; they must abide together until the end. He
condemns their arrogant pretense to holiness. The wicked must be tolerated in the Church,
but their deeds are not to be participated in. Cyprian would not destroy the unity because
bad people were in it; frequent are the examples of such forbearance in the Scriptures, and
the principle was not changed after the resurrection of Christ; it continued in force in the
New Testament Church; the winnowing and severance come at the end of the world. They
would perhaps deny their own words as uttered in the Conference were they not written;
that was the beauty of requiring subscription. They charge too that the sentence against
them was pronounced in the night. Augustin playfully speaks of many good things which
have been said and done in the night. He subsequently reminds them of the days in which
they tried to prove the origin of heresy, and their defeat at every point of the Cæcilian history.
It appears here again that the Donatists had a considerable body of acts of their own. The
plea of persecution as a note of the Church and as an experience of the Donatists was one
of the points urged at the conference in the Donatist reply to the Catholic mandate, and by
Primian, to which we have the usual answer. Another complaint of the Donatists was that
they were tried by those who had been condemned by themselves, and were compelled to
unite with sinners; to which Augustin gives a little Maximianist parallel and then considers
the questions of purism, the paucity of believers, the need of discipline, the fellowship of a
mixed community which ought not to degenerate into a participation in the deeds of the
wicked therein. These are discussed with considerable detail of quotations from the Old
and New Testaments. Some who thought Cæcilian guilty would not break the unity; they
imitated Cyprian. He charges their clergy with duplicity. He reminds them of the deception
practiced in presenting the signature of a Donatist, who was already dead; so with regard
to the show of numbers in attendance and the alleged multitude absent, and also the means
adopted for securing delay, the interruptions and turnings of the debate from the true object
in view. He vindicates the cognitor’s method and rulings. He then renews the discussion
concerning the archival origin of the schism. In conclusion he addresses them as brethren
and exhorts them to love peace and unity.</p>

<pb n="685"/>
<p>The Donatists of Cirta, clergy and people, had returned to the Catholic Church and had
written a letter of thanks to Augustin for his preaching, under which they had been persuaded
to renounce the schism. Augustin in reply [Ep. cxliv.], probably at end of 412 A.D., says
that this is not man’s work, but God’s. Their allusion to the conversion of the drunken and
luxurious Polemo by Xenocrates, draws from him the reflection, that such a change of
character, though not a Christian repentance, is, nevertheless, a work of God. So he bids
them not to give thanks to himself but to God, for their return to the unity. Those who still
are alienated, whether from love or fear, he charges to remember the undeceived scrutiny
of God; to weigh Scripture testimony as to the universality of the Church; and the documents
as to the origin of the schism. The case has been tried or not been tried by the transmarine
churches; if not, then there is no existing ground for the separation; if it has, the defeated
ones are the separatists. But alas! the obstacles to their persuasion are well-nigh insuperable.
He hopes that the mutual desire for his visit to them may be fulfilled.</p>
<p>About the beginning of the year 413, appeared the book De Fide et Operibus. In Chap.
iv. 6, he speaks of the need of coercion against the Donatists as disturbers of the peace of
the Church, as separaters of the tares from the wheat before the time, as those who have
blindly preferred to cut themselves off from the unity; commixture of evil and good is a
necessity, and we ought to remain in that fellowship which is not at all destitute of discipline.
<del>Cp. Retractt. II. xxxviii.</del></p>
<p>Donatus, a Donatist presbyter, and another person connected with that body, had been
arrested by order of Augustin about the beginning of 416 A.D. Mounted upon a beast
against his will, he dashed himself to the ground and so received injuries which his less obstinate
companion escaped. Augustin writes <del>Ep. clxxiii.</del> to vindicate himself as concerned
about the salvation of the recusants, and puts the blame of the wounds upon the offender.
Donatus urged in opposition to this style of conversion that no one should be compelled to
be good. Augustin claims on the other hand that many are compelled to take the good office
of a bishop against their will. Donatus argues that God had given us free will, therefore a
man should not be compelled even to be good. Augustin replies that the effort of a good
will is to restrain and change the evil will, because of the awful results which follow a vitiated
will. Why were the Israelites compelled to go to the land of promise? Why was Paul forced
to turn from persecution to the embrace of the truth? Why do parents correct children?
Why are negligent shepherds blamed? You are an errant sheep, with the Lord’s mark upon
you, and I as shepherd must save you from perishing. Of your own will you threw yourself
into a well, but it would have been wicked to leave you there where you had cast yourself
according to your will, and hence the attendants took you out; how much more is it a duty
to save you from eternal death. Besides, it is unlawful to inflict death upon yourself. He
reminds him that the Scriptures do not allow suicide; and controverts his use of I. Cor. xiii.
3, "though I give my body to be burned." Severed from charity and unity, nothing can profit,

<pb n="686"/>
not even the surrender of the body to burning. The points of the recent joint Conference
are then dwelt upon. Donatus was understood to have criticized the saying of his party as
to the Maximianist parallel: do not prejudge a case by a case or a person by a person. Augustin
twits him in this wise: If you object to this, then you are deceived concerning it, because
you oppose your authority to theirs, and if you say it is not true, the hope of vindicating
the great schism falls through entirely. He presses him to weigh all the proceedings. But
Donatus objects also that the Lord did not cause the seventy to come back, and did not put
a barrier in the way of the twelve when he asked, "Will ye also go away?" Augustin says that
was in the beginning of Christianity; kings were not yet converted; now the State helps the
Church. Our Lord said prophetically, Compel them to come in. So we hunt you in the
hedges; the unwilling sheep is brought to the true pasture.</p>
<p>The series of Tractatus on the Gospel of John, which are ascribed to 416 A.D., contain
many reflections on Donatism. We can only notice the passages:</p>
<p>Tractatus IV. in Jo. i. 19–33.</p>
<p>Tractatus V. in Jo. i. 33.</p>
<p>Tractatus VI. in Jo. i. 32, 33. Quite fully.</p>
<p>Tractatus IX. in Jo. ii. 1–11.</p>
<p>Tractatus X. in Jo. ii. 12–21.</p>
<p>Tractatus XI. in Jo. ii. 23–25, and iii. 1–5.</p>
<p>Tractatus XII. in Jo. iii. 6–21.</p>
<p>Tractatus XIII. in Jo. iii. 22–29.</p>
<p>To the same year are ascribed the Tractatus on the I. Ep. of John.</p>
<p>Tractatus I. 1 Jo. i. and ii. 1–11.</p>
<p>Tractatus II. 1 Jo. ii. 12–17.</p>
<p>Tractatus III. 1 Jo. ii. 18–27.</p>
<p>Tractatus IV. 1 Jo. iii. 1–8.</p>
<p>In the Retractations, II. xlvi., we read of a book addressed to Emeritus, the Donatist
bishop of Cæsarea, in the province of Mauritania Cæsariensis. <del>See Ep. lxxxvii.</del> He speaks
of him as the best of the seven Donatist disputants at the Conference. The work marked
briefly the lines on which the Donatists were defeated. Its title is: Ad Emeritum
Donatistarum Episcopum, post collationem, liber unus. Since the Retractations place it before
De Gestis Pelagii, and De Correctione Donatistarum, it was most likely written in the beginning
of 417 A.D.</p>
<p>Boniface had requested from Augustin a letter of instructions on the relation of the
Donatists to the Arians. The bishop replies, c. 417 <del>Ep. clxxxv.</del>, which he himself calls a
book de Correctione Donatistarum. <del>Cp. Retractt. II. xlviii.</del>. Since this is translated in the
present volume, we will omit any further notice.</p>

<pb n="687"/>
<p>The above-mentioned Emeritus was present at a Synod of the Catholics, near Deuterius,
September 20, 418. At a service held two days after, Augustin preached the Sermo ad
Cæsariensis Ecclesiæ plebem. Emeritus was present. In the church during a previous colloquy
with Augustin he had said: I cannot will what you will, but I can will what I will. Augustin
in this sermon (and the writing has all the abruptness and repetition of an extempore address)
urges him to will what God wills, viz., peace, and that now, in response to the cry of the
people; and if you ask why I, who call you schismatics and heretics, desire to receive you, it
is because you are brethren; because you have the baptism of Christ; because I want you to
have salvation: one can have everything outside the Church except salvation; he can have
honor, he can have the sacraments, he can sing Allelulia, he can respond Amen, he can hold
to the gospels, he can have faith in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
and can preach. Persecution after all is rather of you. The failure of the archival evidence
as to Cæcilian is alleged as usual, and hence no reason for separation exists. He recites too
the story of the seizure, escape, reseizure, compulsory baptism and ordination of Petilian,
while at the time a Catholic catechumen. This occurred at Constantina, when that city and
region were largely Donatist. He was seized unto death, do we not draw him to salvation?
Here or nowhere, says Augustin, repeating the voice of the people, is the place for peace.</p>
<p>There was a gathering of clergy (the bishops Alypius, Augustinus, Possidius, Rusticus
Palladius, etc., many presbyters and deacons and a considerable number of people) in the
exedra of the larger church at Cæsarea, c. 418 A.D. Emeritus, the Donatist bishop of the
city, was also present. Augustin addresses those devoted to the unity, and says that when
he came to the city on the day before yesterday he found Emeritus returned from a journey.
Augustin met him in the street and invited him to the Church, and Emeritus consented
without any demur. The sermon of Augustin is full of the peace, love and related themes
of the Church, in hope of winning Emeritus. He alludes to the many conversions in the city
and since the collation; if Emeritus has anything new to say in defense of his side, he invites
him to state it. Emeritus had been reported as affirming that at the Conference the Donatists
were overcome by power rather than by truth. Augustin then addresses inquiries to Emeritus
directly: as to why he had come if he was defeated at the council; or if he thought his
party had triumphed, then to state the ground for such an opinion. Emeritus said: The acts
show whether I am defeated or not, whether I am defeated by truth or oppressed by power.
Augustin: Then why do you come? Emeritus: That I might say this very thing which you
ask, and so on. Under some taunting and arrogant observations to the brethren, Emeritus
keeps quiet. From Augustin’s statement it appears that the Acts were read during Lent, at
Thagaste, Constantina, Hippo, and all the faithful churches. Part of these Gesta are then
read by Alypius, viz, the imperial convocation of the Conference, and comments are made
by Augustin. Then follows his application of the lessons afforded by the Maximianist schism,
in which he says the Donatists make shipwreck of all their tenets. Emeritus, however, re-

<pb n="688"/>
mained a silent hearer. The account of the above meeting is given in the treatise: De Gestis
cum Emerito, Cæsariensi Donatistarum Episcopo liber unus. <del>Cp. Retractt. II. li.</del>
The book de Patientia is assigned to 418 A.D. In Chapter xiii. he contrasts genuine and
false martyrdom.</p>
<p>Dulcitius had been appointed Tribune-notary. The effect of his carrying out of the renewed
edicts against the Donatists was signalized by many conversions, but also by many
suicides. He had written to Augustin requesting directions about how he ought to proceed
against the heretics. Augustin replies <del>Ep. cciv.</del>, c. 420 A.D., that his work had indeed persuaded
many to return to their salvation, but others were stirred either to kill the Catholics
or themselves. We indeed do desire the return of all to unity, yet some are doubtless predestinated
to perish by an occult yet just decree of God. They perish not only in their own fires
but in that of Gehenna. The Church grieves over them as David over his son, although they
have met the deserved punishment of rebels. Augustin does not find fault with the notary’s
edict at Thamugada, only with the phrase: You may know that you are to be given over to
the death which you deserve; for that is not contained in the rescripts. In the second edict
there is a clearer statement of the notary’s aim. Augustin also criticizes his courtesy toward
Gaudentius, the Donatist bishop of Thamugada. As to a special reply to that bishop Augustin
urges a more diligent refutation of the fallacious doctrines by which the Donatists are accustomed
to be seduced. He had already done this in very many works, but adds some points
by way of suggestion. He alone is a martyr who dies for a true cause. Man’s will is free, but
nevertheless amenable to divine and human laws. The State can punish not only adulteries
and homicides, but also sacrileges. Many think it strange that we do not rebaptize, but the
sacrament once given ought not to be repeated. Suicides are utterly prohibited by the
Scriptures. The case of Razius gives the Donatist no pretext, for the deed is simply mentioned
but not commended. (II. Mac. xiv. 37–46). In conclusion he intimates that in answer to
the united wish of the people of Thamugada, of himself and of Eleusinus, the tribune of that
place, that Augustin should answer both epistles of Gaudentius, the Donatist bishop, and
especially the latter of the two, which contained Scriptural proofs, he will write such a criticism.</p>
<p>Dulcitius had written a pacific letter to Gaudentius, the Donatist bishop of Thamugada,
one of the quieter members of the seven Donatist disputants, concerning the enforcement
of the imperial edicts. Gaudentius replied in two epistles, one short, the other longer and
fortified by Scripture proofs. Augustin was requested to answer these, which he does (c.
420) in the work Contra Gaudentium Donatistarum Episcopum, Libra duo. In Book I. he
makes a change of form from the Petilian cast of personal dialogue, because of the captious
fault found with that way as savoring of untruth, and takes a duller formula, "Verba Epistolæ"
and "ad hæc responsio," whose dryness and literality the most sensitive Donatist could take
no exception to. In the first epistle of Gaudentius, the fairly courteous strain in which he

<pb n="689"/>
had replied to the tribune-notary, with titles and recognition of character, Augustin rather
resents by saying that the Catholic had treated the heretic too kindly and incautiously, and
bids Gaudentius consider what he had said at the Collation. Gaudentius proposes to remain
in the communion where the name of God and of his Christ is and where the Sacraments
are, and pleads for religious liberty against compulsion as to matters of faith; and concludes,
by another hand, with wishing him well and desiring his recession from the disquieting of
Christians. Augustin objects that Gaudentius had not reproduced the language of Dulcitius
correctly, and accuses the Donatists of holding the truth of baptism in the iniquity of human
error; he comments on their false eagerness for death; he responds to all the good wishes
for the tribune, but not that he should cease from correcting the heretics.</p>
<p>The second epistle of Gaudentius is mainly a protest from Scriptural grounds; against
persecution he brings forward the case of Gabinus, who, if bad, should not have been received
without correction, that is, baptism; but if innocent, why kill the innocent Donatists from
whom he came to you? The false rumor about Emeritus, as having turned Catholic, is another
instance of this persecution. The duty of a persecuted pastor is to be a doer of the law
and to lay down his life for the sheep; there is no place whither the persecuted may now flee;
the divine right of free will is restrained by the arbitrary laws of the emperor; persecution
is a note of the Church from the blessings attached to it by Christ and the apostles. The
peace of Christ invites the willing but does not compel the unwilling; a thing very different
from the war-bearing peace and the bloody unity which their oppressors present. We rejoice
in the hatred of the world; there is a martyr host of the apocalypse; Christians may yield up
their souls in testimony against sacrilege, as Razius did. He begs Dulcitius to turn to the
few who have the solidity and not the semblance of truth. God gave prophets not kings to
teach the people: the Saviour sent fishermen not soldiers. God never needs the aid of soldiers.
Gaudentius charges the Catholics with coveting the Donatist possessions. The farewell
is in another handwriting, in which he wishes Dulcitius well, and advises him to pursue a
lenient and temperate course.</p>
<p>The points of Augustin’s reply are in no way different save form from those so constantly
presented, unless there be an increase of roughness and a more hardened idea of the Church’s
right to use coercion. As to Gabinus, the Church’s course with regard to him is a vindication
of the right to receive a convert without rebaptism: in communion with charity and unity
he received the profit of that rite which had been administered among the Donatists. In the
case of Emeritus, Augustin confesses that the rumor of his having turned Catholic was false;
but Emeritus came to Cæsarea of his own will; he came to the Church where a multitude
was present; he could say nothing for his or his party’s defense; he kept quiet. The argument
against suicide from the case of Razius is well made; he died rather in suffering for the state;
and besides the narrative does not commend the deed, but only states it; then too the books
have not the weight that the Law, the Prophets and the Psalms carry with them. The plea

<pb n="690"/>
for correction is precisely as usual. The doctrines of universality and unity and charity are
incidentally brought forward. Circumcelliones, Secundus and Maximianists furnish the
concluding parallels.</p>
<p>Book II. Gaudentius had written a reply to Augustin’s first book. He had taken refuge
under the example of Cyprian; but Augustin now refers him to the writings of Cyprian on
De Simplicitate Prælatorum seu De Catholicæ Ecclesiæ unitate, showing Cyprian’s belief in
the universality of the Church which Augustin expands by the explanation of the term
Catholic. Purgation of the Church is not by separation, but by toleration, as Cyprian too
held in his letter to Maximus and others. The explanation of the field not as the Church,
but rather as the world outside of the Church, had been supported at the Conference and
is repeated by Gaudentius; and also its alternative, that were the field the Church then it
must have perished from the tares which were in it. If so, says Augustin, then the ancestors
of the Donatists would have perished. The period of separation is at the end, when the
Gospel shall have been preached in the whole world. As to their theme of rebaptism, Augustin
replies that he had already before referred him to his Maximianist practice, so that
the action of Agrippinus and Cyprian are vain for him. And then too, according to Cyprian’s
own confession, and Stephen’s testimony, there were crimes in the Church in their day; did
the Church perish then? If so where was Donatus born? If not, then why did the party of
Donatus separate? They are guilty of the very schism which Cyprian particularly deprecated
as a cure, instead of toleration and discipline, for the ills of the Church. As to baptism: The
Catholics recognize the Donatist rite, for the sacrament cannot be lost upon those who receive
it among Catholics and then pass over to heretics; they have the truth but in iniquity; the
truth is not the property of the Donatists. The apostle recognized such truth as he found
among the Gentiles. Gaudentius had vindicated his reference to the tribune’s letter, as to
the Donatists having the names of God and of his Christ, and quoted the passage in proof.
Augustin acknowledges his mistake, which, however, was not intentional, and he apologizes
for the tribune’s error as that of a military man who was not familiar with theology. Since
Gaudentius had called the tribune religious in his first letter, Augustin accuses him of insincerity
and berates him as superstitious. He also corrects Gaudentius for saying that God
sent Jonah not to the king but only to the people of Nineveh, for the king compelled the
humiliation of his subjects. In conclusion he quotes from Cyprian’s letter to Maximus in
behalf of universality and tolerant unity. His exordium is an earnest appeal to the Catholics
to maintain all the notes of the Church. <del>Cp. Retractt. II. lix.</del>.</p>
<p>Felicia had been a Donatist originally and was converted by force. She had devoted
herself to the virgin life and apparently had become head of a religious house; but by reason
of some wicked deeds of the clergy, possibly the extortion and rapacity of Antonius at Fussala,
she was much disturbed and seemed inclined to relapse into her earlier puristic notions, if
not to return to the body that upheld them. To quiet her doubts Augustin writes Ep. ccviii.

<pb n="691"/>
c. 423. The Lord had predicted offenses. There are two kinds of shepherds over the flock,
and will be to the end: the flock too has the good and the bad in it. The gathering is the
present duty, the separation will be the future one; this latter is the Lord’s prerogative. To
abide in unity under such circumstances is a duty until the winnowing, and one is to believe
what these shepherds teach, not what they do. Good and bad are therefore in the world
under the widely diffused Catholic Church; the Donatist has no such note of universality.
Love Christ and the Church, and then He will not permit you to lose the fruit of your virginity
and to perish with the lost. If you go out of this life, separated from the unity of the body
of Christ, this preserved integrity of the body will not profit you. You were compelled to
come in; be thankful to those who compelled you. Show your devotion to the Lord, as your
only hope, by being unmoved with these offenses, and by cleaving to his body, the Church.</p>
<p>A letter addressed to Pope Coelestine is ascribed to Augustin <del>Ep. ccix. c. 423</del>; its authenticity
has been disputed. The author, in giving an account of the appointment of Antonius
as bishop of Fussala, remarks that at Fussala, a castellum about forty miles distant
from Hippo, as in all the adjoining region, there had been a Donatist population; in Fussala
itself there had not been a solitary Catholic; the Punic was the common language. The coercive
measures had converted the whole territory, but the process had also aroused a violent
opposition in the form of robbery, beating, blinding, murder. After its conversion, the distance
from Hippo and the great numbers to be instructed, required a new bishopric, the
history of which and the troubles growing out of it, the author further relates.</p>
<p>In that valuable book De doctrina christiana, (begun in 397, but ended in 426, including
the part having reference to our subject III. xxx. 42), Augustin quotes approvingly from the
book of Tychonius the De septem regulis, and prefaces a discussion of these rules by an allusion
to the treatise of Tychonius, which had refuted some of the narrow and puristic doctrines
of the Church, as held by his own party; this we have already seen was answered by Parmenian,
whose letter in turn was dissected by Augustin. The first, second, fourth and seventh
of these rules bear especially upon the doctrinal points under discussion. <del>Cp. Retractt. II.

at Rome; (d) the Circumcelliones; (e) the schism of Maximian.</p>
<p>This was his parting arrow after the thirty-six years of battle. Catholics and Donatists
passed under the persecutions of the Arian Vandals. Two years after this treatise Augustin

<head>Preface</head>
<p>The schism of the Donatists, with which the treatises in the present volume are concerned,
arose indirectly out of the persecution under Diocletian at the beginning of the
fourth century. At that time Mensurius, bishop of Carthage, and his archdeacon Cæcilianus,
had endeavored to check the fanatical spirit in which many of the Christians courted martyrdom;
and consequently, on the death of Mensurius in 311, and the elevation of Cæcilianus
to the see of Carthage in his place, the opposing party, alleging that Felix, bishop of Aptunga,
by whom Cæcilianus had been consecrated, had been a traditor, and that therefore his
consecration was invalid, set up against him Majorinus, who was succeeded in 315 by
Donatus. The party had by this time gained strength, through the professions that they
made of extreme purity in the discipline which they maintained, and had gone so far, under
the advice of another Donatus, bishop of Casæ Nigræ in Numidia, as to accuse Cæcilianus
before the Roman Emperor Constantine,—thus setting the first precedent for referring a
spiritual cause to the decision of a civil magistrate. Constantine accepted the appeal, and
in 313 the matter was laid for decision before Melchiades, bishop of Rome, and three bishops
of the province of Gaul. They decided in favor of the validity of the consecration of Cæcilianus;
and a similar verdict was given by a council held at Arles, by direction of the Emperor,
in the following year. The party of Majorinus then appealed to the personal judgment of
the Emperor, which was likewise given against them, not without strong expressions of his
anger at their pertinacity. This was followed by severe laws directed against their schism;
but so far from crushing them, the attack seemed only to increase their enthusiasm and
develope their resources. And, under the leadership of Donatus, the successor of Majorinus,
their influence spread widely throughout Africa, and continued to prevail, in spite of various
efforts at their forcible suppression, during the whole of the fourth century. They especially
brought on themselves the vengeance of the civil powers, by the turbulence of certain fanatical
ascetics who embraced their cause, and who, under the name of Circumcelliones, spread
terror through the country, seeking martydom for themselves, and offering violence to every
one who opposed them.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the century, this schism attracted the attention of Augustin, then
a priest of Hippo Regius in Numidia. The controversy seems to have had for him a special
attraction, not merely because of its intrinsic importance, but also because of the field which
it presented for his unrivalled powers as a dialectician. These the Donatists had recently
provoked, by inconsistently receiving back into their body a deacon of Carthage named
Maximianus who had separated himself from them, and by recognizing as valid all baptism
administered by his followers. Hence they naturally shrank from engaging in a contest with
an antagonist who was sure to make the most of such a deviation from the very principles

<pb n="695"/>
on which they based their schism; and, on the other hand, Augustin was so firmly convinced
that his own position was impregnable, that he seems to have thought that if he could only
secure a thorough and dispassionate discussion of the matter, the Donatists must necessarily
be brought to acknowledge not only their theoretical errors, but also the practical sinfulness
of their separation from the Church. Throughout the controversy, however, he appears to
have put out of sight two considerations: first, the influence of party spirit and prejudice
in blinding men to argument; and, secondly, the necessity of treating his opponents in a
logical discussion as on an equal footing with himself. The first was in some degree an unavoidable
element of disappointment; but Augustin made concession yet more difficult on
the part of his opponents, by expecting them to acknowledge his superior position as a
member of the Catholic Church, whose duty it was to expose the error of their views. He
practically begs the very point at issue, by assuming that he, and not the Donatists, was in
the Catholic communion; and though his argument is conducted independently of this
premise, yet it naturally rendered them more unwilling to admit its force.</p>
<p>This dogmatism was of less consequence in the first pamphlet which Augustin published
on the subject,—his Alphabetical Psalm, in which he set forth the history and errors of the
Donatists in a popular form,—since it was not intended as a controversial treatise, but only
as a means of enlightening the less educated as to the Catholic tenets on the question in
dispute. His next work, written in answer to a letter of Donatus of Carthage, in which the
latter tried to prove that the baptism of Christ existed only in his communion, is unfortu-
nately lost; and we can only gather hints as to the further part which he took in the controversy
during the next few years from certain of his letters, especially those to the Donatist
Bishops Honoratus and Crispinus.1142 From the former he claims the admission that the
exclusiveness of the Donatists proves that they are not the Church of Christ; and his letter
to the latter contains an invitation to discuss the leading points at issue, which Crispinus
seems to have declined.</p>
<p>In the year 400 he wrote two books Against the Party of Donatus, which are also lost;
and about the same time he published his refutation of the letter of Parmenianus in answer
to Tichonius, in which he handles and solves the famous question, whether, while abiding
in unity in the communion of the same sacraments, the wicked pollute the good by their
society.1143</p>
<p>Then followed his seven books On Baptism, included in this volume, in which he shows
the emptiness of the arguments of the Donatists for the repetition of baptism; and proves
that so far was Cyprian from being on their side, that his letters and conduct are of the

<pb n="696"/>
highest value as overthrowing their position, and utterly condemning their separation from
the Church.</p>
<p>Not long after this, Petilianus, bishop of Cirta or Constantina, the most eminent theologian
among the Donatist divines, wrote a letter to his clergy against the Catholics, of which
Augustin managed to obtain a copy, though the Donatists used their utmost care to keep it
from him; and he replied to it in two books, written at different times,—the first in the year
400, before he was in possession of the whole letter, the remainder in 402. To the first book
Petilianus made an answer, of which we gather the main tenor from a third book written
by Augustin in reply to it. It appears to have been full of vehement abuse, and to have assumed
the question in dispute, that the existence of the true Church, and the catholicity of
any branch of it, depended on the purity and orthodoxy of all its ministers; so that the guilt
or heresy of any minister would invalidate the whole of his ministerial acts. Hence he argued
that Cæcilianus being the spiritual father of the so-called Catholics, and having been a
traditor, none of them could possibly have been lawfully baptized, much less rightfully ordained.</p>
<p>Augustin admits neither of his assumptions; but, leaving the guilt or innocence of Cæcilianus
as a point which was irrelevant (though practically the case against him utterly
broke down), he addresses himself to the other point, and argues most conclusively that all
the functions of the clergy in celebrating the rites of the Church being purely ministerial,
the efficacy of those rites could in no way depend upon the excellence of the individual
minister, but was derived entirely from Christ. Hence there was a certainty of the grace
bestowed through the several ordinances, which otherwise there could not possibly have
been, had their virtue depended on the character of any man, in whom even an unblemished
reputation might have been the fruit of a skilled hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The third treatise in this volume belongs to a later period, being a letter written to
Bonifacius, the Roman Count of Africa under Valentinian the Third. He had written to
Augustin to consult him as to the best means of dealing with the Donatists; and Augustin
in his reply points out to him his mistake in supposing that the Donatists shared in the errors
of the Arians, whilst he urges him to use moderation in his coercive measures; though both
here and in his answer to Petilianus we find him countenancing the theory that the State
has a right to interfere in constraining men to keep within the Church. Starting with a
forced interpretation of the words, "Compel them to come in," in Luke xiv. 23, he enunciates
principles of coercion which, though in him they were subdued and rendered practically of
little moment by the spirit of love which formed so large an element in his character, yet
found their natural development in the despotic intolerance of the Papacy, and the horrors
of the Inquisition. It is probable that he was himself in some degree misled by confounding
the necessity of repressing the violence of the Circumcelliones, which was a real offense
against the State, with the expediency of enforcing spiritual unity by temporal authority.</p>

<pb n="697"/>
<p>The Donatist treatises have met with little attention from individual editors. There is
a dissertation, De Aur. Augustino adversario Donatistarum, by Adrien Roux, published at
Louvain in 1838;1144 but it is believed that no treatises of this series have ever before been
translated into English, nor are they separately edited. They are in themselves a valuable
authority for an important scene in the history of the Church, and afford a good example
both of the strength and the weakness of Augustin’s writing,—its strength, in the exhaustive
way in which he tears to pieces his opponent’s arguments, and the clearness with which he
exposes the fallacies of their reasoning; its weakness, in the persistency with which he pursues
a point long after its discussion might fairly have been closed, as though he hardly knew
when he had gained the victory; and his tendency to claim, by right of his position, a vantageground
which did not in reality belong to him till the superiority of his cause was proved.</p>

<head>THE
Seven Books of Augustin,
BISHOP OF HIPPO
On Baptism, Against the Donatists</head>
<p>This treatise was written about 400 A.D. Concerning it Aug. in Retract. Book II. c. xviii.,
says: I have written seven books on Baptism against the Donatists, who strive to defend
themselves by the authority of the most blessed bishop and martyr Cyprian; in which I show
that nothing is so effectual for the refutation of the Donatists, and for shutting their mouths
directly from upholding their schism against the Catholic Church, as the letters and act of
Cyprian.</p>

<p>He proves that baptism can be conferred outside the Catholic communion by heretics or
schismatics, but that it ought not to be received from them; and that it is of no avail to
any while in a state of heresy or schism.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>1. In the treatise which we wrote against the published epistle of Parmenianus1145
to Tichonius,1146 we promised that at some future time we would treat the question
of baptism more thoroughly;1147 and indeed, even if we had not made this promise, we are
not unmindful that this is a debt fairly due from us to the prayers of our brethren. Wherefore
in this treatise we have undertaken, with the help of God, not only to refute the objections
which the Donatists have been wont to urge against us in this matter, but also to advance
what God may enable us to say in respect of the authority of the blessed martyr Cyprian,
which they endeavor to use as a prop, to prevent their perversity from falling before the attacks
of truth.1148 And this we propose to do, in order that all whose judgment is not blinded
by party spirit may understand that, so far from Cyprian’s authority being in their favor, it
tends directly to their refutation and discomfiture.</p>
<p>2. In the treatise above mentioned, it has already been said that the grace of baptism
can be conferred outside the Catholic communion, just as it can be also there retained. But
no one of the Donatists themselves denies that even apostates retain the grace of baptism;
for when they return within the pale of the Church, and are converted through repentance,
it is never given to them a second time, and so it is ruled that it never could have been lost.
So those, too, who in the sacrilege of schism depart from the communion of the Church,
certainly retain the grace of baptism, which they received before their departure, seeing that,
in case of their return, it is not again conferred on them whence it is proved, that what they
had received while within the unity of the Church, they could not have lost in their separation.
But if it can be retained outside, why may it not also be given there? If you say, "It is
not rightly given without the pale;" we answer, "As it is not rightly retained, and yet is in
some sense retained, so it is not indeed rightly given, but yet it is given." But as, by reconciliation
to unity, that begins to be profitably possessed which was possessed to no profit in
exclusion from unity, so, by the same reconciliation, that begins to be profitable which
without it was given to no profit. Yet it cannot be allowed that it should be said that that
was not given which was given, nor that any one should reproach a man with not having
given this, while confessing that he had given what he had himself received. For the sacrament
of baptism is what the person possesses who is baptized; and the sacrament of confer-

ring baptism is what he possesses who is ordained. And as the baptized person, if he depart
from the unity of the Church, does not thereby lose the sacrament of baptism, so also he
who is ordained, if he depart from the unity of the Church, does not lose the sacrament of
conferring baptism. For neither sacrament may be wronged. If a sacrament necessarily
becomes void in the case of the wicked, both must become void; if it remain valid with the
wicked, this must be so with both. If, therefore, the baptism be acknowledged which he
could not lose who severed himself from the unity of the Church, that baptism must also
be acknowledged which was administered by one who by his secession had not lost the
sacrament of conferring baptism. For as those who return to the Church, if they had been
baptized before their secession, are not rebaptized, so those who return, having been ordained
before their secession, are certainly not ordained again; but either they again exercise their
former ministry, if the interests of the Church require it, or if they do not exercise it, at any
rate they retain the sacrament of their ordination; and hence it is, that when hands are laid
on them,1149 to mark their reconciliation, they are not ranked with the laity. For Felicianus,
1150 when he separated himself from them with Maximianus, was not held by the
Donatists themselves to have lost either the sacrament of baptism or the sacrament of conferring
baptism. For now he is a recognized member of their own body, in company with
those very men whom he baptized while he was separated from them in the schism of
Maximianus. And so others could receive from them, whilst they still had not joined our
society, what they themselves had not lost by severance from our society. And hence it is
clear that they are guilty of impiety who endeavor to rebaptize those who are in Catholic
unity; and we act rightly who do not dare to repudiate God’s sacraments, even when administered
in schism. For in all points in which they think with us, they also are in communion
with us, and only are severed from us in those points in which they dissent from us. For
contact and disunion are not to be measured by different laws in the case of material or
spiritual affinities. For as union of bodies arises from continuity of position, so in the
agreement of wills there is a kind of contact between souls. If, therefore, a man who has
severed himself from unity wishes to do anything different from that which had been impressed
on him while in the state of unity, in this point he does sever himself, and is no
longer a part of the united whole; but wherever he desires to conduct himself as is customary

<note type="footnote">1150 Felicianus, bishop of Musti, headed the revolt against Primianus, the successor of Parmenianus in the
Carthaginian See. Listening to the complaint of the deacon Maximianus, who had been deposed by Primianus,
a synod was convened in 393 at Cabarsussis, which ordained Maximianus as bishop of Carthage. Hence the
title Maximianistæ. Primianus, in 394, at the council of Bagai, was recognized by 310 bishops. The larger fraction,
according to the Catholics, was subsequently forced into reunion. Prætextatus, bp. of Assuris, was also one of
the leaders in this separation.</note>

in the state of unity, in which he himself learned and received the lessons which he seeks to
follow, in these points he remains a member, and is united to the corporate whole.</p>

<p>3. And so the Donatists in some matters are with us; in some matters have
gone out from us. Accordingly, those things wherein they agree with us we do not forbid
them to do; but in those things in which they differ from us, we earnestly encourage them
to come and receive them from us, or return and recover them, as the case may be; and with
whatever means we can, we lovingly busy ourselves, that they, freed from faults and corrected,
may choose this course. We do not therefore say to them, "Abstain from giving baptism,"
but "Abstain from giving it in schism." Nor do we say to those whom we see them on the
point of baptizing, "Do not receive the baptism," but "Do not receive it in schism." For if
any one were compelled by urgent necessity, being unable to find a Catholic from whom to
receive baptism, and so, while preserving Catholic peace in his heart, should receive from
one without the pale of Catholic unity the sacrament which he was intending to receive
within its pale, this man, should he forthwith depart this life, we deem to be none other than
a Catholic. But if he should be delivered from the death of the body, on his restoring himself
in bodily presence to that Catholic congregation from which in heart he had never departed,
so far from blaming his conduct, we should praise it with the greatest truth and confidence;
because he trusted that God was present to his heart, while he was striving to preserve unity,
and was unwilling to depart this life without the sacrament of holy baptism, which he knew
to be of God, and not of men; wherever he might find it. But if any one who has it in his
power to receive baptism within the Catholic Church prefers, from some perversity of mind,
to be baptized in schism, even if he afterwards bethinks himself to come to the Catholic
Church, because he is assured that there that sacrament will profit him, which can indeed
be received but cannot profit elsewhere, beyond all question he is perverse, and guilty of
sin, and that the more flagrant in proportion as it was committed wilfully. For that he entertains
no doubt that the sacrament is rightly received in the Church, is proved by his
conviction that it is there that he must look for profit even from what he has received elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="705"/>
<head>Chapter 3</head>
<p>4. There are two propositions, moreover, which we affirm,—that baptism
exists in the Catholic Church, and that in it alone can it be rightly received,—both of which
the Donatists deny. Likewise there are two other propositions which we affirm,—that baptism
exists among the Donatists, but that with them it is not rightly received, of which two they
strenuously confirm the former, that baptism exists with them; but they are unwilling to
allow the latter, that in their Church it cannot be rightly received. Of these four propositions,
three are peculiar to us; in one we both agree. For that baptism exists in the Catholic Church,
that it is rightly received there, and that it is not rightly received among the Donatists, are
assertions made only by ourselves; but that baptism exists also among the Donatists, is asserted
by them and allowed by us. If any one, therefore, is desirous of being baptized, and
is already convinced that he ought to choose our Church as a medium for Christian salvation,
and that the baptism of Christ is only profitable in it, even when it has been received elsewhere,
but yet wishes to be baptized in the schism of Donatus, because not they only, nor
we only, but both parties alike say that baptism exists with them, let him pause and look to
the other three points. For if he has made up his mind to follow us in the points which they
deny, though he prefers what both of us acknowledge, to what only we assert, it is enough
for our purpose that he prefers what they do not affirm and we alone assert, to what they
alone assert. That baptism exists in the Catholic Church, we assert and they deny. That it
is rightly received in the Catholic Church, we assert and they deny. That it is not rightly
received in the schism of Donatus, we assert and they deny. As, therefore, he is the more
ready to believe what we alone assert should be believed, so let him be the more ready to do
what we alone declare should be done. But let him believe more firmly, if he be so disposed,
what both parties assert should be believed, than what we alone maintain. For he is inclined
to believe more firmly that the baptism of Christ exists in the schism of Donatus, because
that is acknowledged by both of us, than that it exists in the Catholic Church, an assertion
made alone by the Catholics. But again, he is more ready to believe that the baptism of
Christ exists also with us, as we alone assert, than that it does not exist with us, as they alone
assert. For he has already determined and is fully convinced, that where we differ, our authority
is to be preferred to theirs. So that he is more ready to believe what we alone assert,
that baptism is rightly received with us, than that it is not rightly so received, since that rests
only on their assertion. And, by the same rule, he is more ready to believe what we alone
assert, that it is not rightly received with them, than as they alone assert, that it is rightly so
received. He finds, therefore, that his confidence in being baptized among the Donatists is
somewhat profitless, seeing that, though we both acknowledge that baptism exists with
them, yet we do not both declare that it ought to be received from them. But he has made
up his mind to cling rather to us in matters where we disagree. Let him therefore feel confidence
in receiving baptism in our communion, where he is assured that it both exists and
is rightly received; and let him not receive it in a communion, where those whose opinion

<pb n="706"/>
he has determined to follow acknowledge indeed that it exists, but say that it cannot rightly
be received. Nay, even if he should hold it to be a doubtful question, whether or no it is
impossible for that to be rightly received among the Donatists which he is assured can rightly
be received in the Catholic Church, he would commit a grievous sin, in matters concerning
the salvation of his soul, in the mere fact of preferring uncertainty to certainty. At any rate,
he must be quite sure that a man can be rightly baptized in the Catholic Church, from the
mere fact that he has determined to come over to it, even if he be baptized elsewhere. But
let him at least acknowledge it to be matter of uncertainty whether a man be not improperly
baptized among the Donatists, when he finds this asserted by those whose opinion he is
convinced should be preferred to theirs; and, preferring certainty to uncertainty, let him be
baptized here, where he has good grounds for being assured that it is rightly done, in the
fact that when he thought of doing it elsewhere, he had still determined that he ought afterwards
to come over to this side.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="707"/>
<head>Chapter 4</head>
<p>5. Further, if any one fails to understand how it can be that we assert that
the sacrament is not rightly conferred among the Donatists, while we confess that it exists
among them, let him observe that we also deny that it exists rightly among them, just as
they deny that it exists rightly among those who quit their communion. Let him also consider
the analogy of the military mark, which, though it can both be retained, as by deserters, and,
also be received by those who are not in the army, yet ought not to be either received or retained
outside its ranks; and, at the same time, it is not changed or renewed when a man is
enlisted or brought back to his service. However, we must distinguish between the case of
those who unwittingly join the ranks of these heretics, under the impression that they are
entering the true Church of Christ, and those who know that there is no other Catholic
Church save that which, according to the promise, is spread abroad throughout the whole
world, and extends even to the utmost limits of the earth; which, rising amid tares, and
seeking rest in the future from the weariness of offenses, says in the Book of Psalms, "From
the end of the earth I cried unto Thee, while my heart was in weariness: Thou didst exalt
me on a rock."1151 But the rock was Christ, in whom the apostle says that we are now raised
up, and set together in heavenly places, though not yet actually, but only in hope.1152 And
so the psalm goes on to say, "Thou wast my guide, because Thou art become my hope, a
tower of strength from the face of the enemy."1153 By means of His promises, which are
like spears and javelins stored up in a strongly fortified place, the enemy is not only guarded
against, but overthrown, as he clothes his wolves in sheep’s clothing,1154 that they may say,
"Lo, here is Christ, or there;"1155 and that they may separate many from the Catholic city
which is built upon a hill, and bring them down to the isolation of their own snares, so as
utterly to destroy them. And these men, knowing this, choose to receive the baptism of
Christ without the limits of the communion of the unity of Christ’s body, though they intend
afterwards, with the sacrament which they have received elsewhere, to pass into that very
communion. For they propose to receive Christ’s baptism in antagonism to the Church of
Christ, well knowing that it is so even on the very day on which they receive it. And if this
is a sin, who is the man that will say, Grant that for a single day I may commit sin? For if
he proposes to pass over to the Catholic Church, I would fain ask why. What other answer
can he give, but that it is ill to belong to the party of Donatus, and not to the unity of the
Catholic Church? Just so many days, then, as you commit this ill, of so many days’ sin are
you going to be guilty. And it may be said that there is greater sin in more days’ commission

<pb n="708"/>
of it, and less in fewer; but in no wise can it be said that no sin is committed at all. But what
is the need of allowing this accursed wrong for a single day, or a single hour? For the man
who wishes this license to be granted him, might as well ask of the Church, or of God
Himself, that for a single day he should be permitted to apostatize. For there is no reason
why he should fear to be an apostate for a day, if he does not shrink from being for that time
a schismatic or a heretic.</p>

<head>Chapter 5</head>
<p>6. I prefer, he says, to receive Christ’s baptism where both parties agree
that it exists. But those whom you intend to join say that it cannot be received there rightly;
and those who say that it can be received there rightly are the party whom you mean to
quit. What they say, therefore, whom you yourself consider of inferior authority, in opposition
to what those say whom you yourself prefer, is, if not false, at any rate, to use a milder
term, at least uncertain. I entreat you, therefore, to prefer what is true to what is false, or
what is certain to what is uncertain. For it is not only those whom you are going to join,
but you yourself who are going to join them, that confess that what you want can be rightly
received in that body which you mean to join when you have received it elsewhere. For if
you had any doubts whether it could be rightly received there, you would also have doubts
whether you ought to make the change. If, therefore, it is doubtful whether it be not sin to
receive baptism from the party of Donatus, who can doubt but that it is certain sin not to
prefer receiving it where it is certain that it is not sin? And those who are baptized there
through ignorance, thinking that it is the true Church of Christ, are guilty of less sin in
comparison than these, though even they are wounded by the impiety of schism; nor do
they escape a grievous hurt, because others suffer even more. For when it is said to certain
men, "It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for
you,"1156 it is not meant that the men of Sodom shall escape torment, but only that the
others shall be even more grievously tormented.</p>
<p>7. And yet this point had once, perhaps, been involved in obscurity and doubt. But
that which is a source of health to those who give heed and receive correction, is but an aggravation
of the sin of those who, when they are no longer suffered to be ignorant, persist
in their madness to their own destruction. For the condemnation of the party of Maximianus,
and their restoration after they had been condemned, together with those whom they had
sacrilegiously, to use the language of their own Council,1157 baptized in schism, settles the
whole question in dispute, and removes all controversy. There is no point at issue between
ourselves and those Donatists who hold communion with Primianus, which could give rise
to any doubt that the baptism of Christ may not only be retained, but even conferred by
those who are severed from the Church. For as they themselves are obliged to confess that
those whom Felicianus baptized in schism received true baptism, inasmuch as they now
acknowledge them as members of their own body, with no other baptism than that which
they received in schism; so we say that that is Christ’s baptism, even without the pale of
Catholic communion, which they confer who are cut off from that communion, inasmuch
as they had not lost it when they were cut off. And what they themselves think that they

to reconcilation with themselves, viz., not that they should receive that which they did not
as yet possess, but that what they had received to no advantage in schism, and were already
in possession of, should be of profit to them, this God really confers and bestows through
the Catholic communion on those who come from any heresy or schism in which they received
the baptism of Christ; viz., not that they should begin to receive the sacrament of
baptism as not possessing it before, but that what they already possessed should now begin
to profit them.</p>

<p>8. Between us, then, and what we may call the genuine1158 Donatists,
whose bishop is Primianus at Carthage, there is now no controversy on this point. For God
willed that it should be ended by means of the followers of Maximianus, that they should
be compelled by the precedent of his case to acknowledge what they would not allow at the
persuasion of Christian charity. But this brings us to consider next, whether those men do
not seem to have something to say for themselves, who refuse communion with the party
of Primianus, contending that in their body there remains greater sincerity of Donatism,
just in proportion to the paucity of their numbers. And even if these were only the party
of Maximianus, we should not be justified in despising their salvation. How much more,
then, are we bound to consider it, when we find that this same party of Donatus is split up
into many most minute fractions, all which small sections of the body blame the one much
larger portion which has Primianus for its head, because they receive the baptism of the
followers of Maximianus; while each endeavors to maintain that it is the sole receptacle of
true baptism, which exists nowhere else, neither in the whole of the world where the Catholic
Church extends itself, nor in that larger main body of the Donatists, nor even in the
other minute sections, but only in itself. Whereas, if all these fragments would listen not to
the voice of man, but to the most unmistakable manifestation of the truth, and would be
willing to curb the fiery temper of their own perversity, they would return from their own
barrenness, not indeed to the main body of Donatus, a mere fragment of which they are a
smaller fragment, but to the never-failing fruitfulness of the root of the Catholic Church.
For all of them who are not against us are for us; but when they gather not with us, they
scatter abroad.</p>

<p>9. For, in the next place, that I may not seem to rest on mere human arguments,—
since there is so much obscurity in this question, that in earlier ages of the Church,
before the schism of Donatus, it has caused men of great weight, and even our fathers, the
bishops, whose hearts were full of charity, so to dispute and doubt among themselves, saving
always the peace of the Church, that the several statutes of their Councils in their different
districts long varied from each other, till at length the most wholesome opinion was established,
to the removal of all doubts, by a plenary Council of the whole world:1159—I therefore
bring forward from the gospel clear proofs, by which I propose, with God’s help, to prove
how rightly and truly in the sight of God it has been determined, that in the case of every
schismatic and heretic, the wound which caused his separation should be cured by the
medicine of the Church; but that what remained sound in him should rather be recognized
with approbation, than wounded by condemnation. It is indeed true that the Lord says in
the gospel, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad."1160 Yet when the disciples had brought word to Him that they had seen one casting
out devils in His name, and had forbidden him, because he followed not them, He said,
"Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. For there is no man which shall do
a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me."1161 If, indeed, there were nothing
in this man requiring correction, then any one would be safe who, setting himself outside
the communion of the Church, severing himself from all Christian brotherhood, should
gather in Christ’s name; and so there would be no truth in this, "He that is not with me is
against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad." But if he required correction
in the point where the disciples in their ignorance were anxious to check him, why did
our Lord, by saying, "Forbid him not," prevent this check from being given? And how can
that be true which He then says, "He that is not against you is for you?" For in this point he
was not against, but for them, when he was working miracles of healing in Christ’s name.
That both, therefore, should be true, as both are true,—both the declaration, that "he that
is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad;" and also
the injunction, "Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is for you,"—what must we
understand, except that the man was to be confirmed in his veneration for that mighty
Name, in respect of which he was not against the Church, but for it; and yet he was to be
blamed for separating himself from the Church, whereby his gathering became a scattering;
and if it should have so happened that he sought union with the Church, he should not have
received what he already possessed, but be made to set right the points wherein he had gone
astray?</p>

<p>10. Nor indeed were the prayers of the Gentile Cornelius unheard, nor
did his alms lack acceptance; nay, he was found worthy that an angel should be sent to him,
and that he should behold the messenger, through whom he might assuredly have learned
everything that was necessary, without requiring that any man should come to him. But
since all the good that he had in his prayers and alms could not benefit him unless he were
incorporated in the Church by the bond of Christian brotherhood and peace, he was ordered
to send to Peter, and through him learned Christ; and, being also baptized by his orders, he
was joined by the tie of communion to the fellowship of Christians, to which before he was
bound only by the likeness of good works.1162 And indeed it would have been most fatal
to despise what he did not yet possess, vaunting himself in what he had. So too those who,
by separating themselves from the society of their fellows, to the overthrow of charity, thus
break the bond of unity, if they observe none of the things which they have received in that
society, are separated in everything; and so any one whom they have joined to their society,
if he afterwards wish to come over to the Church, ought to receive everything which he has
not already received. But if they observe some of the same things, in respect of these they
have not severed themselves; and so far they are still a part of the framework of the Church,
while in all other respects they are cut off from it. Accordingly, any one whom they have
associated with themselves is united to the Church in all those points in which they are not
separated from it. And therefore, if he wish to come over to the Church, he is made sound
in those points in which he was unsound and went astray; but where he was sound in union
with the Church, he is not cured, but recognized,—lest in desiring to cure what is sound we
should rather inflict a wound. Therefore those whom they baptize they heal from the wound
of idolatry or unbelief; but they injure them more seriously with the wound of schism. For
idolaters among the people of the Lord were smitten with the sword;1163 but schismatics
were swallowed up by the earth opening her mouth.1164 And the apostle says, "Though I
have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."1165</p>
<p>11. If any one is brought to the surgeon, afflicted with a grievous wound in some vital
part of the body, and the surgeon says that unless it is cured it must cause death, the friends
who brought him do not, I presume, act so foolishly as to count over to the surgeon all his
sound limbs, and, drawing his attention to them, make answer to him, "Can it be that all
these sound limbs are of no avail to save his life, and that one wounded limb is enough to
cause his death?" They certainly do not say this, but they entrust him to the surgeon to be
cured. Nor, again, because they so entrust him, do they ask the surgeon to cure the limbs

<pb n="714"/>
that are sound as well; but they desire him to apply drugs with all care to the one part from
which death is threatening the other sound parts too, with the certainty that it must come,
unless the wound be healed. What will it then profit a man that he has sound faith, or perhaps
only soundness in the sacrament of faith, when the soundness of his charity is done away
with by the fatal wound of schism, so that by the overthrow of it the other points, which
were in themselves sound, are brought into the infection of death? To prevent which, the
mercy of God, through the unity of His holy Church, does not cease striving that they may
come and be healed by the medicine of reconciliation, through the bond of peace. And let
them not think that they are sound because we admit that they have something sound in
them; nor let them think, on the other hand, that what is sound must needs be healed, because
we show that in some parts there is a wound. So that in the soundness of the sacrament,
because they are not against us, they are for us; but in the wound of schism, because they
gather not with Christ, they scatter abroad. Let them not be exalted by what they have.
Why do they pass the eyes of pride over those parts only which are sound? Let them condescend
also to look humbly on their wound, and give heed not only to what they have, but
also to what is wanting in them.</p>

<p>12. Let them see how many things, and what important things, are of no
avail, if a certain single thing be wanting, and let them see what that one thing is. And herein
let them hear not my words, but those of the apostle: "Though I speak with the tongues of
men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all
knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
charity, I am nothing."1166 What does it profit them, therefore, if they have both the voice
of angels in the sacred mysteries, and the gift of prophecy, as had Caiaphas1167 and Saul,1168
that so they may be found prophesying, of whom Holy Scripture testifies that they were
worthy of condemnation? If they not only know, but even possess the sacraments, as Simon
Magus did;1169 if they have faith, as the devils confessed Christ (for we must not suppose
that they did not believe when they said, "What have we to do with Thee, O Son of God?
We know Thee who Thou art"1170; if they distribute of themselves their own substance to
the poor, as many do, not only in the Catholic Church, but in the different heretical bodies;
if, under the pressure of any persecution, they give their bodies with us to be burned for the
faith which they like us confess: yet because they do all these things apart from the Church,
not "forbearing one another in love," nor "endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the
bond of peace," 1171 insomuch as they have not charity, they cannot attain to eternal salvation,
even with all those good things which profit them not.</p>

<p>13. But they think within themselves that they show very great subtlety
in asking whether the baptism of Christ in the party of Donatus makes men sons or not; so
that, if we allow that it does make them sons, they may assert that theirs is the Church, the
mother which could give birth to sons in the baptism of Christ; and since the Church must
be one, they may allege that ours is no Church. But if we say that it does not make them
sons, "Why then," say they, "do you not cause those who pass from us to you to be born
again in baptism, after they have been baptized with us, if they are not thereby born as yet?"</p>
<p>14. Just as though their party gained the power of generation in virtue of what constitutes
its division, and not from what causes its union with the Church. For it is severed from the
bond of peace and charity, but it is joined in one baptism. And so there is one Church which
alone is called Catholic; and whenever it has anything of its own in these communions of
different bodies which are separate from itself, it is most certainly in virtue of this which is
its own in each of them that it, not they, has the power of generation. For neither is it their
separation that generates, but what they have retained of the essence of the Church; and if
they were to go on to abandon this, they would lose the power of generation. The generation,
then, in each case proceeds from the Church, whose sacraments are retained, from which
any such birth can alone in any case proceed,—although not all who receive its birth belong
to its unity, which shall save those who persevere even to the end. Nor is it those only that
do not belong to it who are openly guilty of the manifest sacrilege of schism, but also those
who, being outwardly joined to its unity, are yet separated by a life of sin. For the Church
had herself given birth to Simon Magus through the sacrament of baptism; and yet it was
declared to him that he had no part in the inheritance of Christ.1172 Did he lack anything
in respect of baptism, of the gospel, of the sacraments? But in that he wanted charity, he
was born in vain; and perhaps it had been well for him that he had never been born at all.
Was anything wanting to their birth to whom the apostle says, "I have fed you with milk,
and not with meat, even as babes in Christ"? Yet he recalls them from the sacrilege of schism,
into which they were rushing, because they were carnal: "I have fed you," he says, "with
milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye
able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying and strife, are ye not
carnal, and walk as men? For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos;
are ye not men?"1173 For of these he says above: "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions
among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same
judgment. For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of
the house of Chlöe, that there are contentions among you. Now this I say, that every one
<note type="footnote">1172 Acts viii. 13, 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">1173 1 Cor. iii. 1-4.</note>

<pb n="717"/>
of you saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. Is Christ divided?
was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"1174 These, therefore,
if they continued in the same perverse obstinacy, were doubtless indeed born, but yet would
not belong by the bond of peace and unity to the very Church in respect of which they were
born. Therefore she herself bears them in her own womb and in the womb of her handmaids,
by virtue of the same sacraments, as though by virtue of the seed of her husband. For it is
not without meaning that the apostle says that all these things were done by way of figure.
1175 But those who are too proud, and are not joined to their lawful mother, are like Ishmael,
of whom it is said, "Cast out this bond-woman and her Son: for the son of the bond-woman
shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."1176 But those who peacefully love the lawful
wife of their father, whose sons they are by lawful descent, are like the sons of Jacob, born
indeed of handmaids, but yet receiving the same inheritance.1177 But those who are born
within the family, of the womb of the mother herself, and then neglect the grace they have
received, are like Isaac’s son Esau, who was rejected, God Himself bearing witness to it, and
saying, "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau;"1178 and that though they were twin-brethren, the
offspring of the same womb.</p>

<p>15. They ask also, "Whether sins are remitted in baptism in the party of
Donatus:" so that, if we say that they are remitted, they may answer, then the Holy Spirit
is there; for when by the breathing of our Lord the Holy Spirit was given to the disciples,
He then went on to say, "Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost."1179 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose
soever sins ye retain, they are retained."1180 And if it is so, they say, then our communion
is the Church of Christ; for the Holy Spirit does not work the remission of sins except in
the Church. And if our communion is the Church of Christ, then your communion is not
the Church of Christ. For that is one, wherever it is, of which it is said, "My dove is but one;
she is the only one of her mother;"1181 nor can there be just so many churches as there are
schisms. But if we should say that sins are not there remitted, then, say they, there is no
true baptism there; and therefore ought you to baptize those whom you receive from us.
And since you do not do this, you confess that you are not in the Church of Christ.</p>
<p>16. To these we reply, following the Scriptures, by asking them to answer themselves
what they ask of us. For I beg them to tell us whether there is any remission of sins where
there is not charity; for sins are the darkness of the soul. For we find St. John saying, "He
that hateth his brother is still in darkness."1182 But none would create schisms, if they were
not blinded by hatred of their brethren. If, therefore, we say that sins are not remitted there,
how is he regenerate who is baptized among them? And what is regeneration in baptism,
except the being renovated from the corruption of the old man? And how can he be so
renovated whose past sins are not remitted? But if he be not regenerate, neither does he
put on Christ; from which it seems to follow that he ought to be baptized again. For the
apostle says, "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ;"1183
and if he has not so put on Christ, neither should he be considered to have been baptized
in Christ. Further, since we say that he has been baptized in Christ, we confess that he has
put on Christ; and if we confess this, we confess that he is regenerate. And if this be so, how
does St. John say, "He that hateth his brother remaineth still in darkness," if remission of
his sins has already taken place? Can it be that schism does not involve hatred of one’s
brethren? Who will maintain this, when both the origin of, and perseverance in schism
consists in nothing else save hatred of the brethren?</p>
<p>17. They think that they solve this question when they say: "There is then no remission
of sins in schism, and therefore no creation of the new man by regeneration, and accordingly

<pb n="719"/>
neither is there the baptism of Christ." But since we confess that the baptism of Christ exists
in schism, we propose this question to them for solution: Was Simon Magus endued with
the true baptism of Christ? They will answer, Yes; being compelled to do so by the authority
of holy Scripture. I ask them whether they confess that he received remission of his sins.
They will certainly acknowledge it. So I ask why Peter said to him that he had no part in
the lot of the saints. Because, they say, he sinned afterwards, wishing to buy with money
the gift of God, which he believed the apostles were able to sell.</p>

<p>18. What if he approached baptism itself in deceit? were his sins remitted,
or were they not? Let them choose which they will. Whichever they choose will answer our
purpose. If they say they were remitted, how then shall "the Holy Spirit of discipline flee
deceit,"1184 if in him who was full of deceit He worked remission of sins? If they say they
were not remitted, I ask whether, if he should afterwards confess his sin with contrition of
heart and true sorrow, it would be judged that he ought to be baptized again. And if it is
mere madness to assert this, then let them confess that a man can be baptized with the true
baptism of Christ, and that yet his heart, persisting in malice or sacrilege, may not allow
remission of sins to be given; and so let them understand that men may be baptized in
communions severed from the Church, in which Christ’s baptism is given and received in
the said celebration of the sacrament, but that it will only then be of avail for the remission
of sins, when the recipient, being reconciled to the unity of the Church, is purged from the
sacrilege of deceit, by which his sins were retained, and their remission prevented. For, as
in the case of him who had approached the sacrament in deceit there is no second baptism,
but he is purged by faithful discipline and truthful confession, which he could not be without
baptism, so that what was given before becomes then powerful to work his salvation, when
the former deceit is done away by the truthful confession; so also in the case of the man
who, while an enemy to the peace and love of Christ, received in any heresy or schism the
baptism of Christ, which the schismatics in question had not lost from among them, though
by his sacrilege his sins were not remitted, yet, when he corrects his error, and comes over
to the communion and unity of the Church, he ought not to be again baptized: because by
his very reconciliation to the peace of the Church he receives this benefit, that the sacrament
now begins in unity to be of avail for the remission of his sins, which could not so avail him
as received in schism.</p>
<p>19. But if they should say that in the man who has approached the sacrament in deceit,
his sins are indeed removed by the holy power of so great a sacrament at the moment when
he received it, but return immediately in consequence of his deceit: so that the Holy Spirit
has both been present with him at his baptism for the removal of his sins, and has also fled
before his perseverance in deceit so that they should return: so that both declarations prove
true,—both, "As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ;" and
also, "The holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit;"—that is to say, that both the holiness of
baptism clothes him with Christ, and the sinfulness of deceit strips him of Christ; like the
case of a man who passes from darkness through light into darkness again, his eyes being
always directed towards darkness, though the light cannot but penetrate them as he passes;—if
they should say this, let them understand that this is also the case with those who are baptized
without the pale of the Church, but yet with the baptism of the Church, which is holy in itself,
<note type="footnote">1184 Wisd. i. 5.</note>

<pb n="721"/>
wherever it may be; and which therefore belongs not to those who separate themselves, but
to the body from which they are separated; while yet it avails even among them so far, that
they pass through its light back to their own darkness, their sins, which in that moment had
been dispelled by the holiness of baptism, returning immediately upon them, as though it
were the darkness returning which the light had dispelled while they were passing through
it.</p>
<p>20. For that sins which have been remitted do return upon a man, where there is no
brotherly love, is most clearly taught by our Lord, in the case of the servant whom He found
owing Him ten thousand talents, and to whom He yet forgave all at his entreaty. But when
he refused to have pity on his fellow-servant who owed him a hundred pence, the Lord
commanded him to pay what He had forgiven him. The time, then, at which pardon is received
through baptism is as it were the time for rendering accounts, so that all the debts
which are found to be due may be remitted. Yet it was not afterwards that the servant lent
his fellow-servant the money, which he had so pitilessly exacted when the other was unable
to pay it; but his fellow-servant already owed him the debt, when he himself, on rendering
his accounts to his master, was excused a debt of so vast an amount. He had not first excused
his fellow-servant, and so come to receive forgiveness from his Lord. This is proved by the
words of the fellow-servant: "Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all." Otherwise he
would have said, "You forgave me it before; why do you again demand it?" This is made
more clear by the words of the Lord Himself. For He says, "But the same servant went out,
and found one of his fellow-servants which was owing1185 him a hundred pence."1186 He
does not say, "To whom he had already forgiven a debt of a hundred pence." Since then He
says, "was owing him," it is clear that he had not forgiven him the debt. And indeed it would
have been better, and more in accordance with the position of a man who was going to
render an account of so great a debt, and expected forbearance from his lord, that he should
first have forgiven his fellow-servant what was due to him, and so have come to render the
account when there was such need for imploring the compassion of his lord. Yet the fact
that he had not yet forgiven his fellow-servant, did not prevent his lord from forgiving him
all his debts on the occasion of receiving his accounts. But what advantage was it to him,
since they all immediately returned with redoubled force upon his head, in consequence of
his persistent want of charity? So the grace of baptism is not prevented from giving remission
of all sins, even if he to whom they are forgiven continues to cherish hatred towards his
brother in his heart. For the guilt of yesterday is remitted, and all that was before it, nay,
even the guilt of the very hour and moment previous to baptism, and during baptism itself.
But then he immediately begins again to be responsible, not only for the days, hours, mo-
<note type="footnote">1185 Debebat. Hieron, debebat, LXX. ὤφειλεν.</note>
<note type="footnote">1186 Matt. xviii. 23-35.</note>

ments which ensue, but also for the past,—the guilt of all the sins which were remitted returning
on him, as happens only too frequently in the Church.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">

<head>Chapter 13</head>
<p>21. For it often happens that a man has an enemy whom he hates most
unjustly; although we are commanded to love even our unjust enemies, and to pray for
them. But in some sudden danger of death he begins to be uneasy, and desires baptism,
which he receives in such haste, that the emergency scarcely admits of the necessary formal
examination of a few words, much less of a long conversation, so that this hatred should be
driven from his heart, even supposing it to be known to the minister who baptizes him.
Certainly cases of this sort are still found to occur not only with us, but also with them.
What shall we say then? Are this man’s sins forgiven or not? Let them choose just which
alternative they prefer. For if they are forgiven, they immediately return: this is the teaching
of the gospel, the authoritative announcement of truth. Whether, therefore, they are forgiven
or not, medicine is necessary afterwards; and yet if the man lives, and learns that his fault
stands in need of correction, and corrects it, he is not baptized anew, either with them or
with us. So in the points in which schismatics and heretics neither entertain different
opinions nor observe different practice from ourselves, we do not correct them when they
join us, but rather commend what we find in them. For where they do not differ from us,
they are not separated from us. But because these things do them no good so long as they
are schismatics or heretics, on account of other points in which they differ from us, not to
mention the most grievous sin that is involved in separation itself, therefore, whether their
sins remain in them, or return again immediately after remission, in either case we exhort
them to come to the soundness of peace and Christian charity, not only that they may obtain
something which they had not before, but also that what they had may begin to be of use
to them.</p>

<p>22. It is to no purpose, then, that they say to us, "If you acknowledge our
baptism, what do we lack that should make you suppose that we ought to think seriously
of joining your communion?" For we reply, We do not acknowledge any baptism of yours;
for it is not the baptism of schismatics or heretics, but of God and of the Church, wheresoever
it may be found, and whithersoever it may be transferred. But it is in no sense yours, except
because you entertain false opinions, and do sacrilegious acts, and have impiously separated
yourselves from the Church. For if everything else in your practice and opinions were true,
and still you were to persist in this same separation, contrary to the bond of brotherly peace,
contrary to the union of all the brethren, who have been manifest, according to the promise,
in all the world; the particulars of whose history, and the secrets of whose hearts, you never
could have known or considered in every case, so as to have a right to condemn them; who,
moreover, cannot be liable to condemnation for submitting themselves to the judges of the
Church rather than to one of the parties to the dispute,—in this one thing, at least, in such
a case, you are deficient, in which he is deficient who lacks charity. Why should we go over
our argument again? Look and see yourselves in the apostle, how much there is that you
lack. For what does it matter to him who lacks charity, whether he be carried away outside
the Church at once by some blast of temptation, or remain within the Lord’s harvest, so as
to be separated only at the final winnowing? And yet even such, if they have once been born
in baptism, need not be born again.</p>

<p>23. For it is the Church that gives birth to all, either within her pale, of
her own womb; or beyond it, of the seed of her bridegroom,—(either of herself, or of her
handmaid.1187) But Esau, even though born of the lawful wife, was separated from the
people of God because he quarrelled with his brother. And Asher, born indeed by the authority
of a wife, but yet of a handmaid, was admitted to the land of promise on account of
his brotherly good-will. Whence also it was not the being born of a handmaid, but his
quarrelling with his brother, that stood in the way of Ishmael, to cause his separation from
the people of God; and he received no benefit from the power of the wife, whose son he
rather was, inasmuch as it was in virtue of her conjugal rights that he was both conceived
in and born of the womb of the handmaid. Just as with the Donatists it is by the right of
the Church, which exists in baptism, that whosoever is born receives his birth; but if they
agree with their brethren, through the unity of peace they come to the land of promise, not
to be again cast out from the bosom of their true mother, but to be acknowledged in the
seed of their father; but if they persevere in discord, they will belong to the line of Ishmael.
For Ishmael was first, and then Isaac; and Esau was the elder, Jacob the younger. Not that
heresy gives birth before the Church, or that the Church herself gives birth first to those
who are carnal or animal, and afterwards to those who are spiritual; but because, in the actual
lot of our mortality, in which we are born of the seed of Adam, "that was not first which
is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual."1188 But from
mere animal sensation, because "the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God,"1189 arise all dissensions and schisms. And the apostle says1190 that all who persevere
in this animal sensation belong to the old covenant. that is, to the desire of earthly promises,
which are indeed the type of the spiritual; but "the natural man receiveth not the things of
the Spirit of God."1191</p>
<p>24. At whatever time, therefore, men have begun to be of such a nature in this life, that,
although they have partaken of such divine sacraments as were appointed for the dispensation
under which they lived, they yet savor of carnal things, and hope for and desire carnal things
from God, whether in this life or afterwards, they are yet carnal. But the Church, which is
the people of God, is an ancient institution even in the pilgrimage of this life, having a carnal
interest in some men, a spiritual interest in others. To the carnal belongs the old covenant,
to the spiritual the new. But in the first days both were hidden, from Adam even to Moses.
But by Moses the old covenant was made manifest, and in it was hidden the new covenant,

because after a secret fashion it was typified. But so soon as the Lord came in the flesh, the
new covenant was revealed; yet, though the sacraments of the old covenant passed away;
the dispositions peculiar to it did not pass away. For they still exist in those whom the
apostle declares to be already born indeed by the sacrament of the new covenant, but yet
capable, as being natural, of receiving the things of the Spirit of God. For, as in the sacraments
of the old covenant some persons were already spiritual, belonging secretly to the new covenant,
which was then concealed, so now also in the sacrament of the new covenant, which
has been by this time revealed, many live who are natural. And if they will not advance to
receive the things of the Spirit of God, to which the discourse of the apostle urges them,
they will still belong to the old covenant. But if they advance, even before they receive them,
yet by their very advance and approach they belong to the new covenant; and if, before becoming
spiritual, they are snatched away from this life, yet through the protection of the
holiness of the sacrament they are reckoned in the land of the living, where the Lord is our
hope and our portion. Nor can I find any truer interpretation of the scripture, "Thine eyes
did see my substance, yet being imperfect"1192 considering what follows, "And in Thy book
shall all be written."1193</p>

<p>25. But the same mother which brought forth Abel, and Enoch, and Noah,
and Abraham, brought forth also Moses and the prophets who succeeded him till the coming
of our Lord; and the mother which gave birth to them gave birth also to our apostles and
martyrs, and all good Christians. For all these that have appeared have been born indeed
at different times, but are included in the society of our people; and it is as citizens of the
same state that they have experienced the labors of this pilgrimage, and some of them are
experiencing them, and others will experience them even to the end. Again, the mother
who brought forth Cain, and Ham, and Ishmael, and Esau, brought forth also Dathan and
others like him in the same people; and she who gave birth to them gave birth also to Judas
the false apostle, and Simon Magus, and all the other false Christians who up to this time
have persisted obstinately in their carnal affections, whether they have been mingled in the
unity of the Church, or separated from it in open schism. But when men of this kind have
the gospel preached to them, and receive the sacraments at the hand of those who are spiritual,
it is as though Rebecca gave birth to them of her own womb, as she did to Esau; but
when they are produced in the midst of the people of God through the instrumentality of
those who preach the gospel not sincerely,1194 Sarah is indeed the mother, but through
Hagar. So when good spiritual disciples are produced by the preaching or baptism of those
who are carnal, Leah, indeed, or Rachel, gives birth to them in her right as wife, but from
the womb of a handmaid. But when good and faithful disciples are born of those who are
spiritual in the gospel, and either attain to the development of spiritual age, or do not cease
to strive in that direction, or are only deterred from doing so by want of power, these are
born like Isaac from the womb of Sarah, or Jacob from the womb of Rebecca, in the new
life and the new covenant.</p>

<p>26. Therefore, whether they seem to abide within, or are openly outside,
whatsoever is flesh is flesh, and what is chaff is chaff, whether they persevere in remaining
in their barrenness on the threshing-floor, or, when temptation befalls them, are carried
out as it were by the blast of some wind. And even that man is always severed from the
unity of the Church which is without spot or wrinkle, 1195 who associates with the congregation
of the saints in carnal obstinacy. Yet we ought to despair of no man, whether he be
one who shows himself to be of this nature within the pale of the Church, or whether he
more openly opposes it from without. But the spiritual, or those who are steadily advancing
with pious exertion towards this end, do not stray without the pale; since even when, by
some perversity or necessity among men, they seem to be driven forth, they are more approved
than if they had remained within, since they are in no degree roused to contend
against the Church, but remain rooted in the strongest foundation of Christian charity on
the solid rock of unity. For hereunto belongs what is said in the sacrifice of Abraham: "But
the birds divided he not."1196</p>

enough for the whole Church joining daily in the petition, "Forgive us our debts."</note>

<p>27. On the question of baptism, then, I think that I have argued at sufficient
length; and since this is a most manifest schism which is called by the name of the Donatists,
it only remains that on the subject of baptism we should believe with pious faith what the
universal Church maintains, apart from the sacrilege of schism. And yet, if within the
Church different men still held different opinions on the point, without meanwhile violating
peace, then till some one clear and simple decree should have been passed by an universal
Council, it would have been right for the charity which seeks for unity to throw a veil over
the error of human infirmity, as it is written "For charity shall cover the multitude of
sins."1197 For, seeing that its absence causes the presence of all other things to be of no avail,
we may well suppose that in its presence there is found pardon for the absence of some
missing things.</p>
<p>28. There are great proofs of this existing on the part of the blessed martyr Cyprian, in
his letters,—to come at last to him of whose authority they carnally flatter themselves they
are possessed, whilst by his love they are spiritually overthrown. For at that time, before
the consent of the whole Church had declared authoritatively, by the decree of a plenary
Council,1198 what practice should be followed in this matter, it seemed to him, in common
with about eighty of his fellow bishops of the African churches, that every man who had
been baptized outside the communion of the Catholic Church should, on joining the Church,
be baptized anew. And I take it, that the reason why the Lord did not reveal the error in
this to a man of such eminence, was, that his pious humility and charity in guarding the
peace and health of the Church might be made manifest, and might be noticed, so as to
serve as an example of healing power, so to speak, not only to Christians of that age, but
also to those who should come after. For when a bishop of so important a Church, himself
a man of so great merit and virtue, endowed with such excellence of heart and power of
eloquence, entertained an opinion about baptism different from that which was to be confirmed
by a more diligent searching into the truth; though many of his colleagues held what
was not yet made manifest by authority, but was sanctioned by the past custom of the Church,
and afterwards embraced by the whole Catholic world; yet under these circumstances he
did not sever himself, by refusal of communion, from the others who thought differently,
and indeed never ceased to urge on the others that they should "forbear one another in love,
endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."1199 For so, while the
framework of the body remained whole, if any infirmity occurred in certain of its members,
it might rather regain its health from their general soundness, than be deprived of the chance
of any healing care by their death in severance from the body. And if he had severed himself,

how many were there to follow! what a name was he likely to make for himself among men!
how much more widely would the name of Cyprianist have spread than that of Donatist!
But he was not a son of perdition, one of those of whom it is said, "Thou castedst them down
while they were elevated;"1200 but he was the son of the peace of the Church, who in the
clear illumination of his mind failed to see one thing, only that through him another thing
might be more excellently seen. "And yet," says the apostle, "show I unto you a more excellent
way: though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become
as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."1201 He had therefore imperfect insight into
the hidden mystery of the sacrament. But if he had known the mysteries of all sacraments,
without having charity, it would have been nothing. But as he, with imperfect insight into
the mystery, was careful to preserve charity with all courage and humility and faith, he deserved
to come to the crown of martyrdom; so that, if any cloud had crept over the clearness
of his intellect from his infirmity as man, it might be dispelled by the glorious brightness of
his blood. For it was not in vain that our Lord Jesus Christ, when He declared Himself to
be the vine, and His disciples, as it were, the branches in the vine, gave command that those
which bare no fruit should be cut off, and removed from the vine as useless branches.1202
But what is really fruit, save that new offspring, of which He further says, "A new commandment
I give unto you, that ye love one another?"1203 This is that very charity, without which
the rest profiteth nothing. The apostle also says: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance;"1204 which all
begin with charity, and with the rest of the combination forms one unity in a kind of wondrous
cluster.1205 Nor is it again in vain that our Lord added, "And every branch that beareth
fruit, my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit,"1206 but because those who
are strong in the fruit of charity may yet have something which requires purging, which the
Husbandman will not leave untended. Whilst then, that holy man entertained on the subject
of baptism an opinion at variance with the true view, which was afterwards thoroughly examined
and confirmed after most diligent consideration, his error was compensated by his
remaining in catholic unity, and by the abundance of his charity; and finally it was cleared
away by the pruning-hook of martyrdom.</p>

<p>29. But that I may not seem to be uttering these praises of the blessed
martyr (which, indeed, are not his, but rather those of Him by whose grace he showed
himself what he was), in order to escape the burden of proof, let us now bring forward from
his letters the testimony by which the mouths of the Donatists may most of all be stopped.
For they advance his authority before the unlearned, to show that in a manner they do well
when they baptize afresh the faithful who come to them. Too wretched are they—and, unless
they correct themselves, even by themselves are they utterly condemned—who choose in
the example set them by so great a man to imitate just that fault, which only did not injure
him, because he walked with constant steps even to the end in that from which they have
strayed who "have not known the way of peace."1207 It is true that Christ’s baptism is holy;
and although it may exist among heretics or schismatics, yet it does not belong to the heresy
or schism; and therefore even those who come from thence to the Catholic Church herself
ought not to be baptized afresh. Yet to err on this point is one thing; it is another thing that
those who are straying from the peace of the Church, and have fallen headlong into the pit
of schism, should go on to decide that any who join them ought to be baptized again. For
the former is a speck on the brightness of a holy soul which abundance of charity1208 would
fain have covered; the latter is a stain in their nether foulness which the hatred of peace in
their countenance ostentatiously brings to light. But the subject for our further consideration,
relating to the authority of the blessed Cyprian, we will commence from a fresh beginning.

<p>In which Augustin proves that it is to no purpose that the Donatists bring forward the authority
of Cyprian, bishop and martyr, since it is really more opposed to them than to the Catholics.
For that he held that the view of his predecessor Agrippinus, on the subject of baptizing
heretics in the Catholic Church when they join its communion, should only be received
on condition that peace should be maintained with those who entertained the opposite
view, and that the unity of the Church should never be broken by any kind of schism.</p>

<p>1. How much the arguments make for us, that is, for catholic peace, which
the party of Donatus profess to bring forward against us from the authority of the blessed
Cyprian, and how much they prove against those who bring them forward, it is my intention,
with the help of God, to show in the ensuing book. If, therefore, in the course of my argument,
I am obliged to repeat what I have already said in other treatises (although I will do
so as little as I can,) yet this ought not to be objected to by those who have already read them
and agree with them; since it is not only right that those things which are necessary for instruction
should be frequently instilled into men of dull intelligence, but even in the case of
those who are endowed with larger understanding, it contributes very much both to make
their learning easier and their powers of teaching readier, where the same points are handled
and discussed in many various ways. For I know how much it discourages a reader, when
he comes upon any knotty question in the book which he has in hand, to find himself
presently referred for its solution to another which he happens not to have. Wherefore, if
I am compelled, by the urgency of the present questions, to repeat what I have already said
in other books, I would seek forgiveness from those who know those books already, that
those who are ignorant may have their difficulties removed; for it is better to give to one
who has already, than to abstain from satisfying any one who is in want.</p>
<p>2. What, then, do they venture to say, when their mouth is closed1209 by the force of
truth, with which they will not agree? "Cyprian," say they, "whose great merits and vast
learning we all know, decreed in a Council,1210 with many of his fellow-bishops contributing
their several opinions, that all heretics and schismatics, that is, all who are severed from the
communion of the one Church, are without baptism; and therefore, whosoever has joined
the communion of the Church after being baptized by them must be baptized in the Church."
The authority of Cyprian does not alarm me, because I am reassured by his humility. We
know, indeed, the great merit of the bishop and martyr Cyprian; but is it in any way greater
than that of the apostle and martyr Peter, of whom the said Cyprian speaks as follows in his
epistle to Quintus? "For neither did Peter, whom the Lord chose first, and on whom He
built His Church,1211 when Paul afterwards disputed with him about circumcision, claim
or assume anything insolently and arrogantly to himself, so as to say that he held the primacy,
and should rather be obeyed of those who were late and newly come. Nor did he despise
Paul because he had before been a persecutor of the Church, but he admitted the counsel
of truth, and readily assented to the legitimate grounds which Paul maintained; giving us

thereby a pattern of concord and patience, that we should not pertinaciously love our own
opinions, but should rather account as our own any true and rightful suggestions of our
brethren and colleagues for the common health and weal."1212 Here is a passage in which
Cyprian records what we also learn in holy Scripture, that the Apostle Peter, in whom the
primacy of the apostles shines with such exceeding grace, was corrected by the later Apostle
Paul, when he adopted a custom in the matter of circumcision at variance with the demands
of truth. If it was therefore possible for Peter in some point to walk not uprightly according
to the truth of the gospel, so as to compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Paul writes in that epistle
in which he calls God to witness that he does not lie; for he says, "Now the things which I
write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not;"1213 and, after this sacred and awful calling of
God to witness, he told the whole tale, saying in the course of it, "But when I saw that they
walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all,
If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why
compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"1214—if Peter, I say, could compel the
Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews, contrary to the rule of truth which the Church
afterwards held, why might not Cyprian, in opposition to the rule of faith which the whole
Church afterwards held, compel heretics and schismatics to be baptized afresh? I suppose
that there is no slight to Cyprian in comparing him with Peter in respect to his crown of
martyrdom; rather I ought to be afraid lest I am showing disrespect towards Peter. For who
can be ignorant that the primacy of his apostleship is to be preferred to any episcopate
whatever? But, granting the difference in the dignity of their sees, yet they have the same
glory in their martyrdom. And whether it may be the case that the hearts of those who
confess and die for the true faith in the unity of charity take precedence of each other in
different points, the Lord Himself will know, by the hidden and wondrous dispensation of
whose grace the thief hanging on the cross once for all confesses Him, and is sent on the
selfsame day to paradise,1215 while Peter, the follower of our Lord, denies Him thrice, and
has his crown postponed:1216 for us it were rash to form a judgment from the evidence.
But if any one were now found compelling a man to be circumcised after the Jewish fashion,
as a necessary preliminary for baptism, this would meet with much more general repudiation
by mankind, than if a man should be compelled to be baptized again. Wherefore, if Peter,
on doing this, is corrected by his later colleague Paul, and is yet preserved by the bond of
peace and unity till he is promoted to martyrdom, how much more readily and constantly

should we prefer, either to the authority of a single bishop, or to the Council of a single
province, the rule that has been established by the statutes of the universal Church? For
this same Cyprian, in urging his view of the question, was still anxious to remain in the
unity of peace even with those who differed from him on this point, as is shown by his own
opening address at the beginning of the very Council which is quoted by the Donatists. For
it is as follows:</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">

<head>Chapter 2</head>
<p>3. "When, on the calends of September, very many bishops from the
provinces of Africa,1217 Numidia, and Mauritania, with their presbyters and deacons, had
met together at Carthage, a great part of the laity also being present; and when the letter
addressed by Jubaianus1218 to Cyprian, as also the answer of Cyprian to Jubaianus, on the
subject of baptizing heretics, had been read, Cyprian said: ‘Ye have heard, most beloved
colleagues, what Jubaianus, our fellow-bishop, has written to me, consulting my moderate
ability concerning the unlawful and profane baptism of heretics, and what answer I gave
him,—giving a judgment which we have once and again and often given, that heretics
coming to the Church ought to be baptized, and sanctified with the baptism of the Church.
Another letter of Jubaianus has likewise been read to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere
and religious devotion, in answer to our epistle, he not only expressed his assent, but returned
thanks also, acknowledging that he had received instruction. It remains that we severally
declare our opinion on this subject, judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right of
communion if he differ from us. For no one of us sets himself up as a bishop of bishops,
or, by tyrannical terror, forces his colleagues to a necessity of obeying, inasmuch as every
bishop, in the free use of his liberty and power, has the right of forming his own judgment,
and can no more be judged by another than he can himself judge another. But we must all
await the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone has the power both of setting us in
the government of His Church, and of judging of our acts therein.’"</p>

<p>4. Now let the proud and swelling necks of the heretics raise themselves,
if they dare, against the holy humility of this address. Ye mad Donatists, whom we desire
earnestly to return to the peace and unity of the holy Church, that ye may receive health
therein, what have ye to say in answer to this? You are wont, indeed, to bring up against us
the letters of Cyprian, his opinion, his Council; why do ye claim the authority of Cyprian
for your schism, and reject his example when it makes for the peace of the Church? But
who can fail to be aware that the sacred canon of Scripture, both of the Old and New Testament,
is confined within its own limits, and that it stands so absolutely in a superior position
to all later letters of the bishops, that about it we can hold no manner of doubt or disputation
whether what is confessedly contained in it is right and true; but that all the letters of bishops
which have been written, or are being written, since the closing of the canon, are liable to
be refuted if there be anything contained in them which strays from the truth, either by the
discourse of some one who happens to be wiser in the matter than themselves, or by the
weightier authority and more learned experience of other bishops, by the authority of
Councils; and further, that the Councils themselves, which are held in the several districts
and provinces, must yield, beyond all possibility of doubt, to the authority of plenary
Councils which are formed for the whole Christian world; and that even of the plenary
Councils, the earlier are often corrected by those which follow them, when, by some actual
experiment, things are brought to light which were before concealed, and that is known
which previously lay hid, and this without any whirlwind of sacrilegious pride, without any
puffing of the neck through arrogance, without any strife of envious hatred, simply with
holy humility, catholic peace, and Christian charity?</p>

<p>5. Wherefore the holy Cyprian, whose dignity is only increased by his
humility, who so loved the pattern set by Peter as to use the words, "Giving us thereby a
pattern of concord and patience, that we should not pertinaciously love our own opinions,
but should rather account as our own any true and rightful suggestions of our brethren and
colleagues, for the common health and weal,"1219—he, I say, abundantly shows that he was
most willing to correct his own opinion, if any one should prove to him that it is as certain
that the baptism of Christ can be given by those who have strayed from the fold, as that it
could not be lost when they strayed; on which subject we have already said much. Nor
should we ourselves venture to assert anything of the kind, were we not supported by the
unanimous authority of the whole Church, to which he himself would unquestionably have
yielded, if at that time the truth of this question had been placed beyond dispute by the investigation
and decree of a plenary Council. For if he quotes Peter as an example for his
allowing himself quietly and peacefully to be corrected by one junior colleague, how much
more readily would he himself, with the Council of his province, have yielded to the authority
of the whole world, when the truth had been thus brought to light? For, indeed, so holy
and peaceful a soul would have been most ready to assent to the arguments of any single
person who could prove to him the truth; and perhaps he even did so,1220 though we have
no knowledge of the fact. For it was neither possible that all the proceedings which took
place between the bishops at that time should have been committed to writing, nor are we
acquainted with all that was so committed. For how could a matter which was involved in
such mists of disputation even have been brought to the full illumination and authoritative
decision of a plenary Council, had it not first been known to be discussed for some considerable
time in the various districts of the world, with many discussions and comparisons of
the views of the bishop on every side? But this is one effect of the soundness of peace, that
when any doubtful points are long under investigation, and when, on account of the difficulty
of arriving at the truth, they produce difference of opinion in the course of brotherly disputation,
till men at last arrive at the unalloyed truth; yet the bond of unity remains, lest in the
part that is cut away there should be found the incurable wound of deadly error.</p>

<p>6. And so it is that often something is imperfectly revealed to the more
learned, that their patient and humble charity, from which proceeds the greater fruit, may
be proved, either in the way in which they preserve unity, when they hold different opinions
on matters of comparative obscurity, or in the temper with which they receive the truth,
when they learn that it has been declared to be contrary to what they thought. And of these
two we have a manifestation in the blessed Cyprian of the one, viz., of the way in which he
preserved unity with those from whom he differed in opinion. For he says, "Judging no one
nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from us."1221 And the other,
viz., in what temper he could receive the truth when found to be different from what he
thought it, though his letters are silent on the point, is yet proclaimed by his merits. If there
is no letter extant to prove it, it is witnessed by his crown of martyrdom; if the Council of
bishops declare it not, it is declared by the host of angels. For it is no small proof of a most
peaceful soul, that he won the crown of martyrdom in that unity from which he would not
separate, even though he differed from it. For we are but men; and it is therefore a temptation
incident to men that we should hold views at variance with the truth on any point. But to
come through too great love for our own opinion, or through jealousy of our betters, even
to the sacrilege of dividing the communion of the Church, and of founding heresy or schism,
is a presumption worthy of the devil. But never in any point to entertain an opinion at
variance with the truth is perfection found only in the angels. Since then we are men, yet
forasmuch as in hope we are angels, whose equals we shall be in the resurrection,1222 at any
rate, so long as we are wanting in the perfection of angels, let us at least be without the presumption
of the devil. Accordingly the apostle says, "There hath no temptation taken you
but such as is common to man."1223 It is therefore part of man’s nature to be sometimes
wrong. Wherefore he says in another place, "Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus
minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you."1224
But to whom does He reveal it when it is His will (be it in this life or in the life to come),
save to those who walk in the way of peace, and stray not aside into any schism? Not to
such as those who have not known the way of peace,1225 or for some other cause have broken
the bond of unity. And so, when the apostle said, "And if in anything ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you," lest they should think that besides the way of peace
their own wrong views might be revealed to them, he immediately added, "Nevertheless,
whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule."1226 And Cyprian, walking

by this rule, by the most persistent tolerance, not simply by the shedding of his blood, but
because it was shed in unity (for if he gave his body to be burned, and had not charity, it
would profit him nothing1227), came by the confession of martyrdom to the light of the
angels, and if not before, at least then, acknowledged the revelation of the truth on that point
on which, while yet in error, he did not prefer the maintenance of a wrong opinion to the
bond of unity.</p>

<p>7. What then, ye Donatists, what have ye to say to this? If our opinion
about baptism is true, yet all who thought differently in the time of Cyprian were not cut
off from the unity of the Church, till God revealed to them the truth of the point on which
they were in error, why then have ye by your sacrilegious separation broken the bond of
peace? But if yours is the true opinion about baptism, Cyprian and the others, in conjunction
with whom ye set forth that he held such a Council, remained in unity with those who
thought otherwise; why, therefore, have ye broken the bond of peace? Choose which alternative
ye will, ye are compelled to pronounce an opinion against your schism. Answer me,
wherefore have ye separated yourselves? Wherefore have ye erected an altar in opposition
to the whole world? Wherefore do ye not communicate with the Churches to which
apostolic epistles have been sent, which you yourselves read and acknowledge, in accordance
with whose tenor you say that you order your lives? Answer me, wherefore have ye separated
yourselves? I suppose in order that ye might not perish by communion with wicked men.
How then was it that Cyprian, and so many of his colleagues, did not perish? For though
they believed that heretics and schismatics did not possess baptism, yet they chose rather
to hold communion with them when they had been received into the Church without baptism,
although they believed that their flagrant and sacrilegious sins were yet upon their
heads, than to be separated from the unity of the Church, according to the words of Cyprian,
"Judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from us."
8. If, therefore, by such communion with the wicked the just cannot but perish, the
Church had already perished in the time of Cyprian. Whence then sprang the origin of
Donatus? where was he taught, where was he baptized, where was he ordained, since the
Church had been already destroyed by the contagion of communion with the wicked? But
if the Church still existed, the wicked could do no harm to the good in one communion
with them. Wherefore did ye separate yourselves? Behold, I see in unity Cyprian and others,
his colleagues, who, on holding a council, decided that those who have been baptized without
the communion of the Church have no true baptism, and that therefore it must be given
them when they join the Church. But again, behold I see in the same unity that certain men
think differently in this matter, and that, recognizing in those who come from heretics and
schismatics the baptism of Christ, they do not venture to baptize them afresh. All of these
catholic unity embraces in her motherly breast, bearing each other’s burdens by turns, and
endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,1228 till God should reveal
to one or other of them any error in their views. If the one party held the truth, were they
infected by the others, or no? If the others held the truth, were they infected by the first, or
no? Choose which ye will. If there was contamination, the Church even then ceased to exist;
answer me, therefore, whence came ye forth hither? But if the Church remained, the good
<note type="footnote">1228 Eph. iv. 3.</note>

<pb n="742"/>
are in no wise contaminated by the bad in such communion; answer me, therefore, why did
ye break the bond?</p>
<p>9. Or is it perhaps that schismatics, when received without baptism, bring no infection,
but that it is brought by those who deliver up the sacred books?1229 For that there were
traditors of your number is proved by the clearest testimony of history. And if you had then
brought true evidence against those whom you were accusing, you would have proved your
cause before the unity of the whole world, so that you would have been retained whilst they
were shut out. And if you endeavored to do this, and did not succeed, the world is not to
blame, which trusted the judges of the Church rather than the beaten parties in the suit;
whilst, if you would not urge your suit, the world again is not to blame, which could not
condemn men without their cause being heard. Why, then, did you separate yourselves
from the innocent? You cannot defend the sacrilege of your schism. But this I pass over.
But so much I say, that if the traditors could have defiled you, who were not convicted by
you, and by whom, on the contrary, you were beaten, much more could the sacrilege of
schismatics and heretics, received into the Church, as you maintain, without baptism, have
defiled Cyprian. Yet he did not separate himself. And inasmuch as the Church continued
to exist, it is clear that it could not be defiled. Wherefore, then, did you separate yourselves,
I do not say from the innocent, as the facts proved them, but from the traditors, as they were
never proved to be? Are the sins of traditors, as I began to say, heavier than those of schismatics?
Let us not bring in deceitful balances, to which we may hang what weights we will
and how we will, saying to suit ourselves, "This is heavy and this is light;" but let us bring
forward the sacred balance out of holy Scripture, as out of the Lord’s treasure-house, and
let us weigh them by it, to see which is the heavier; or rather, let us not weigh them for
ourselves, but read the weights as declared by the Lord. At the time when the Lord showed,
by the example of recent punishment, that there was need to guard against the sins of olden
days, and an idol was made and worshipped, and the prophetic book was burned by the
wrath of a scoffing king, and schism was attempted, the idolatry was punished with the
sword,1230 the burning of the book by slaughter in war and captivity in a foreign land,1231
schism by the earth opening, and swallowing up alive the leaders of the schism while the
rest were consumed with fire from heaven.1232 Who will now doubt that that was the worse
crime which received the heavier punishment? If men coming from such sacrilegious
company, without baptism, as you maintain, could not defile Cyprian, how could those
defile you who were not convicted but supposed betrayers of the sacred books?1233 For if

<pb n="743"/>
they had not only given up the books to be burned, but had actually burned them with their
own hands, they would have been guilty of a less sin than if they had committed schism; for
schism is visited with the heavier, the other with the lighter punishment, not at man’s discretion,
but by the judgment of God.</p>

<p>10. Wherefore, then, have ye severed yourselves? If there is any sense left
in you, you must surely see that you can find no possible answer to these arguments. "We
are not left," they say, "so utterly without resource, but that we can still answer, It is our will.
‘Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or
falleth.’"1234 They do not understand that this was said to men who were wishing to judge,
not of open facts, but of the hearts of other men. For how does the apostle himself come to
say so much about the sins of schisms and heresies? Or how comes that verse in the Psalms,
"If of a truth ye love justice, judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?"1235 But why does the Lord
Himself say, "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment,"1236 if
we may not judge any man? Lastly, why, in the case of those traditors, whom they have
judged unrighteously, have they themselves ventured to pass any judgments at all on another
man’s servants? To their own master they were standing or falling. Or why, in the case of
the recent followers of Maximianus, have they not hesitated to bring forward the judgment
delivered with the infallible voice, as they aver, of a plenary Council, in such terms as to
compare them with those first schismatics whom the earth swallowed up alive? And yet
some of them, as they cannot deny, they either condemned though innocent, or received
back again in their guilt. But when a truth is urged which they cannot gainsay, they mutter
a truly wholesome murmuring: "It is our will: ‘Who art thou that judgest another man’s
servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth.’" But when a weak sheep is espied in the
desert, and the pastor who should reclaim it to the fold is nowhere to be seen, then there is
setting of teeth, and breaking of the weak neck: "Thou wouldst be a good man, wert thou
not a traditor. Consult the welfare of thy soul; be a Christian." What unconscionable
madness! When it is said to a Christian, "Be a Christian," what other lesson is taught, save
a denial that he is a Christian? Was it not the same lesson which those persecutors of the
Christians wished to teach, by resisting whom the crown of martyrdom was gained? Or
must we even look on crime as lighter when committed with threatening of the sword than
with treachery of the tongue?</p>
<p>11. Answer me this, ye ravening wolves, who, seeking to be clad in sheep’s clothing,1237
think that the letters of the blessed Cyprian are in your favor. Did the sacrilege of schismatics
defile Cyprian, or did it not? If it did, the Church perished from that instant, and there remained
no source from which ye might spring. If it did not, then by what offense on the
part of others can the guiltless possibly be defiled, if the sacrilege of schism cannot defile

them? Wherefore, then, have ye severed yourselves? Wherefore, while shunning the lighter
offenses, which are inventions of your own, have ye committed the heaviest offense of all,
the sacrilege of schism? Will ye now perchance confess that those men were no longer
schismatics or heretics who had been baptized without the communion of the Church, or
in some heresy or schism, because by coming over to the Church, and renouncing their
former errors, they had ceased to be what formerly they were? How then was it, that though
they were not baptized, their sins remained not on their heads? Was it that the baptism was
Christ’s, but that it could not profit them without the communion of the Church; yet when
they came over, and, renouncing their past error, were received into the communion of the
Church by the laying on of hands, then, being now rooted and founded in charity, without
which all other things are profitless, they began to receive profit for the remission of sins
and the sanctification of their lives from that sacrament, which, while without the pale of
the Church, they possessed in vain?</p>
<p>12. Cease, then, to bring forward against us the authority of Cyprian in favor of repeating
baptism, but cling with us to the example of Cyprian for the preservation of unity. For this
question of baptism had not been as yet completely worked out, but yet the Church observed
the most wholesome custom of correcting what was wrong, not repeating what was already
given, even in the case of schismatics and heretics: she healed the wounded part, but did
not meddle with what was whole. And this custom, coming, I suppose, from apostolical
tradition (like many other things which are held to have been handed down under their
actual sanction, because they are preserved throughout the whole Church, though they are
not found either in their letters, or in the Councils of their successors),—this most wholesome
custom, I say, according to the holy Cyprian, began to be what is called amended by his
predecessor Agrippinus.1238 But, according to the teaching which springs from a more
careful investigation into the truth, which, after great doubt and fluctuation, was brought
at last to the decision of a plenary Council, we ought to believe that it rather began to be
corrupted than to receive correction at the hands of Agrippinus. Accordingly, when so
great a question forced itself upon him, and it was difficult to decide the point, whether remission
of sins and man’s spiritual regeneration could take place among heretics or schismatics,
and the authority of Agrippinus was there to guide him, with that of some few men
who shared in his misapprehension of this question, having preferred attempting something
new to maintaining a custom which they did not understand how to defend; under these
circumstances considerations of probability forced themselves into the eyes of his soul, and
barred the way to the thorough investigation of the truth.</p>
<note type="footnote">1238 Agrippinus was probably the second (some place him still earlier) bishop before Cyprian. He convened
the council of 70 (disputed date), who were the first to take action in favor of rebaptism. Cp. Cypr. Ep. lxxi. 4,

<p>13. Nor do I think that the blessed Cyprian had any other motive in the
free expression and earlier utterance of what he thought in opposition to the custom of the
Church, save that he should thankfully receive any one that could be found with a fuller
revelation of the truth, and that he should show forth a pattern for imitation, not only of
diligence in teaching, but also of modesty in learning; but that, if no one should be found
to bring forward any argument by which those considerations of probability should be refuted,
then he should abide by his opinion, with the full consciousness that he had neither
concealed what he conceived to be the truth, nor violated the unity which he loved. For so
he understood the words of the apostle: "Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the
other judge. If anything be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace."
1239 "In which passage he has taught and shown, that many things are revealed to individuals
for the better, and that we ought not each to strive pertinaciously for what he has once imbibed
and held, but if anything has appeared better and more useful, he should willingly
embrace it."1240 At any rate, in these words he not only advised those to agree with him
who saw no better course, but also exhorted any who could to bring forward arguments by
which the maintenance of the former custom might rather be established; that if they should
be of such a nature as not to admit of refutation, he might show in his own person with
what sincerity he said "that we ought not each to strive pertinaciously for what he has once
imbibed and held, but that, if anything has appeared better and more useful, he should
willingly embrace it."1241 But inasmuch as none appeared, except such as simply urged the
custom against him, and the arguments which they produced in its favor were not of a kind
to bring conviction to a soul like his, this mighty reasoner was not content to give up his
opinions, which, though they were not true, as he was himself unable to see, were at any
rate not confuted, in favor of a custom which had truth on its side, but had not yet been
confirmed. And yet, had not his predecessor Agrippinus, and some of his fellow-bishops
throughout Africa, first tempted him to desert this custom, even by the decision of a
Council, he certainly would not have dared to argue against it. But, amid the perplexities
of so obscure a question, and seeing everywhere around him a strong universal custom, he
would rather have put restraint upon himself by prayer and stretching forth his mind towards
God, so as to have perceived or taught that for truth which was afterwards decided by a
plenary Council. But when he had found relief amid his weariness in the authority of the
former Council1242 which was held by Agrippinus, he preferred maintaining what was in

a manner the discovery of his predecessors, to expending further toil in investigation. For,
at the end of his letter to Quintus, he thus shows how he has sought repose, if one may use
the expression, for his weariness, in what might be termed the resting-place of authority.1243

<p>14. "This, moreover," says he, "Agrippinus, a man of excellent memory,
with the rest, bishops with him, who at that time governed the Church of the Lord in the
province of Africa and Numidia, did establish and, after the investigation of a mutual
Council had weighed it, confirm; whose sentence, being both religious and legitimate and
salutary in accordance with the Catholic faith and Church, we also have followed." 1244 By
this witness he gives sufficient proof how much more ready he would have been to bear his
testimony, had any Council been held to discuss this matter which either embraced the
whole Church, or at least represented our brethren beyond the sea.1245 But such a Council
had not yet been held, because the whole world was bound together by the powerful bond
of custom; and this was deemed sufficient to oppose to those who wished to introduce what
was new, because they could not comprehend the truth. Afterwards, however, while the
question became matter for discussion and investigation amongst many on either side, the
new practice was not only invented, but even submitted to the authority and power of a
plenary Council,—after the martyrdom of Cyprian, it is true, but before we were born.1246
But that this was indeed the custom of the Church, which afterwards was confirmed by a
plenary Council, in which the truth was brought to light, and many difficulties cleared away,
is plain enough from the words of the blessed Cyprian himself in that same letter to Jubaianus,
which was quoted as being read in the Council.1247 For he says, "But some one asks, What
then will be done in the case of those who, coming out of heresy to the Church, have already
been admitted without baptism?" where certainly he shows plainly enough what was usually
done, though he would have wished it otherwise; and in the very fact of his quoting the
Council of Agrippinus, he clearly proves that the custom of the Church was different. Nor
indeed was it requisite that he should seek to establish the practice by this Council, if it was
already sanctioned by custom; and in the Council itself some of the speakers expressly declare,
<note type="footnote">1244 Cypr. Ep. lxxi. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1245 Transmarinum vel universale Concilium.</note>
<note type="footnote">1246 The plenary Council, on whose authority Augustin relies in many places in this work, was either that
of Arles, in 314 A.D., or of Nicæa, in 325 A.D., both of them being before his birth, in 354 A.D. He quotes the
decision of the same council, contra Parmenianum, ii. 13, 30; de Hæresibus 69: Ep. xliii. 7, 19. Contra Parmenianum,
iii. 4, 21: "They condemned," he says, "some few in Africa, by whom they were in turn vanquished by
the judgment of the whole world;" and he adds, that "the Catholics trusted ecclesiastical judges like these in
preference to the defeated parties in the suit." Ib. 6, 30: He says that the Donatists, "having made a schism in
the unity of the Church, were refuted, not by the authority of 310 African bishops, but by that of the whole
world." And in the sixth chapter of the first book of the same treatise, he says that the Donatists, after the decision
at Arles, came again to Constantine, and there were defeated "by a final decision," i.e. at Milan, as is seen from

in giving their opinion, that they went against the custom of the Church in deciding what
they thought was right. Wherefore let the Donatists consider this one point, which surely
none can fail to see, that if the authority of Cyprian is to be followed, it is to be followed
rather in maintaining unity than in altering the custom of the Church; but if respect is paid
to his Council, it must at any rate yield place to the later Council of the universal Church,
of which he rejoiced to be a member, often warning his associates that they should all follow
his example in upholding the coherence of the whole body. For both later Councils are
preferred among later generations to those of earlier date; and the whole is always, with
good reason, looked upon as superior to the parts.</p>

<p>15. But what attitude do they assume, when it is shown that the holy
Cyprian, though he did not himself admit as members of the Church those who had been
baptized in heresy or schism, yet held communion with those who did admit them, according
to his express declaration, "Judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right of communion
if he differ from us?"1248 If he was polluted by communion with persons of this kind, why
do they follow his authority in the question of baptism? But if he was not polluted by
communion with them, why do they not follow his example in maintaining unity? Have
they anything to urge in their defense except the plea, "We choose to have it so?" What
other answer have any sinful or wicked men to the discourse of truth or justice,—the voluptuous,
for instance, the drunkards, adulterers, and those who are impure in any way, thieves,
robbers, murderers, plunderers, evil-doers, idolaters,—what other answer can they make
when convicted by the voice of truth, except "I choose to do it;" "It is my pleasure so"? And
if they have in them a tinge of Christianity, they say further, "Who art thou that judgest
another man’s servant?"1249 Yet these have so much more remains of modesty, that when,
in accordance with divine and human law, they meet with punishment for their abandoned
life and deeds, they do not style themselves martyrs; while the Donatists wish at once to lead
a sacrilegious life and enjoy a blameless reputation, to suffer no punishment for their wicked
deeds, and to gain a martyr’s glory in their just punishment. As if they were not experiencing
the greater mercy and patience of God, in proportion as "executing His judgments upon
them by little and little, He giveth them place of repentance,"1250 and ceases not to redouble
His scourgings in this life; that, considering what they suffer, and why they suffer it, they
may in time grow wise; and that those who have received the baptism of the party of Maximianus
in order to preserve the unity of Donatus, may the more readily embrace the baptism
of the whole world in order to preserve the peace of Christ; that they may be restored to the
root, may be reconciled to the unity of the Church, may see that they have nothing left for
them to say, though something yet remains for them to do; that for their former deeds the
sacrifice of loving-kindness may be offered to a long-suffering God, whose unity they have
broken by their wicked sin, on whose sacraments they have inflicted such a lasting wrong.
For "the Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, plenteous in mercy and truth."1251
Let them embrace His mercy and long-suffering in this life, and fear His truth in the next.
For He willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his way and
live;1252 because He bends His judgment against the wrongs that have been inflicted on
Him. This is our exhortation.</p>

<p>16. For this reason, then, we hold them to be enemies, because we speak
the truth, because we are afraid to be silent, because we fear to shrink from pressing our
point with all the force that lies within our power, because we obey the apostle when he says,
"Preach the word; be instant in season out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort."1253 But, as
the gospel says, "They love the praise of men more than the praise of God;"1254 and while
they fear to incur blame for a time, they do not fear to incur damnation for ever. They see,
too, themselves what wrong they are doing; they see that they have no answer which they
can make, but they overspread the inexperienced with mists, whilst they themselves are being
swallowed up alive,—that is, are perishing knowingly and willfully. They see that men are
amazed, and look with abhorrence on the fact that they have divided themselves into many
schisms, especially in Carthage,1255 the capital and most noted city of all Africa; they have
endeavored to patch up the disgrace of their rags. Thinking that they could annihilate the
followers of Maximianus, they pressed heavily on them through the agency of Optatus the
Gildonian;1256 they inflicted on them many wrongs amid the cruellest of persecutions.
Then they received back some, thinking that all could be converted under the influence of
the same terror; but they were unwilling to do those whom they received the wrong of
baptizing afresh those who had been baptized by them in their schism, or rather of causing
them to be baptized again within their communion by the very same men by whom they
had been baptized outside, and thus they at once made an exception to their own impious
custom. They feel how wickedly they are acting in assailing the baptism of the whole world,
when they have received the baptism of the followers of Maximianus. But they fear those
whom they have themselves rebaptized, lest they should receive no mercy from them, when
they have shown it to others; lest these should call them to account for their souls when they
have ceased to destroy those of other men.</p>

<p>17. What answer they can give about the followers of Maximianus whom
they have received, they cannot divine. If they say, "Those we received were innocent," the
answer is obvious, "Then you had condemned the innocent." If they say, "We did it in ignorance,"
then you judged rashly (just as you passed a rash judgment on the traditors), and
your declaration was false that "you must know that they were condemned by the truthful
voice of a plenary Council."1257 For indeed the innocent could never be condemned by a
voice of truth. If they say, "We did not condemn them," it is only necessary to cite the
Council, to cite the names of bishops and states alike. If they say, "The Council itself is none
of ours," then we cite the records of the proconsular province, where more than once they
quoted the same Council to justify the exclusion of the followers of Maximianus from the
basilicas, and to confound them by the din of the judges and the force of their allies. If they
say that Felicianus of Musti, and Prætextatus of Assavæ, whom they afterwards received,
were not of the party of Maximianus, then we cite the records in which they demanded, in
the courts of law, that these persons should be excluded from the Council which they held
against the party of Maximianus. If they say, "They were received for the sake of peace,"
our answer is, "Why then do ye not acknowledge the only true and full peace? Who urged
you, who compelled you to receive a schismatic whom you had condemned, to preserve the
peace of Donatus, and to condemn the world unheard, in violation of the peace of Christ?"
Truth hems them in on every side. They see that there is no answer left for them to make,
and they think that there is nothing left for them to do; they cannot find out what to say.
They are not allowed to be silent. They had rather strive with perverse utterance against
truth, than be restored to peace by a confession of their faults.</p>

<p>18. But who can fail to understand what they may be saying in their
hearts? "What then are we to do," say they, "with those whom we have already rebaptized?"
Return with them to the Church. Bring those whom you have wounded to be healed by the
medicine of peace: bring those whom you have slain to be brought to life again by the life
of charity. Brotherly union has great power in propitiating God. "If two of you," says our
Lord, "shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for
them."1258 If for two men who agree, how much more for two communities? Let us throw
ourselves together on our knees before the Lord. Do you share with us our unity; let us
share with you your contrition and let charity cover the multitude of sins.1259 Seek counsel
from the blessed Cyprian himself. See how much he considered to depend upon the blessing
of unity, from which he did not sever himself to avoid the communion of those who disagreed
with him; how, though he considered that those who were baptized outside the communion
of the Church had no true baptism, he was yet willing to believe that, by simple admission
into the Church, they might, merely in virtue of the bond of unity, be admitted to a share
in pardon. For thus he solved the question which he proposed to himself in writing as follows
to Jubaianus: "But some will say, ‘What then will become of those who, in times past,
coming to the Church from heresy, were admitted without baptism?’ The Lord is able of
His mercy to grant pardon, and not to sever from the gifts of His Church those who, being
out of simplicity admitted to the Church, have in the Church fallen asleep."1260</p>

<p>19. But which is the worse, not to be baptized at all, or to be twice baptized,
it is difficult to decide. I see, indeed, which is more repugnant and abhorrent to men’s
feelings; but when I have recourse to that divine balance, in which the weight of things is
determined, not by man’s feelings, but by the authority of God, I find a statement by our
Lord on either side. For He said to Peter, "He who is washed has no need of washing a
second time;"1261 and to Nicodemus, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God."1262 What is the purport of the more secret determination
of God, it is perhaps difficult for men like us to learn; but as far as the mere words
are concerned, any one may see what a difference there is between "has no need of washing,"
and "cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven." The Church, lastly, herself holds as her
tradition, that without baptism she cannot admit a man to her altar at all; but since it is allowed
that one who has been rebaptized may be admitted after penance, surely this plainly
proves that his baptism is considered valid. If, therefore, Cyprian thought that those whom
he considered to be unbaptized yet had some share in pardon, in virtue of the bond of unity,
the Lord has power to be reconciled even to the rebaptized by means of the simple bond of
unity and peace, and by this same compensating power of peace to mitigate His displeasure
against those by whom they were rebaptized, and to pardon all the errors which they had
committed while in error, on their offering the sacrifice of charity, which covereth the
multitude of sins; so that He looks not to the number of those who have been wounded by
their separation, but to the greater number who have been delivered from bondage by their
return. For in the same bond of peace in which Cyprian conceived that, through the mercy
of God, those whom he considered to have been admitted to the Church without baptism,
were yet not severed from the gifts of the Church, we also believe that through the same
mercy of God the rebaptized can earn their pardon at His hands.</p>

<p>20. Since the Catholic Church, both in the time of the blessed Cyprian
and in the older time before him, contained within her bosom either some that were rebaptized
or some that were unbaptized, either the one section or the other must have won their
salvation only by the force of simple unity. For if those who came over from the heretics
were not baptized, as Cyprian asserts, they were not rightly admitted into the Church; and
yet he himself did not despair of their obtaining pardon from the mercy of God in virtue of
the unity of the Church. So again, if they were already baptized, it was not right to rebaptize
them. What, therefore, was there to aid the other section, save the same charity that delighted
in unity, so that what was hidden from man’s weakness, in the consideration of the sacrament,
might not be reckoned, by the mercy of God, as a fault in those who were lovers of peace?
Why, then, while ye fear those whom ye have rebaptized, do ye grudge yourselves and them
the entrance to salvation? There was at one time a doubt upon the subject of baptism; those
who held different opinions yet remained in unity. In course of time, owing to the certain
discovery of the truth, that doubt was taken away. The question which, unsolved, did not
frighten Cyprian into separation from the Church, invites you, now that it is solved, to return
once more within the fold. Come to the Catholic Church in its agreement, which Cyprian
did not desert while yet disturbed with doubt; or if now you are dissatisfied with the example
of Cyprian, who held communion with those who were received with the baptism of heretics,
declaring openly that we should "neither judge any one, nor deprive any one of the right of
communion if he differ from us,"1263 whither are ye going, ye wretched men? What are ye
doing? You are bound to fly even from yourselves, because you have advanced beyond the
position where he abode. But if neither his own sins nor those of others could stand in his
way, on account of the abundance of his charity and his love of brotherly kindness and the
bond of peace, do you return to us, where you will find much less hindrance in the way of
either us or you from the fictions which your party have invented.</p>

<p>Augustin undertakes the refutation of the arguments which might be derived from the epistle

<p>1. I think that it may now be considered clear to every one, that the authority
of the blessed Cyprian for the maintenance of the bond of peace, and the avoiding of any
violation of that most wholesome charity which preserves unity in the Church, may be urged
on our side rather than on the side of the Donatists. For if they have chosen to act upon his
example in rebaptizing Catholics, because he thought that heretics ought to be baptized on
joining the Catholic Church, shall not we rather follow his example, whereby he laid down
a manifest rule that one ought in no wise, by the establishment of a separate communion,
to secede from the Catholic communion, that is, from the body of Christians dispersed
throughout the world, even on the admission of evil and sacrilegious men, since he was
unwilling even to remove from the right of communion those whom he considered to have
received sacrilegious men without baptism into the Catholic communion, saying, "Judging
no one, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ from us?"1264</p>

<p>2. Nevertheless, I see what may still be required of me, viz., that I should
answer those plausible arguments, by which, in even earlier times, Agrippinus, or Cyprian
himself, or those in Africa who agreed with them, or any others in far distant lands beyond
the sea, were moved, not indeed by the authority of any plenary or even regionary Council,
but by a mere epistolary correspondence, to think that they ought to adopt a custom which
had no sanction from the ancient custom of the Church, and which was expressly forbidden
by the most unanimous resolution of the Catholic world in order that an error which had
begun to creep into the minds of some men, through discussions of this kind, might be
cured by the more powerful truth and universal healing power of unity coming on the side
of safety. And so they may see with what security I approach this discourse. If I am unable
to gain my point, and show how those arguments may be refuted which they bring forward
from the Council and the epistles of Cyprian, to the effect that Christ’s baptism may not be
given by the hands of heretics, I shall still remain safely in the Church, in whose communion
Cyprian himself remained with those who differed from him.</p>
<p>3. But if they say that the Catholic Church existed then, because there were a few, or,
if they prefer it, even a considerable number, who denied the validity of any baptism conferred
in an heretical body, and baptized all who came from thence, what then? Did the Church
not exist at all before Agrippinus, with whom that new kind of system began, at variance
with all previous custom? Or how, again after the time of Agrippinus, when, unless there
had been a return to the primitive custom, there would have been no need for Cyprian to
set on foot another Council? Was there no Church then, because such a custom as this
prevailed everywhere, that the baptism of Christ should be considered nothing but the
baptism of Christ, even though it were proved to have been conferred in a body of heretics
or schismatics? But if the Church existed even then, and had not perished through a breach
of its continuity, but was, on the contrary, holding its ground, and receiving increase in
every nation, surely it is the safest plan to abide by this same custom, which then embraced
good and bad alike in unity. But if there was then no Church in existence, because sacrilegious
heretics were received without baptism, and this prevailed by universal custom, whence
has Donatus made his appearance? From what land did he spring? or from what sea did he
emerge? or from what sky did he fall? And so we, as I had begun to say, are safe in the
communion of that Church, throughout the whole extent of which the custom now prevails,
which prevailed in like manner through its whole extent before the time of Agrippinus, and
in the interval between Agrippinus and Cyprian, and whose unity neither Agrippinus nor
Cyprian ever deserted, nor those who agreed with them, although they entertained different
views from the rest of their brethren—all of them remaining in the same communion of
unity with the very men from whom they differed in opinion. But let the Donatists themselves
consider what their true position is, if they neither can say whence they derived their
origin, if the Church had already been destroyed by the plague-spot of communion with

<pb n="759"/>
heretics and schismatics received into her bosom without baptism; nor again agree with
Cyprian himself, for he declared that he remained in communion with those who received
heretics and schismatics, and so also with those who were received as well: while they have
separated themselves from the communion of the whole world, on account of the charge
of having delivered up the sacred books, which they brought against the men whom they
maligned in Africa, but failed to convict when brought to trial beyond the sea; although,
even had the crimes which they alleged been true, they were much less heinous than the
sins of heresy and schism; and yet these could not defile Cyprian in the persons of those
who came from them without baptism, as he conceived, and were admitted without baptism
into the Catholic communion. Nor, in the very point in which they say that they imitate
Cyprian, can they find any answer to make about acknowledging the baptism of the followers
of Maximianus, together with those whom, though they belonged to the party that they had
first condemned in their own plenary Council, and then gone on to prosecute even at the
tribunal of the secular power, they yet received back into their communion, in the episcopate
of the very same bishop under whom they had been condemned. Wherefore, if the communion
of wicked men destroyed the Church in the time of Cyprian, they have no source from
which they can derive their own communion; and if the Church was not destroyed, they
have no excuse for their separation from it. Moreover, they are neither following the example
of Cyprian, since they have burst the bond of unity, nor abiding by their own Council, since
they have recognized the baptism of the followers of Maximianus.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="760"/>
<head>Chapter 3</head>
<p>4. Let us therefore, seeing that we adhere to the example of Cyprian, go
on now to consider Cyprian’s Council. What says Cyprian? "Ye have heard," he says, "most
beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus our fellow-bishop has written to me, consulting my
moderate ability concerning the unlawful and profane baptism of heretics, and what answer
I gave him,—giving a judgment which we have once and again and often given, that heretics
coming to the Church ought to be baptized and sanctified with the baptism of the Church.
Another letter of Jubaianus has likewise been read to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere
and religious devotion, in answer to our epistle, he not only expressed his assent, but returned
thanks also, acknowledging that he had received instruction."1265 In these words of the
blessed Cyprian, we find that he had been consulted by Jubaianus, and what answer he had
given to his questions, and how Jubaianus acknowledged with gratitude that he had received
instruction. Ought we then to be thought unreasonably persistent if we desire to consider
this same epistle by which Jubaianus was convinced? For till such time as we are also convinced
(if there are any arguments of truth whereby this can be done), Cyprian himself has
established our security by the right of Catholic communion.</p>
<p>5. For he goes on to say: "It remains that we severally declare our opinion on this same
subject, judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from
us."1266 He allows me, therefore, without losing the right of communion, not only to continue
inquiring into the truth, but even to hold opinions differing from his own. "For no
one of us," he says, "setteth himself up as a bishop of bishops, or by tyrannical terror forces
his colleagues to a necessity of obeying." What could be more kind? what more humble?
Surely there is here no authority restraining us from inquiry into what is truth. "Inasmuch
as every bishop," he says, "in the free use of his liberty and power, has the right of forming
his own judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he can himself judge another,"—
that is, I suppose, in those questions which have not yet been brought to perfect
clearness of solution; for he knew what a deep question about the sacrament was then occupying
the whole Church with every kind of disputation, and gave free liberty of inquiry
to every man, that the truth might be made known by investigation. For he was surely not
uttering what was false, and trying to catch his simpler colleagues in their speech, so that,
when they should have betrayed that they held opinions at variance with his, he might then
propose, in violation of his promise, that they should be excommunicated. Far be it from
a soul so holy to entertain such accursed treachery; indeed, they who hold such a view about
such a man, thinking that it conduces to his praise, do but show that it would be in accordance
with their own nature. I for my part will in no wise believe that Cyprian, a Catholic bishop,
a Catholic martyr, whose greatness only made him proportionately humble in all things, so
<note type="footnote">1265 See above, II. ii. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">1266 See above, II. ii. 3.</note>

<pb n="761"/>
as to find favor before the Lord,1267 should ever, especially in the sacred Council of his colleagues,
have uttered with his mouth what was not echoed in his heart, especially as he further
adds, "But we must all await the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone has the power
both of setting us in the government of His Church, and of judging of our acts therein."1268
When, then, he called to their remembrance so solemn a judgment, hoping to hear the truth
from his colleagues, would he first set them the example of lying? May God avert such
madness from every Christian man, and how much more from Cyprian! We have therefore
the free liberty of inquiry granted to us by the most moderate and most truthful speech of
Cyprian.</p>

<p>6. Next his colleagues proceed to deliver their several opinions. But first
they listened to the letter written to Jubaianus; for it was read, as was mentioned in the
preamble. Let it therefore be read among ourselves also, that we too, with the help of God,
may discover from it what we ought to think. "What!" I think I hear some one saying, "do
you proceed to tell us what Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus?" I have read the letter, I confess,
and should certainly have been a convert to his views, had I not been induced to consider
the matter more carefully by the vast weight of authority, originating in those whom the
Church, distributed throughout the world amid so many nations, of Latins, Greeks, barbarians,
not to mention the Jewish race itself, has been able to produce,—that same Church
which gave birth to Cyprian himself,—men whom I could in no wise bring myself to think
had been unwilling without reason to hold this view,—not because it was impossible that
in so difficult a question the opinion of one or of a few might not have been more near the
truth than that of more, but because one must not lightly, without full consideration and
investigation of the matter to the best of his abilities, decide in favor of a single individual,
or even of a few, against the decision of so very many men of the same religion and communion,
all endowed with great talent and abundant learning. And so how much was suggested
to me on more diligent inquiry, even by the letter of Cyprian himself, in favor of the view
which is now held by the Catholic Church, that the baptism of Christ is to be recognized
and approved, not by the standard of their merits by whom it is administered, but by His
alone of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizeth,"1269 will be shown naturally in
the course of our argument. Let us therefore suppose that the letter which was written by
Cyprian to Jubaianus has been read among us, as it was read in the Council.1270 And I
would have every one read it who means to read what I am going to say, lest he might possibly
think that I have suppressed some things of consequence. For it would take too much time,
and be irrelevant to the elucidation of the matter in hand, were we at this moment to quote
all the words of this epistle.</p>

<p>7. But if any one should ask what I hold in the meantime, while discussing
this question, I answer that, in the first place, the letter of Cyprian suggested to me what I
should hold till I should see clearly the nature of the question which next begins to be discussed.
For Cyprian himself says: "But some will say, ‘What then will become of those who
in times past, coming to the Church from heresy, were admitted without baptism?’"1271
Whether they were really without baptism, or whether they were admitted because those
who admitted them conceived that they had partaken of baptism, is a matter for our future
consideration. At any rate, Cyprian himself shows plainly enough what was the ordinary
custom of the Church, when he says that in past time those who came to the Church from
heresy were admitted without baptism.</p>
<p>8. For in the Council itself Castus of Sicca says: "He who, despising truth, presumes to
follow custom, is either envious or evil-disposed towards the brethren to whom the truth
is revealed, or is ungrateful towards God, by whose inspiration His Church is instructed."1272
Whether the truth had been revealed, we shall investigate hereafter; at any rate, he acknowledges
that the custom of the Church was different.</p>

custom must give way to truth."1274 Clearly, no one could doubt that custom must give
way to truth where it is made manifest. But we shall see presently about the manifestation
of the truth. Meanwhile he also makes it clear that custom was on the other side.</p>

been made, error must give way to truth; for even Peter, who at the first circumcised, afterwards
gave way to Paul when he declared the truth."1275 He indeed chose to say error, not
custom; but in saying "for even Peter, who at the first circumcised, afterwards gave way to
Paul when he declared the truth," he shows plainly enough that there was a custom also on
the subject of baptism at variance with his views. At the same time, also, he warns us that
it was not impossible that Cyprian might have held an opinion about baptism at variance
with that required by the truth, as held by the Church both before and after him, if even
Peter could hold a view at variance with the truth as taught us by the Apostle Paul.1276</p>

baptism of the Church, let no one prefer custom to reason and truth; because reason and
truth always prevail to the exclusion of custom."1277 Nothing could be better, if it be reason,
and if it be truth; but this we shall see presently. Meanwhile, it is clear from the words of
this man also that the custom was the other way.</p>

ought to follow truth rather than custom."1279 By all these declarations it is proved that we
are not excluded from the communion of the Church, till it shall have been clearly shown
what is the nature of the truth, which they say must be preferred to our custom. But if the
truth has made it clear that the very regulation ought to be maintained which the said custom
had prescribed, then it is evident both that this custom was not established or confirmed in
vain, and also that, in consequence of the discussions in question, the most wholesome observance
of so great a sacrament, which could never, indeed, have been changed in the
Catholic Church, was even more watchfully guarded with the most scrupulous caution,
when it had received the further corroboration of Councils.</p>

<p>13. Therefore Cyprian writes to Jubaianus as follows, "concerning the
baptism of heretics, who, being placed without, and set down out of the Church," seem to
him to "claim to themselves a matter over which they have neither right nor power. Which
we," he says, "cannot account valid or lawful, since it is clear that among them it is unlawful."
1280 Neither, indeed, do we deny that a man who is baptized among heretics, or in any
schism outside the Church, derives no profit from it so far as he is partner in the perverseness
of the heretics and schismatics; nor do we hold that those who baptize, although they confer
the real true sacrament of baptism, are yet acting rightly, in gathering adherents outside the
Church, and entertaining opinions contrary to the Church. But it is one thing to be without
a sacrament, another thing to be in possession of it wrongly, and to usurp it unlawfully.
Therefore they do not cease to be sacraments of Christ and the Church, merely because they
are unlawfully used, not only by heretics, but by all kinds of wicked and impious persons.
These, indeed, ought to be corrected and punished, but the sacraments should be acknowledged
and revered.</p>
<p>14. Cyprian, indeed, says that on this subject not one, but two or more Councils were
held; always, however, in Africa. For indeed in one he mentions that seventy-one bishops
had been assembled,1281—to all whose authority we do not hesitate, with all due deference
to Cyprian, to prefer the authority, supported by many more bishops, of the whole Church
spread throughout the whole world, of which Cyprian himself rejoiced that he was an inseparable
member.</p>
<p>15. Nor is the water "profane and adulterous"1282 over which the name of God is invoked,
even though it be invoked by profane and adulterous persons; because neither the creature
itself of water, nor the name invoked, is adulterous. But the baptism of Christ, consecrated
by the words of the gospel, is necessarily holy, however polluted and unclean its ministers
may be; because its inherent sanctity cannot be polluted, and the divine excellence abides
in its sacrament, whether to the salvation of those who use it aright, or to the destruction
of those who use it wrong. Would you indeed maintain that, while the light of the sun or
of a candle, diffused through unclean places, contracts no foulness in itself therefrom, yet
the baptism of Christ can be defiled by the sins of any man, whatsoever he may be? For if
we turn our thoughts to the visible materials themselves, which are to us the medium of the
sacraments, every one must know that they admit of corruption. But if we think on that
which they convey to us, who can fail to see that it is incorruptible, however much the men
through whose ministry it is conveyed are either being rewarded or punished for the character
of their lives?</p>

<p>16. But Cyprian was right in not being moved by what Jubaianus wrote,
that "the followers of Novatian1283 rebaptize those who come to them from the Catholic
Church."1284 For, in the first place, it does not follow that whatever heretics have done in
a perverse spirit of mimicry, Catholics are therefore to abstain from doing, because the
heretics do the same. And again, the reasons are different for which heretics and the Catholic
Church ought respectively to abstain from rebaptizing. For it would not be right for
heretics to do so, even if it were fitting in the Catholic Church; because their argument is,
that among the Catholics is wanting that which they themselves received whilst still within
the pale, and took away with them when they departed. Whereas the reason why the
Catholic Church should not administer again the baptism which was given among heretics,
is that it may not seem to decide that a power which is Christ’s alone belongs to its members,
or to pronounce that to be wanting in the heretics which they have received within her pale,
and certainly could not lose by straying outside. For thus much Cyprian himself, with all
the rest, established, that if any should return from heresy to the Church, they should be
received back, not by baptism, but by the discipline of penitence; whence it is clear that they
cannot be held to lose by their secession what is not restored to them when they return.
Nor ought it for a moment to be said that, as their heresy is their own, as their error is their
own, as the sacrilege of disunion is their own, so also the baptism is their own, which is
really Christ’s. Accordingly, while the evils which are their own are corrected when they
return, so in that which is not theirs His presence should be recognised, from whom it is.</p>

<p>17. But the blessed Cyprian shows that it was no new or sudden thing
that he decided, because the practice had already begun under Agrippinus. "Many years,"
he says, "and much time has passed away since, under Agrippinus of honored memory, a
large assembly of bishops determined this point." Accordingly, under Agrippinus, at any
rate, the thing was new. But I cannot understand what Cyprian means by saying, "And
thenceforward to the present day, so many thousand heretics in our provinces, having been
converted to our Church, showed no hesitation or dislike, but rather with full consent of
reason and will, have embraced the opportunity of the grace of the laver of life and the
baptism unto salvation,"1285 unless indeed he says, "thenceforward to the present day," because
from the time when they were baptized in the Church, in accordance with the Council
of Agrippinus, no question of excommunication had arisen in the case of any of the rebaptized.
Yet if the custom of baptizing those who came over from heretics remained in force
from the time of Agrippinus to that of Cyprian, why should new Councils have been held
by Cyprian on this point? Why does he say to this same Jubaianus that he is not doing
anything new or sudden, but only what had been established by Agrippinus? For why should
Jubaianus be disturbed by the question of novelty, so as to require to be satisfied by the authority
of Agrippinus, if this was the continuous practice of the Church from Agrippinus
till Cyprian? Why, lastly, did so many of his colleagues urge that reason and truth must be
preferred to custom, instead of saying that those who wished to act otherwise were acting
contrary to truth and custom alike?</p>

<p>18. But as regards the remission of sins, whether it is granted through
baptism at the hands of the heretics, I have already expressed my opinion on this point in
a former book;1286 but I will shortly recapitulate it here. If remission of sins is there conferred
by the sacredness of baptism, the sins return again through obstinate perseverance in heresy
or schism; and therefore such men must needs return to the peace of the Catholic Church,
that they may cease to be heretics and schismatics, and deserve that those sins which had
returned on them should be cleansed away by love working in the bond of unity. But if, although
among heretics and schismatics it be still the same baptism of Christ, it yet cannot
work remission of sins owing to this same foulness of discord and wickedness of dissent,
then the same baptism begins to be of avail for the remission of sins when they come to the
peace of the Church,—[not]1287 that what has been already truly remitted should not be
retained; nor that heretical baptism should be repudiated as belonging to a different religion,
or as being different from our own, so that a second baptism should be administered; but
that the very same baptism, which was working death by reason of discord outside the
Church, may work salvation by reason of the peace within. It was, in fact, the same savor
of which the apostle says, "We are a sweet savor of Christ in every place;" and yet, says he,
"both in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savor of life
unto life; and to the other the savor of death unto death."1288 And although he used these
words with reference to another subject, I have applied them to this, that men may understand
that what is good may not only work life to those who use it aright, but also death to those
who use it wrong.</p>

<p>19. Nor is it material, when we are considering the question of the
genuineness and holiness of the sacrament, "what the recipient of the sacrament believes,
and with what faith he is imbued." It is of the very highest consequence as regards the entrance
into salvation, but is wholly immaterial as regards the question of the sacrament.
For it is quite possible that a man may be possessed of the genuine sacrament and a corrupted
faith, as it is possible that he may hold the words of the creed in their integrity, and yet entertain
an erroneous belief about the Trinity, or the resurrection, or any other point. For it
is no slight matter, even within the Catholic Church itself, to hold a faith entirely consistent
with the truth about even God Himself, to say nothing of any of His creatures. Is it then to
be maintained, that if any one who has been baptized within the Catholic Church itself
should afterwards, in the course of reading, or by listening to instruction, or by quiet argument,
find out, through God’s own revelation, that he had before believed otherwise than
he ought, it is requisite that he should therefore be baptized afresh? But what carnal and
natural man is there who does not stray through the vain conceits1289 of his own heart, and
picture God’s nature to himself to be such as he has imagined out of his carnal sense, and
differ from the true conception of God as far as vanity from truth? Most truly, indeed,
speaks the apostle, filled with the light of truth: "The natural man," says he, "receiveth not
the things of the Spirit of God."1290 And yet herein he was speaking of men whom he
himself shows to have been baptized. For he says to them, "Was Paul crucified for you? or
were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"1291 These men had therefore the sacrament of
baptism; and yet, inasmuch as their wisdom was of the flesh, what could they believe about
God otherwise than according to the perception of their flesh, according to which "the natural
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God?" To such he says: "I could not speak
unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you
with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are
ye able. For ye are yet carnal."1292 For such are carried about with every wind of doctrine,
of which kind he says, "That we be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about
with every wind of doctrine."1293 It is then true that, if these men shall have advanced even
to the spiritual age of the inner man, and in the integrity of understanding shall have learned
how far different from the requirements of the truth has been the belief which they have
been led by the fallacious character of their conceits to entertain of God, they are therefore
to be baptized again? For, on this principle, it would be possible for a Catholic catechumen

<pb n="773"/>
to light upon the writings of some heretic, and, not having the knowledge requisite for discerning
truth from error, he might entertain some belief contrary to the Catholic faith, yet
not condemned by the words of the creed, just as, under color of the same words, innumerable
heretical errors have sprung up. Supposing, then, that the catechumen was under the
impression that he was studying the work of some great and learned Catholic, and was
baptized with that belief in the Catholic Church, and by subsequent research should discover
what he ought to believe, so that, embracing the Catholic faith, he should reject his former
error, ought he, on confessing this, to be baptized again? Or supposing that, before learning
and confessing this for himself, he should be found to entertain such an opinion, and should
be taught what he ought to reject and what he should believe, and it were to become clear
that he had held this false belief when he was baptized, ought he therefore to be baptized
again? Why should we maintain the contrary? Because the sanctity of the sacrament, consecrated
in the words of the gospel, remains upon him in its integrity, just as he received it
from the hands of the minister, although he, being firmly rooted in the vanity of his carnal
mind entertained a belief other than was right at the time when he was baptized. Wherefore
it is manifest that it is possible that, with defective faith, the sacrament of baptism may yet
remain without defect in any man; and therefore all that is said about the diversity of the
several heretics is beside the question. For in each person that is to be corrected which is
found to be amiss by the man who undertakes his correction. That is to be made whole
which is unsound; that is to be given which is wanting, and, above all, the peace of Christian
charity, without which the rest is profitless. Yet, as the rest is there, we must not administer
it as though it were wanting, only take care that its possession be to the profit, not the hurt
of him who has it, through the very bond of peace and excellence of charity.</p>

<p>20. Accordingly, if Marcion consecrated the sacrament of baptism with
the words of the gospel, "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost,"1294 the sacrament was complete, although his faith expressed under the same words,
seeing that he held opinions not taught by the Catholic truth, was not complete, but stained
with the falsity of fables.1295 For under these same words, "In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," not Marcion only, or Valentinus, or Arius, or Eunomius,
but the carnal babes of the Church themselves (to whom the apostle said, "I could not speak
unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal"), if they could be individually asked for an
accurate exposition of their opinions, would probably show a diversity of opinions as numerous
as the persons who held them, "for the natural man receiveth not the things of the
Spirit of God." Can it, however, be said on this account that they do not receive the complete
sacrament? or that, if they shall advance, and correct the vanity of their carnal opinions,
they must seek again what they had received? Each man receives after the fashion of his
own faith; yet how much does he obtain under the guidance of that mercy of God, in the
confident assurance of which the same apostle says, "If in anything ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you"?1296 Yet the snares of heretics and schismatics prove
for this reason only too pernicious to the carnally-minded, because their very progress is
intercepted when their vain opinions are confirmed in opposition to the Catholic truth, and
the perversity of their dissension is strengthened against the Catholic peace. Yet if the sacraments
are the same, they are everywhere complete, even when they are wrongly understood,
and perverted to be instruments of discord, just as the very writings of the gospel, if they
are only the same, are everywhere complete, even though quoted with a boundless variety
of false opinions. For as to what Jeremiah says:—"Why do those who grieve me prevail
against me? My wound is stubborn, whence shall I be healed? In its origin it became unto
me as lying water, having no certainty,"1297—if the term "water" were never used figuratively
and in the allegorical language of prophecy except to signify baptism, we should have trouble
in discovering what these words of Jeremiah meant; but as it is, when "waters" are expressly
used in the Apocalypse1298 to signify "peoples," I do not see why, by "lying water having no
certainty," I should not understand, a "lying people, whom I cannot trust."</p>

<p>21. But when it is said that "the Holy Spirit is given by the imposition of
hands in the Catholic Church only, I suppose that our ancestors meant that we should understand
thereby what the apostle says, "Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."1299 For this is that very love which is wanting
in all who are cut off from the communion of the Catholic Church; and for lack of this,
"though they speak with the tongues of men and of angels, though they understand all
mysteries and all knowledge, and though they have the gift of prophecy, and all faith, so
that they could remove mountains, and though they bestow all their goods to feed the poor,
and though they give their bodies to be burned, it profiteth them nothing." 1300 But those
are wanting in God’s love who do not care for the unity of the Church; and consequently
we are right in understanding that the Holy Spirit may be said not to be received except in
the Catholic Church. For the Holy Spirit is not only given by the laying on of hands amid
the testimony of temporal sensible miracles, as He was given in former days to be the credentials
of a rudimentary faith, and for the extension of the first beginnings of the Church.
For who expects in these days that those on whom hands are laid that they may receive the
Holy Spirit should forthwith begin to speak with tongues? but it is understood that invisibly
and imperceptibly, on account of the bond of peace, divine love is breathed into their hearts,
so that they may be able to say, "Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost which is given unto us." But there are many operations of the Holy Spirit, which
the same apostle commemorates in a certain passage at such length as he thinks sufficient,
and then concludes: "But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to
every man severally as He will."1301 Since, then, the sacrament is one thing, which even Simon
Magus could have;1302 and the operation of the Spirit is another thing, which is even
often found in wicked men, as Saul had the gift of prophecy;1303 and that operation of the
same Spirit is a third thing, which only the good can have, as "the end of the commandment
is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:"1304 whatever,
therefore, may be received by heretics and schismatics, the charity which covereth the
multitude of sins is the especial gift of Catholic unity and peace; nor is it found in all that
are within that bond, since not all that are within it are of it, as we shall see in the proper
place. At any rate, outside the bond that love cannot exist, without which all the other requisites,
even if they can be recognized and approved, cannot profit or release from sin.

<p>22. "For as regards the fact that to preserve the figure of unity the Lord
gave the power to Peter that whatsoever he should loose on earth should be loosed,"1306 it
is clear that that unity is also described as one dove without fault.1307 Can it be said, then,
that to this same dove belong all those greedy ones, whose existence in the same Catholic
Church Cyprian himself so grievously bewailed? For birds of prey, I believe, cannot be
called doves, but rather hawks. How then did they baptize those who used to plunder estates
by treacherous deceit, and increase their profits by compound usury,1308 if baptism is only
given by that indivisible and chaste and perfect dove, that unity which can only be understood
as existing among the good? Is it possible that, by the prayers of the saints who are spiritual
within the Church, as though by the frequent lamentations of the dove, a great sacrament
is dispensed, with a secret administration of the mercy of God, so that their sins also are
loosed who are baptized, not by the dove but by the hawk, if they come to that sacrament
in the peace of Catholic unity? But if this be so, why should it not also be the case that, as
each man comes from heresy or schism to the Catholic peace, his sins should be loosed
through their prayers? But the integrity of the sacrament is everywhere recognized, though
it will not avail for the irrevocable remission of sins outside the unity of the Church. Nor
will the prayers of the saints, or, in other words, the groanings of that one dove, be able to
help one who is set in heresy or schism; just as they are not able to help one who is placed
within the Church, if by a wicked life he himself retain the debts of his sins against himself,
and that though he be baptized, not by this hawk, but by the pious ministry of the dove
herself.</p>

<p>23. "As my Father hath sent me," says our Lord, "even so send I you. And
what He had said this, He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy
Ghost. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye
retain, they are retained."1309 Therefore, if they represented the Church, and this was said
to them as to the Church herself, it follows that the peace of the Church looses sins, and estrangement
from the Church retains them, not according to the will of men, but according
to the will of God and the prayers of the saints who are spiritual, who "judge all things, but
themselves are judged of no man."1310 For the rock retains, the rock remits; the dove retains,
the dove remits; unity retains, unity remits. But the peace of this unity exists only in the
good, in those who are either already spiritual, or are advancing by the obedience of concord
to spiritual things; it exists not in the bad, whether they make disturbances abroad, or are
endured within the Church with lamentations, baptizing and being baptized. But just as
those who are tolerated with groanings within the Church, although they do not belong to
the same unity of the dove, and to that "glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any
such thing,"1311 yet if they are corrected, and confess that they approached to baptism most
unworthily, are not baptized again, but begin to belong to the dove, through whose groans
those sins are remitted which were retained in them who were estranged from her peace;
so those also who are more openly without the Church, if they have received the same sacraments,
are not freed from their sins on coming, after correction, to the unity of the Church,
by a repetition of baptism, but by the same law of charity and bond of unity. For if "those
only may baptize who are set over the Church, and established by the law of the gospel and
ordination as appointed by the Lord," were they in any wise of this kind who seized on estates
by treacherous frauds, and increased their gains by compound interest? I trow not, since
those are established by ordination as appointed of the Lord, of whom the apostle, in giving
them a standard, says, "Not greedy, not given to filthy lucre." 1312 Yet men of this kind used
to baptize in the time of Cyprian himself; and he confesses with many lamentations that
they were his fellow-bishops, and endures them with the great reward of tolerance. Yet did
they not confer remission of sins, which is granted through the prayers of the saints, that
is, the groans of the dove, whoever it be that baptizes, if those to whom it is given belong to
her peace. For the Lord would not say to robbers and usurers, "Whose soever sins ye remit,
they shall be remitted to him; and whose soever sins ye retain, they shall be retained."
"Outside the Church, indeed, nothing can be either bound or loosed, since there there is no
one who can either bind or loose;" but he is loosed who has made peace with the dove, and

hands were laid on those whom Philip the deacon had baptized,1316 are saying what is quite
beside the point; and far be it from us, in seeking the truth, to use such arguments as this.
Wherefore we are all the further from "yielding to heretics,"1317 if we deny that what they
possess of Christ’s Church is their own property, and do not refuse to acknowledge the
standard of our General because of the crimes of deserters; nay, all the more because "the
Lord our God is a jealous God,"1318 let us refuse, whenever we see anything of His with an
alien, to allow him to consider it his own. For of a truth the jealous God Himself rebukes
the woman who commits fornication against Him, as the type of an erring people, and says
that she gave to her lovers what belonged to Him, and again received from them what was
not theirs but His. In the hands of the adulterous woman and the adulterous lovers, God
in His wrath, as a jealous God, recognizes His gifts; and do we say that baptism, consecrated
in the words of the gospel, belongs to heretics? and are we willing, from consideration of
their deeds, to attribute to them even what belongs to God, as though they had the power
to pollute it, or as though they could make what is God’s to be their own, because they
themselves have refused to belong to God?</p>
<p>26. Who is that adulterous woman whom the prophet Hosea points out, who said, "I
will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and
everything that befits me?"1319 Let us grant that we may understand this also of the people
of the Jews that went astray; yet whom else are the false Christians (such as are all heretics
and schismatics) wont to imitate, except false Israelites? For there were also true Israelites,
as the Lord Himself bears witness to Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
guile."1320 But who are true Christians, save those of whom the same Lord said, "He that
hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me?"1321 But what is it to
keep His commandments, except to abide in love? Whence also He says, "A new commandment
I give unto you, that ye love one another;" and again, "By this shall all men know that
ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."1322 But who can doubt that this was

spoken not only to those who heard His words with their fleshly ears when He was present
with them, but also to those who learn His words through the gospel, when He is sitting on
His throne in heaven? For He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill.1323 But the fulfilling
of the law is love.1324 And in this Cyprian abounded greatly, insomuch that though he held
a different view concerning baptism, he yet did not forsake the unity of the Church, and
was in the Lord’s vine a branch firmly rooted, bearing fruit, which the heavenly Husbandman
purged with the knife of suffering, that it should bear more fruit.1325 But the enemies of
this brotherly love, whether they are openly without, or appear to be within, are false
Christians, and antichrists. For when they have found an opportunity, they go out, as it is
written: "A man wishing to separate himself from his friends, seeketh opportunities."1326
But even if occasions are wanting, while they seem to be within, they are severed from that
invisible bond of love. Whence St. John says, "They went out from us, but they were not of
us; for had they been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us."1327 He does not
say that they ceased to be of us by going out, but that they went out because they were not
of us. The Apostle Paul also speaks of certain men who had erred concerning the truth, and
were overthrowing the faith of some; whose word was eating as a canker. Yet in saying that
they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that they were all in one great house, but
as vessels to dishonor,—I suppose because they had not as yet gone out. Or if they had
already gone out, how can he say that they were in the same great house with the honorable
vessels, unless it was in virtue of the sacraments themselves, which even in the severed
meetings of heretics are not changed, that he speaks of all as belonging to the same great
house, though in different degrees of esteem, some to honor and some to dishonor? For
thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy: "But shun profane and vain babblings; for they
will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is
Hymenæus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection
is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth
firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let every one that
nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only
vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some
to dishonor. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor,
sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work."1328 But

what is it to purge oneself from such as these, except what he said just before, "Let every one
that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity." And lest any one should think that,
as being in one great house with them, he might perish with such as these, he has most
carefully forewarned them, "The Lord knoweth them that are His,"—those, namely, who,
by departing from iniquity, purge themselves from the vessels made to dishonor, lest they
should perish with them whom they are compelled to tolerate in the great house.</p>
<p>27. They, therefore, who are wicked, evildoers, carnal, fleshly, devilish, think that they
receive at the hands of their seducers what are the gifts of God alone, whether sacraments,
or any spiritual workings about present salvation. But these men have not love towards
God, but are busied about those by whose pride they are led astray, and are compared to
the adulterous woman, whom the prophet introduces as saying, "I will go after my lovers,
that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and my oil, and everything that
befits me." For thus arise heresies and schisms, when the fleshly people which is not founded
on the love of God says, "I will go after my lovers," with whom, either by corruption of her
faith, or by the puffing up of her pride, she shamefully commits adultery. But for the sake
of those who, having undergone the difficulties, and straits, and barriers of the empty reasoning
of those by whom they are led astray, afterwards feel the prickings of fear, and return
to the way of peace, to seeking God in all sincerity,—for their sake He goes on to say,
"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not
find her paths. And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them: and
she shall seek them, but she shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to
my first husband; for then was it better with me than now." Then, that they may not attribute
to their seducers what they have that is sound, and derived from the doctrine of truth, by
which they lead them astray to the falseness of their own dogmas and dissensions; that they
may not think that what is sound in them belongs to them, he immediately added, "And
she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her money; but she
made vessels of gold and silver for Baal."1329 For she had said above, "I will go after my
lovers, that give me my bread," etc., not at all understanding that all this, which was held
soundly and lawfully by her seducers, was of God, and not of men. Nor would even they
themselves claim these things for themselves, and as it were assert a right in them, had not
they in turn been led astray by a people which had gone astray, when faith is reposed in
them, and such honors are paid to them, that they should be enabled thereby to say such
things, and claim such things for themselves, that their error should be called truth, and
their iniquity be thought righteousness, in virtue of the sacraments and Scriptures, which
they hold, not for salvation, but only in appearance. Accordingly, the same adulterous woman
is addressed by the mouth of Ezekiel: "Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and
<note type="footnote">1329 Hos. ii. 5-8, cp. LXX.</note>

<pb n="783"/>
of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit
whoredom with them; and tookest my1330 broidered garments, and coveredst them: and
thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them. My meat also which I gave thee, fine
flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before thine idols for a
sweet savor: and this thou hast done."1331 For she turns all the sacraments, and the words
of the sacred books, to the images of her own idols, with which her carnal mind delights to
wallow. Nor yet, because those images are false, and the doctrines of devils, speaking lies
in hypocrisy,1332 are those sacraments and divine utterances therefore so to lose their due
honor, as to be thought to belong to such as these; seeing that the Lord says," Of my gold,
and my silver, and my broidered garments, and mine oil, and mine incense, and my meat,"
and so forth. Ought we, because those erring ones think that these things belong to their
seducers, therefore not to recognize whose they really are, when He Himself says, "And she
did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her money"? For He
did not say that she did not have these things because she was an adulteress; but she is said
to have had them, and that not as belonging to herself or her lovers, but to God, whose alone
they are. Although, therefore, she had her fornication, yet those things wherewith she adorned
it, whether as seduced or in her turn seducing, belonged not to her, but to God. If
these things were spoken in a figure of the Jewish nation, when the scribes and Pharisees
were rejecting the commandment of God in order to set up their own traditions, so that
they were in a manner committing whoredom with a people which was abandoning their
God; and yet for all that, whoredom at that time among the people, such as the Lord brought
to light by convicting it, did not cause that the mysteries should belong to them, which were
not theirs but God’s, who, in speaking to the adulteress, says that all these things were His;
whence the Lord Himself also sent those whom He cleansed from leprosy to the same
mysteries, that they should offer sacrifice for themselves before the priests, because that
sacrifice had not become efficacious for them, which He Himself afterwards wished to be
commemorated in the Church for all of them, because He Himself proclaimed the tidings
to them all;—if this be so, how much the more ought we, when we find the sacraments of
the New Testament among certain heretics or schismatics, not to attribute them to these
men, nor to condemn them, as though we could not recognize them? We ought to recognize
the gifts of the true husband, though in the possession of an adulteress, and to amend, by
the word of truth, that whoredom which is the true possession of the unchaste woman, instead
of finding fault with the gifts, which belong entirely to the pitying Lord.</p>

<p>28. From these considerations, and such as these, our forefathers, not only before the
time of Cyprian and Agrippinus, but even afterwards, maintained a most wholesome custom,
that whenever they found anything divine and lawful remaining in its integrity even in the
midst of any heresy or schism, they approved rather than repudiated it; but whatever they
found that was alien, and peculiar to that false doctrine or division, this they convicted in
the light of the truth, and healed. The points, however, which remain to be considered in
the letter written by Jubaianus, must, I think, when looking at the size of this book, be taken
in hand and treated with a fresh beginning.</p>

<head>Chapter 1</head>
<p>1. The comparison of the Church with Paradise1333 shows us that men
may indeed receive her baptism outside her pale, but that no one outside can either receive
or retain the salvation of eternal happiness. For, as the words of Scripture testify, the streams
from the fountain of Paradise flowed copiously even beyond its bounds. Record indeed is
made of their names; and through what countries they flow, and that they are situated beyond
the limits of Paradise, is known to all;1334 and yet in Mesopotamia, and in Egypt, to which
countries those rivers extended, there is not found that blessedness of life which is recorded
in Paradise. Accordingly, though the waters of Paradise are found beyond its boundaries,
yet its happiness is in Paradise alone. So, therefore, the baptism of the Church may exist
outside, but the gift of the life of happiness is found alone within the Church, which has
been founded on a rock, which has received the keys of binding and loosing.1335 "She it is
alone who holds as her privilege the whole power of her Bridegroom and Lord;"1336 by virtue
of which power as bride, she can bring forth sons even of handmaids. And these, if they be
not high-minded, shall be called into the lot of the inheritance; but if they be high-minded,
they shall remain outside.</p>

<p>2. All the more, then, because "we are fighting1337 for the honor and unity"
of the Church, let us beware of giving to heretics the credit of whatever we acknowledged
among them as belonging to the Church; but let us teach them by argument, that what they
possess that is derived from unity is of no efficacy to their salvation, unless they shall return
to that same unity. For "the water of the Church is full of faith, and salvation, and holiness"
1338 to those who use it rightly. No one, however, can use it well outside the Church.
But to those who use it perversely, whether within or without the Church, it is employed to
work punishment, and does not conduce to their reward. And so baptism "cannot be corrupted
and polluted," though it be handled by the corrupt or by adulterers, just as also "the
Church herself is uncorrupt, and pure, and chaste."1339 And so no share in it belongs to
the avaricious, or thieves, or usurers,—many of whom, by the testimony of Cyprian himself
in many places of his letters, exist not only without, but actually within the Church,—and
yet they both are baptized and do baptize, with no change in their hearts.</p>
<p>3. For this, too, he says, in one of his epistles1340 to the clergy on the subject of prayer
toGod, in which, after the fashion of the holy Daniel, he represents the sins of his people as
falling upon himself. For among many other evils of which he makes mention, he speaks
of them also as "renouncing the world in words only and not in deeds;" as the apostle says
of certain men, "They profess that they know God, but in works they deny Him."1341 These,
therefore, the blessed Cyprian shows to be contained within the Church herself, who are
baptized without their hearts being changed for the better, seeing that they renounce the
world in words and not in deeds, as the Apostle Peter says, "The like figure whereunto even
baptism doth also now save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer
of a good conscience),"1342 which certainly they had not of whom it is said that they "renounced
the world in words only, and not in deeds;" and yet he does his utmost, by chiding
and convincing them, to make them at length walk in the way of Christ, and be His friends
rather than friends of the world.</p>

<p>4. And if they would have obeyed him, and begun to live rightly, not as
false but as true Christians, would he have ordered them to be baptized anew? Surely not;
but their true conversion would have gained this for them, that the sacrament which availed
for their destruction while they were yet unchanged, should begin when they changed to
avail for their salvation.</p>
<p>5. For neither are they "devoted to the Church"1343 who seem to be within and live
contrary to Christ, that is, act against His commandments; nor can they be considered in
any way to belong to that Church, which He so purifies by the washing of water, "that He
may present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing."1344
But if they are not in that Church to whose members they do not belong, they are not in the
Church of which it is said, "My dove is but one; she is the only one of her mother;"1345 for
she herself is without spot or wrinkle. Or else let him who can assert that those are members
of this dove who renounce the world in words but not in deeds. Meantime there is one
thing which we see, from which I think it was said, "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it
unto the Lord,"1346 for God judgeth every day. For, according to His foreknowledge, who
knows whom He has foreordained before the foundation of the world to be made like to
the image of His Son, many who are even openly outside, and are called heretics, are better
than many good Catholics. For we see what they are to-day, what they shall be to-morrow
we know not. And with God, with whom the future is already present, they already are what
they shall hereafter be. But we, according to what each man is at present, inquire whether
they are to be to-day reckoned among the members of the Church which is called the one
dove, and the Bride of Christ without a spot or wrinkle,1347 of whom Cyprian says in the
letter which I have quoted above, that "they did not keep in the way of the Lord, nor observe
the commandments given unto them for their salvation; that they did not fulfill the will of
their Lord, being eager about their property and gains, following the dictates of pride, giving
way to envy and dissension, careless about single-mindedness and faith, renouncing the
world in words only and not in deeds, pleasing each himself, and displeasing all men."1348
But if the dove does not acknowledge them among her members, and if the Lord shall say
to them, supposing that they continue in the same perversity, "I never knew you: depart
from me, ye that work iniquity;"1349 then they seem indeed to be in the Church, but are not;

"nay, they even act against the Church. How then can they baptize with the baptism of the
Church,"1350 which is of avail neither to themselves, nor to those who receive it from them,
unless they are changed in heart with a true conversion, so that the sacrament itself, which
did not avail them when they received it whilst they were renouncing the world in words
and not in deeds, may begin to profit them when they shall begin to renounce it in deeds
also? And so too in the case of those whose separation from the Church is open; for neither
these nor those are as yet among the members of the dove, but some of them perhaps will
be at some future time.</p>

<p>6. We do not, therefore, "acknowledge the baptism of heretics,"1351 when
we refuse to baptize after them; but because we acknowledge the ordinance to be of Christ
even among evil men, whether openly separated from us, or secretly severed whilst within
our body, we receive it with due respect, having corrected those who were wrong in the
points wherein they went astray. However as I seem to be hard pressed when it is said to
me, "Does then a heretic confer remission of sins?" so I in turn press hard when I say, Does
then he who violates the commands of Heaven, the avaricious man, the robber, the usurer,
the envious man, does he who renounces the world in words and not in deeds, confer such
remission? If you mean by the force of God’s sacrament, then both the one and the other;
if by his own merit, neither of them. For that sacrament, even in the hands of wicked men,
is known to be of Christ; but neither the one nor the other of these men is found in the body
of the one uncorrupt, holy, chaste dove, which has neither spot nor wrinkle. And just as
baptism is of no profit to the man who renounces the world in words and not in deeds, so
it is of no profit to him who is baptized in heresy or schism; but each of them, when he
amends his ways, begins to receive profit from that which before was not profitable, but was
yet already in him.</p>
<p>7. "He therefore that is baptized in heresy does not become the temple of God;1352 but
does it therefore follow that he is not to be considered as baptized? For neither does the
avaricious man, baptized within the Church, become the temple of God unless he depart
from his avarice; for they who become the temple of God certainly inherit the kingdom of
God. But the apostle says, among many other things, "Neither the covetous, nor extortioners,
shall inherit the kingdom of God."1353 For in another place the same apostle compares
covetousness to the worship of idols: "Nor covetous man," he says, "who is an idolater;"1354
which meaning the same Cyprian has so far extended in a letter to Antonianus, that he did
not hesitate to compare the sin of covetousness with that of men who in time of persecution
had declared in writing that they would offer incense.1355 The man, then, who is baptized
in heresy in the name of the Holy Trinity, yet does not become the temple of God unless he
abandons his heresy, just as the covetous man who has been baptized in the same name
does not become the temple of God unless he abandons his covetousness, which is idolatry.
For this, too, the same apostle says: "What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?"1356
Let it not, then, be asked of us "of what God he is made the temple"1357 when we say that

he is not made the temple of God at all. Yet he is not therefore unbaptized, nor does his
foul error cause that what he has received, consecrated in the words of the gospel, should
not be the holy sacrament; just as the other man’s covetousness (which is idolatry) and great
uncleanness cannot prevent what he receives from being holy baptism, even though he be
baptized with the same words of the gospel by another man covetous like himself.</p>

<p>8. "Further," Cyprian goes on to say, "in vain do some, who are overcome
by reason, oppose to us custom, as though custom were superior to truth, or that were not
to be followed in spiritual things which has been revealed by the Holy Spirit, as the better
way."1358 This is clearly true, since reason and truth are to be preferred to custom. But
when truth supports custom, nothing should be more strongly maintained. Then he proceeds
as follows: "For one may pardon a man who merely errs, as the Apostle Paul says of himself,
‘Who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, because
I did it ignorantly;’1359 but he who, after inspiration and revelation given, perseveres advisedly
and knowingly in his former error, sins without hope of pardon on the ground of ignorance.
For he rests on a kind of presumption and obstinacy, when he is overcome by reason." This
is most true, that his sin is much more grievous who has sinned wittingly than his who has
sinned through ignorance. And so in the case of the holy Cyprian, who was not only learned,
but also patient of instruction, which he so fully himself understood to be a part of the praise
of the bishop whom the apostle describes,1360 that he said, "This also should be approved
in a bishop, that he not only teach with knowledge, but also learn with patience."1361 I do
not doubt that if he had had the opportunity of discussing this question, which has been so
long and so much disputed in the Church, with the pious and learned men to whom we
owe it that subsequently that ancient custom was confirmed by the authority of a plenary
Council, he would have shown, without hesitation, not only how learned he was in those
things which he had grasped with all the security of truth, but also how ready he was to receive
instruction in what he had failed to perceive. And yet, since it is so clear that it is much
more grievous to sin wittingly than in ignorance, I should be glad if any one would tell me
which is the worse,—the man who falls into heresy, not knowing how great a sin it is, or the
man who refuses to abandon his covetousness, knowing its enormity? I might even put the
question thus: If one man unwittingly fall into heresy, and another knowingly refuse to
depart from idolatry, since the apostle himself says, "The covetous man, which is an idolater;"
and Cyprian too understood the same passage in just the same way, when he says, in his
letter to Antonianus, "Nor let the new heretics flatter themselves in this, that they say they
do not communicate with idolaters, whereas there are amongst them both adulterers and
covetous persons, who are held guilty of the sin of idolatry; ‘for know this, and understand,
that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any
inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God;’1362 and again, ‘Mortify therefore your

concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry.’"1363 I ask, therefore, which sins more
deeply,—he who ignorantly has fallen into heresy, or he who wittingly has refused to abandon
covetousness, that is idolatry? According to that rule by which the sins of those who sin
wittingly are placed before those of the ignorant, the man who is covetous with knowledge
takes the first place in sin. But as it is possible that the greatness of the actual sin should
produce the same effect in the case of heresy that the witting commission of the sin produces
in that of covetousness, let us suppose the ignorant heretic to be on a par in guilt with the
consciously covetous man, although the evidence which Cyprian himself has advanced from
the apostle does not seem to prove this. For what is it that we abominate in heretics except
their blasphemies? But when he wished to show that ignorance of the sin may conduce to
ease in obtaining pardon, he advanced a proof from the case of the apostle, when he says,
"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, because
I did it ignorantly."1364 But if possible, as I said before, let the sins of the two men—the
blasphemy of the unconscious, and the idolatry of the conscious sinner—be esteemed of
equal weight; and let them be judged by the same sentence,—he who, in seeking for Christ,
falls into a truth-like setting forth of what is false, and he who wittingly resists Christ
speaking through His apostle, "seeing that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous
man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God,"1365—and then I would ask why baptism and the words of the gospel are held as naught
in the former case, and accounted valid in the latter, when each is alike found to be estranged
from the members of the dove. Is it because the former is an open combatant outside, that
he should not be admitted, the latter a cunning assenter within the fold, that he may not be
expelled?</p>

<p>9. But as regards his saying, "Nor let any one affirm that what they have
received from the apostles, that they follow; for the apostles handed down only one Church
and one baptism, and that appointed only in the same Church:"1366 this does not so much
move me to venture to condemn the baptism of Christ when found amongst heretics (just
as it is necessary to recognize the gospel itself when I find it with them, though I abominate
their error), as it warns me that there were some even in the times of the holy Cyprian who
traced to the authority of the apostles that custom against which the African Councils were
held, and in respect of which he himself said a little above, "In vain do those who are beaten
by reason oppose to us the authority of custom." Nor do I find the reason why the same
Cyprian found this very custom, which after his time was confirmed by nothing less than
a plenary Council of the whole world, already so strong before his time, that when with all
his learning he sought an authority worth following for changing it, he found nothing but
a Council of Agrippinus held in Africa a very few years before his own time. And seeing
that this was not enough for him, as against the custom of the whole world, he laid hold on
these reasons which we just now, considering them with great care, and being confirmed
by the antiquity of the custom itself, and by the subsequent authority of a plenary Council,
found to be truth-like rather than true; which, however, seemed to him true, as he toiled in
a question of the greatest obscurity, and was in doubt about the remission of sins,—whether
it could fail to be given in the baptism of Christ, and whether it could be given among
heretics. In which matter, if an imperfect revelation of the truth was given to Cyprian, that
the greatness of his love in not deserting the unity of the Church might be made manifest,
there is yet not any reason why any one should venture to claim superiority over the strong
defenses and excellence of his virtues, and the abundance of graces which were found in
him, merely because, with the instruction derived from the strength of a general Council,
he sees something which Cyprian did not see, because the Church had not yet held a plenary
Council on the matter. Just as no one is so insane as to set himself up as surpassing the
merits of the Apostle Peter, because, taught by the epistles of the Apostle Paul, and confirmed
by the custom of the Church herself, he does not compel the Gentiles to judaize, as Peter
once had done.1367</p>
<p>10. We do not then "find that any one, after being baptized among heretics, was afterwards
admitted by the apostles with the same baptism, and communicated;"1368 but neither
do we find this, that any one coming from the society of heretics, who had been baptized
among them, was baptized anew by the apostles. But this custom, which even then those
who looked back to past ages could not find to have been invented by men of a later time,

is rightly believed to have been handed down from the apostles. And there are many other
things of the same kind, which it would be tedious to recount. Wherefore, if they had
something to say for themselves to whom Cyprian, wishing to persuade them of the truth
of his own view, says, "Let no one say, What we have received from the apostles, that we
follow," with how much more force we now say, What the custom of the Church has always
held, what this argument has failed to prove false, and what a plenary Council has confirmed,
this we follow! To this we may add that it may also be said, after a careful inquiry into the
reasoning on both sides of the discussion, and into the evidence of Scripture, What truth
has declared, that we follow.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">

<p>11. For in fact, as to what some opposed to the reasoning of Cyprian, that
the apostle says, "Notwithstanding every way, whether in pretence or in truth, let Christ be
preached;"1369 Cyprian rightly exposed their error, showing that it has nothing to do with
the case of heretics, since the apostle was speaking of those who were acting within the
Church, with malicious envy seeking their own profit. They announced Christ, indeed,
according to the truth whereby we believe in Christ, but not in the spirit in which He was
announced by the good evangelists to the sons of the dove. "For Paul," he says, "in his epistle
was not speaking of heretics, or of their baptism, so that it could be shown that he had laid
down anything concerning this matter. He was speaking of brethren, whether as walking
disorderly and contrary to the discipline of the Church, or as keeping the discipline of the
Church in the fear of God. And he declared that some of them spoke the word of God
steadfastly and fearlessly, but that some were acting in envy and strife; that some had kept
themselves encompassed with kindly Christian love, but that others entertained malice and
strife: but yet that he patiently endured all things, with the view that, whether in truth or
in pretence, the name of Christ, which Paul preached, might come to the knowledge of the
greatest number, and that the sowing of the word, which was as yet a new and unaccustomed
work, might spread more widely by the preaching of those that spoke. Furthermore, it is
one thing for those who are within the Church to speak in the name of Christ, another thing
for those who are without, acting against the Church, to baptize in the name of Christ."1370
These words of Cyprian seem to warn us that we must distinguish between those who are
bad outside, and those who are bad within the Church. And those whom he says that the
apostle represents as preaching the gospel impurely and of envy, he says truly were within.
This much, however, I think I may say without rashness, if no one outside can have anything
which is of Christ, neither can any one within have anything which is of the devil. For if
that closed garden can contain the thorns of the devil, why cannot the fountain of Christ
equally flow beyond the garden’s bounds? But if it cannot contain them, whence, even in
the time of the Apostle Paul himself, did there arise amongst those who were within so great
an evil of envy and malicious strife? For these are the words of Cyprian. Can it be that envy
and malicious strife are a small evil? How then were those in unity who were not at peace?
For it is not my voice, nor that of any man, but of the Lord Himself; nor did the sound go
forth from men, but from angels, at the birth of Christ, "Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace to men of good will."1371 And this certainly would not have been proclaimed
by the voice of angels when Christ was born upon the earth, unless God wished this to be

understood, that those are in the unity of the body of Christ who are united in the peace of
Christ, and those are in the peace of Christ who are of good will. Furthermore, as good will
is shown in kindliness, so is bad will shown in malice.</p>

<p>12. In short, we may see how great an evil in itself is envy, which cannot
be other than malicious. Let us not look for other testimony. Cyprian himself is sufficient
for us, through whose mouth the Lord poured forth so many thunders in most perfect truth,
and uttered so many useful precepts about envy and malignity. Let us therefore read the
letter of Cyprian about envy and malignity, and see how great an evil it is to envy those
better than ourselves,—an evil whose origin he shows in memorable words to have sprung
from the devil himself. "To feel jealousy," he says, "of what you regard as good, and to envy
those who are better than yourselves, to some, dearest brethren, seems a light and minute
offense."1372 And again a little later, when he was inquiring into the source and origin of
the evil, he says, "From this the devil, in the very beginning of the world, perished first
himself, and led others to destruction."1373 And further on in the same chapter: "What an
evil, dearest brethren, is that by which an angel fell! by which that exalted and illustrious
loftiness was able to be deceived and overthrown! by which he was deceived who was the
deceiver! From that time envy stalks upon the earth, when man, about to perish through
malignity, submits himself to the teacher of perdition,—when he who envies imitates the
devil, as it is written, ‘Through envy of the devil came death into the world, and they that
do hold of his side do find it.’"1374 How true, how forcible are these words of Cyprian, in
an epistle known throughout the world, we cannot fail to recognize. It was truly fitting for
Cyprian to argue and warn most forcibly about envy and malignity, from which most deadly
evil he proved his own heart to be so far removed by the abundance of his Christian love;
by carefully guarding which he remained in the unity of communion with his colleagues,
who without ill-feeling entertained different views about baptism, whilst he himself differed
in opinion from them, not through any contention of ill will, but through human infirmity,
erring in a point which God, in His own good time, would reveal to him by reason of his
perseverance in love. For he says openly, "Judging no one, nor depriving any of the right
of communion if he differ from us. For no one of us setteth himself up as a bishop of bishops,
or by tyrannical terror forces his colleagues to a necessity of obeying." 1375 And in the end
of the epistle before us he says, "These things I have written to you briefly, dearest brother,
according to my poor ability, prescribing to or prejudging no one, so as to prevent each
bishop from doing what he thinks right in the free exercise of his own judgment. We, so
far as in us lies, do not strive on behalf of heretics with our colleges and fellow-bishops, with
whom we hold the harmony that God enjoins, and the peace of our Lord, especially as the
apostle says, ‘If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the

churches of God.’1376 Christian love in our souls, the honor of our fraternity, the bond of
faith, the harmony of the priesthood, all these are maintained by us with patience and gentleness.
For this cause we have also, so far as our poor ability admitted, by the permission
and inspiration of the Lord, written now a treatise on the benefit of patience,1377 which we
have sent to you in consideration of our mutual affection."1378</p>

<p>13. By this patience of Christian love he not only endured the difference
of opinion manifested in all kindliness by his good colleagues on an obscure point, as he
also himself received toleration, till, in process of time, when it so pleased God, what had
always been a most wholesome custom was further confirmed by a declaration of the truth
in a plenary Council, but he even put up with those who were manifestly bad, as was very
well known to himself, who did not entertain a different view in consequence of the obscurity
of the question, but acted contrary to their preaching in the evil practices of an abandoned
life, as the apostle says of them, "Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou
steal?"1379 For Cyprian says in his letter of such bishops of his own time, his own colleagues,
and remaining in communion with him, "While they had brethren starving in the Church,
they tried to amass large sums of money, they took possession of estates by fraudulent proceedings,
they multiplied their gains by accumulated usuries."1380 For here there is no obscure
question. Scripture declares openly, "Neither covetous nor extortioners shall inherit
the kingdom of God;"1381 and "He that putteth out his money to usury,"1382 and "No
whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance
in the kingdom of Christ and of God."1383 He therefore certainly would not, without
knowledge, have brought accusations of such covetousness, that men not only greedily
treasured up their own goods, but also fraudulently appropriated the goods of others, or of
idolatry existing in such enormity as he understands and proves it to exist; nor assuredly
would he bear false witness against his fellow-bishops. And yet with the bowels of fatherly
and motherly love he endured them, lest that, by rooting out the tares before their time, the
wheat should also have been rooted up,1384 imitating assuredly the Apostle Paul, who, with
the same love towards the Church, endured those who were ill-disposed and envious towards
him.1385</p>
<p>14. But yet because "by the envy of the devil death entered into the world, and they that
do hold of his side do find it,"1386 not because they are created by God, but because they go
astray of themselves, as Cyprian also says himself, seeing that the devil, before he was a
devil, was an angel, and good, how can it be that they who are of the devil’s side are in the
unity of Christ? Beyond all doubt, as the Lord Himself says, "an enemy hath done this,"

who "sowed tares among the wheat."1387 As therefore what is of the devil within the fold
must be convicted, so what is of Christ without must be recognized. Has the devil what is
his within the unity of the Church, and shall Christ not have what is His without? This,
perhaps, might be said of individual men, that as the devil has none that are his among the
holy angels, so God has none that are His outside the communion of the Church. But though
it may be allowed to the devil to mingle tares, that is, wicked men, with this Church which
still wears the mortal nature of flesh, so long as it is wandering far from God, he being allowed
this just because of the pilgrimage of the Church herself, that men may desire more ardently
the rest of that country which the angels enjoy, yet this cannot be said of the sacraments.
For, as the tares within the Church can have and handle them, though not for salvation, but
for the destruction to which they are destined in the fire, so also can the tares without, which
received them from seceders from within; for they did not lose them by seceding. This, indeed,
is made plain from the fact that baptism is not conferred again on their return, when
any of the very men who seceded happen to come back again. And let not any one say,
Why, what fruit hath the tares? For if this be so, their condition is the same, so far as this
goes, both inside and without. For it surely cannot be that grains of corn are found in the
tares inside, and not in those without. But when the question is of the sacrament, we do
not consider whether the tares bear any fruit, but whether they have any share of heaven;
for the tares, both within and without, share the rain with the wheat itself, which rain is in
itself heavenly and sweet, even though under its influence the tares grow up in barrenness.
And so the sacrament, according to the gospel of Christ, is divine and pleasant; nor is it to
be esteemed as naught because of the barrenness of those on whom its dew falls even without.</p>

<p>15. But some one may say that the tares within may more easily be converted
into wheat. I grant that it is so; but what has this to do with the question of repeating
baptism? You surely do not maintain that if a man converted from heresy, through the occasion
and opportunity given by his conversion, should bear fruit before another who, being
within the Church, is more slow to be washed from his iniquity, and so corrected and
changed, the former therefore needs not to be baptized again, but the churchman to be
baptized again, who was outstripped by him who came from the heretics, because of the
greater slowness of his amendment. It has nothing, therefore, to do with the question now
at issue who is later or slower in being converted from his especial waywardness to the
straight path of faith, or hope, or charity. For although the bad within the fold are more
easily made good yet it will sometimes happen that certain of the number of those outside
will outstrip in their conversion certain of those within; and while these remain in barrenness,
the former, being restored to unity and communion, will bear fruit with patience, thirtyfold,
or sixty-fold, or a hundred-fold.1388 Or if those only are to be called tares who remain
in perverse error to the end, there are many ears of corn outside, and many tares within.</p>
<p>16. But it will be urged that the bad outside are worse than those within. It is indeed a
weighty question, whether Nicolaus, being already severed from the Church,1389 or Simon,
who was still within it,1390 was the worse,—the one being a heretic, the other a sorcerer.
But if the mere fact of division, as being the clearest token of violated charity, is held to be
the worse evil, I grant that it is so. Yet many, though they have lost all feelings of charity,
yet do not secede from considerations of worldly profit; and as they seek their own, not the
things which are Jesus Christ’s,1391 what they are unwilling to secede from is not the unity
of Christ, but their own temporal advantage. Whence it is said in praise of charity, that she
"seeketh not her own."1392</p>
<p>17. Now, therefore, the question is, how could men of the party of the devil belong to
the Church, which has no spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,1393 of which also it is said,
"My dove is one?"1394 But if they cannot, it is clear that she groans among those who are
not of her, some treacherously laying wait within, some barking at her gate without. Such
men, however, even within, both receive baptism, and possess it, and transmit it holy in itself;
nor is it in any way defiled by their wickedness, in which they persevere even to the end.

Wherefore the same blessed Cyprian teaches us that baptism is to be considered as consecrated
in itself by the words of the gospel, as the Church has received, without joining to it
or mingling with it any consideration of waywardness and wickedness on the part of either
minister or recipients; since he himself points out to us both truths,—both that there have
been some within the Church who did not cherish kindly Christian love, but practised envy
and unkind dissension, of whom the Apostle Paul spoke; and also that the envious belong
to the devil’s party, as he testifies in the most open way in the epistle which he wrote about
envy and malignity. Wherefore, since it is clearly possible that in those who belong to the
devil’s party, Christ’s sacrament may yet be holy,—not, indeed, to their salvation, but to
their condemnation, and that not only if they are led astray after they have been baptized,
but even if they were such in heart when they received the sacrament, renouncing the world
(as the same Cyprian shows) in words only and not in deeds; 1395 and since even if afterwards
they be brought into the right way, the sacrament is not to be again administered which
they received when they were astray; so far as I can see, the case is already clear and evident,
that in the question of baptism we have to consider, not who gives, but what he gives; not
who receives, but what he receives; not who has, but what he has. For if men of the party
of the devil, and therefore in no way belonging to the one dove, can yet receive, and have,
and give baptism in all its holiness, in no way defiled by their waywardness, as we are taught
by the letters of Cyprian himself, how are we ascribing to heretics what does not belong to
them? how are we saying that what is really Christ’s is theirs, and not rather recognizing in
them the signs of our Sovereign, and correcting the deeds of deserters from Him? Wherefore
it is one thing, as the holy Cyprian says, "for those within in the Church, to speak in the
name of Christ, another thing for those without, who are acting against the Church, to
baptize in His name."1396 But both many who are within act against the Church by evil
living, and by enticing weak souls to copy their lives; and some who are without speak in
Christ’s name, and are not forbidden to work the works of Christ, but only to be without,
since for the healing of their souls we grasp at them, or reason with them, or exhort them.
For he, too, was without who did not follow Christ with His disciples, and yet in Christ’s
name was casting out devils, which the Lord enjoined that he should not be prevented from
doing;1397 although, certainly, in the point where he was imperfect he was to be made whole,
in accordance with the words of the Lord, in which He says, "He that is not with me is against
me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad."1398 Therefore both some things

<p>18. What shall we say of what is also wonderful, that he who carefully
observes may find that it is possible that certain persons, without violating Christian charity,
may yet teach what is useless, as Peter wished to compel the Gentiles to observe Jewish
customs,1399 as Cyprian himself would force heretics to be baptized anew? whence the
apostle says to such good members, who are rooted in charity, and yet walk not rightly in
some points, "If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you;"1400
and that some again, though devoid of charity, may teach something wholesome? of whom
the Lord says, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat: all therefore whatsoever
they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say and
do not."1401 Whence the apostle also says of those envious and malicious ones who yet
preach salvation through Christ, "Whether in pretense, or in truth, let Christ be
preached."1402 Wherefore, both within and without, the waywardness of man is to be corrected,
but the divine sacraments and utterances are not to be attributed to men. He is not,
therefore, a "patron of heretics" who refuses to attribute to them what he knows not to belong
to them, even though it be found among them. We do not grant baptism to be theirs; but
we recognize His baptism of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizeth,"1403
wheresoever we find it. But if "the treacherous and blasphemous man" continue in his
treachery and blasphemy, he receives no "remission of sins either without" or within the
Church; or if, by the power of the sacrament, he receives it for the moment, the same force
operates both without and within, as the power of the name of Christ used to work the expulsion
of devils even without the Church.</p>

<p>19. But he urges that "we find that the apostles, in all their epistles, execrated
and abhorred the sacrilegious wickedness of heretics, so as to say that ‘their word does
spread as a canker.’"1404 What then? Does not Paul also show that those who said, "Let us
eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," were corrupters of good manners by their evil communications,
adding immediately afterwards, "Evil communications corrupt good manners;"
and yet he intimated that these were within the Church when he says, "How say some among
you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"1405 But when does he fail to express his abhorrence
of the covetous? Or could anything be said in stronger terms, than that covetousness
should be called idolatry, as the same apostle declared?1406 Nor did Cyprian understand
his language otherwise, inserting it when need required in his letters; though he confesses
that in his time there were in the Church not covetous men of an ordinary type, but robbers
and usurers, and these found not among the masses, but among the bishops. And yet I
should be willing to understand that those of whom the apostle says, "Their word does
spread as a canker," were without the Church, but Cyprian himself will not allow me. For,
when showing, in his letter to Antonianus,1407 that no man ought to sever himself from the
unity of the Church before the time of the final separation of the just and unjust, merely
because of the admixture of evil men in the Church, when he makes it manifest how holy
he was, and deserving of the illustrious martyrdom which he won, he says, "What swelling
of arrogance it is, what forgetfulness of humility and gentleness, that any one should dare
or believe that he can do what the Lord did not grant even to the apostles,—to think that
he can distinguish the tares from the wheat, or, as if it were granted to him to carry the fan
and purge the floor, to endeavor to separate the chaff from the grain! And whereas the
apostle says, ‘But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of
wood and of earth,’1408 that he should seem to choose those of gold and of silver, and despise
and cast away and condemn those of wood and of earth, when really the vessels of wood
are only to be burned in the day of the Lord by the burning of the divine conflagration, and
those of earth are to be broken by Him to whom the ‘rod of iron1409 has been given.’"1410

By this argument, therefore, against those who, under the pretext of avoiding the society of
wicked men, had severed themselves from the unity of the Church, Cyprian shows that by
the great house of which the apostle spoke, in which there were not only vessels of gold and
of silver, but also of wood and of earth, he understood nothing else but the Church, in which
there should be good and bad, till at the last day it should be cleansed as a threshing-floor
by the winnowing-fan. And if this be so, in the Church herself, that is, in the great house
itself, there were vessels to dishonor, whose word did spread like a canker. For the apostle,
speaking of them, taught as follows: "And their word," he says, "will spread as doth a canker;
of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the
resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation
of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let every
one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are
not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth."1411 If, therefore, they
whose words did spread as doth a canker were as it were vessels to dishonor in the great
house, and by that "great house" Cyprian understands the unity of the Church itself, surely
it cannot be that their canker polluted the baptism of Christ. Accordingly, neither without,
any more than within, can any one who is of the devil’s party, either in himself or in any
other person, stain the sacrament which is of Christ. It is not, therefore, the case that "the
word which spreads as a canker to the ears of those who hear it gives remission of sins;"1412
but when baptism is given in the words of the gospel, however great be the perverseness of
understanding on the part either of him through whom, or of him to whom it is given, the
sacrament itself is holy in itself on account of Him whose sacrament it is. And if any one,
receiving it at the hands of a misguided man, yet does not receive the perversity of the
minister, but only the holiness of the mystery, being closely bound to the unity of the Church
in good faith and hope and charity, he receives remission of his sins,—not by the words
which do eat as doth a canker, but by the sacraments of the gospel flowing from a heavenly
source. But if the recipient himself be misguided, on the one hand, what is given is of no
avail for the salvation of the misguided man; and yet, on the other hand, that which is received
remains holy in the recipient, and is not renewed to him if he be brought to the right way.</p>

<p>20. There is therefore "no fellowship between righteousness and unrighteousness,"
1413 not only without, but also within the Church; for "the Lord knoweth them
that are His," and "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
There is also "no communion between light and darkness,"1414 not only without, but also
within the Church; for "he that hateth his brother is still in darkness."1415 And they at any
rate hated Paul, who, preaching Christ of envy and malicious strife, supposed that they added
affliction to his bonds;1416 and yet the same Cyprian understands these still to have been
within the Church. Since, therefore, "neither darkness can enlighten, nor unrighteousness
justify,"1417 as Cyprian again says, I ask, how could those men baptize within the very Church
herself? I ask, how could those vessels which the large house contains not to honor, but to
dishonor, administer what is holy for the sanctifying of men within the great house itself,
unless because that holiness of the sacrament cannot be polluted even by the unclean, either
when it is given at their hands, or when it is received by those who in heart and life are not
changed for the better? of whom, as situated within the Church, Cyprian himself says, "Renouncing
the world in word only, and not in deed."1418</p>
<p>21. There are therefore also within the Church "enemies of God, whose hearts the
spirit of Antichrist has possessed;" and yet they, "deal with spiritual and divine things,"1419
which cannot profit for their salvation so long as they remain such as they are; and yet
neither can they pollute them by their own uncleanness. With regard to what he says,
therefore, "that they have no part given them in the saving grace of the Church, who, scattering
and fighting against the Church of Christ, are called adversaries by Christ Himself,
and antichrists by His apostles,1420 this must be received under the consideration that there
are men of this kind both within and without. But the separation of those that are within
from the perfection and unity of the dove is not only known in the case of some men to
God, but even in the case of some to their fellow-men; for, by regarding their openly abandoned
life and confirmed wickedness, and comparing it with the rules of God’s commandments,
they understand to what a multitude of tares and chaff, situated now some within
and some without, but destined to be most manifestly separated at the last day, the Lord

<p>22. But we must not despair of the conversion of any man, whether situated
within or without, so long as "the goodness of God leadeth him to repentance,"1423 and
"visits their transgressions with the rod, and their inquiry with stripes." For in this way "He
does not utterly take from them His loving-kindness,"1424 if they will themselves sometimes
"love their own soul, pleasing God."1425 But as the good man "that shall endure unto the
end, the same shall be saved,"1426 so the bad man, whether within or without, who shall
persevere in his wickedness to the end, shall not be saved. Nor do we say that "all,
wheresoever and howsoever baptized, obtain the grace of baptism,"1427 if by the grace of
baptism is understood the actual salvation which is conferred by the celebration of the sacrament;
but many fail to obtain this salvation even within the Church, although it is clear
that they possess the sacrament, which is holy in itself. Well, therefore, does the Lord warn
us in the gospel that we should not company with ill-advisers,1428 who walk under the pretence
of Christ’s name; but these are found both within and without, as, in fact, they do not
proceed without unless they have first been ill-disposed within. And we know that the
apostle said of the vessels placed in the great house, "If a man therefore purge himself from
these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the Master’s use, and prepared
unto every good work."1429 But in what manner each man ought to purge himself from
these he shows a little above, saying, "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart
from iniquity,"1430 that he may not in the last day, with the chaff, whether with that which
has already been driven from the threshing-floor, or with that which is to be separated at
the last, hear the command, "Depart from me, ye that work iniquity."1431 Whence it appears,
indeed, as Cyprian says, that "we are not at once to admit and adopt whatsoever is professed
in the name of Christ, but only what is done in the truth of Christ."1432 But it is not an action
done in the truth of Christ that men should "seize on estates by fraudulent pretenses, and
increase their gains by accumulated usury,"1433 or that they should "renounce the world in

<p>23. To go on to the point which he pursues at great length, that "they who
blaspheme the Father of Christ cannot be baptized in Christ,"1435 since it is clear that they
blaspheme through error (for he who comes to the baptism of Christ will not openly blaspheme
the Father of Christ, but he is led to blaspheme by holding a view contrary to the
teaching of the truth about the Father of Christ), we have already shown at sufficient length
that baptism, consecrated in the words of the gospel, is not affected by the error of any man,
whether ministrant or recipient, whether he hold views contrary to the revelation of divine
teaching on the subject of the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghost. For many carnal and
natural men are baptized even within the Church, as the apostle expressly says: "The natural
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God;"1436 and after they had received baptism,
he says that they "are yet carnal."1437 But according to it carnal sense, a soul given up to
fleshly appetites cannot entertain but fleshly wisdom about God. Wherefore many, progressing
after baptism, and especially those who have been baptized in infancy or early youth, in
proportion as their intellect becomes clearer and brighter, while "the inward man is renewed
day by day,"1438 throw away their former opinions which they held about God while they
were mocked with vain imaginings, with scorn and horror and confession of their mistake.
And yet they are not therefore considered not to have received baptism, or to have received
baptism of a kind corresponding to their error; but in them both the perfection of the sacrament
is honored and the delusion of their mind is corrected, even though it had become
inveterate through long confirmation, or been, perhaps, maintained in many controversies.
Wherefore even the heretic, who is manifestly without, if he has there received baptism as
ordained in the gospel, has certainly not received baptism of a kind corresponding to the
error which blinds him. And therefore, in returning into the way of wisdom he perceives
that he ought to relinquish what he has held amiss, he must not at the same time give up
the good which he had received; nor because his error is to be condemned, is the baptism
of Christ in him to be therefore extinguished. For it is already sufficiently clear, from the
case of those who happen to be baptized within the Church with false views about God, that
the truth of the sacrament is to be distinguished from the error of him who believes amiss,
although both may be found in the same man. And therefore, when any one grounded in
any error, even outside the Church, has yet been baptized with the true sacrament, when
he is restored to the unity of the Church, a true baptism cannot take the place of a true
baptism, as a true faith takes the place of a false one, because a thing cannot take the place
of itself, since neither can it give place. Heretics therefore join the Catholic Church to this

end, that what they have evil of themselves may be corrected, not that what they have good
of God should be repeated.</p>

<p>24. Some one says, Does it then make no difference, if two men, rooted
in like error and wickedness, be baptized without change of life or heart, one without, the
other within the Church? I acknowledge that there is a difference. For he is worse who is
baptized without, in addition to his other sin,—not because of his baptism, however, but
because he is without; for the evil of division is in itself far from insignificant or trivial. Yet
the difference exists only if he who is baptized within has desired to be within not for the
sake of any earthly or temporal advantage, but because he has preferred the unity of the
Church spread throughout the world to the divisions of schism; otherwise he too must be
considered among those who are without. Let us therefore put the two cases in this way.
Let us suppose that the one, for the sake of argument, held the same opinions as Photinus
1439 about Christ, and was baptized in his heresy outside the communion of the Catholic
Church; and that another held the same opinion but was baptized in the Catholic Church,
believing that his view was really the Catholic faith. I consider him as not yet a heretic, unless,
when the doctrine of the Catholic faith is made clear to him, he chooses to resist it, and
prefers that which he already holds; and till this is the case, it is clear that he who was baptized
outside is the worse. And so in the one case erroneous opinion alone, in the other the sin
of schism also, requires correction; but in neither of them is the truth of the sacrament to
be repeated. But if any one holds the same view as the first, and knows that it is only in
heresy severed from the Church that such a view is taught or learned, but yet for the sake
of some temporal emolument has desired to be baptized in the Catholic unity, or, having
been already baptized in it, is unwilling on account of the said emolument to secede from
it, he is not only to be considered as seceding, but his offense is aggravated, in so far as to
the error of heresy and the division of unity he adds the deceit of hypocrisy. Wherefore the
depravity of each man, in proportion as it is more dangerous and wanting in straightforwardness,
must be corrected with the more earnestness and energy; and yet, if he has anything
that is good in him, especially if it be not of himself, but from God, we ought not to think
it of no value because of his depravity, or to be blamed like it, or to be ascribed to it, rather
than to His bountiful goodness, who even to a soul that plays the harlot, and goes after her
lovers, yet gives His bread, and His wine, and His oil, and other food or ornaments, which
are neither from herself nor from her lovers, but from Him who in compassion for her is
even desirous to warn her to whom she should return.1440</p>

<p>25. "Can the power of baptism," says Cyprian, "be greater or better than
confession? than martyrdom? that a man should confess Christ before men, and be baptized
in his own blood? And yet," he goes on to say, "neither does this baptism profit the heretic,
even though for confessing Christ he be put to death outside the Church."1441 This is most
true; for, by being put to death outside the Church, he is proved not to have had charity, of
which the apostle says, "Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
profiteth me nothing."1442 But if martyrdom is of no avail for this reason, because it has
not charity, neither does it profit those who, as Paul says, and Cyprian further sets forth,
are living within the Church without charity in envy and malice; and yet they can both receive
and transmit true baptism. "Salvation," he says, "is not without the Church."1443 Who says
that it is? And therefore, whatever men have that belongs to the Church, it profits them
nothing towards salvation outside the Church. But it is one thing not to have, another to
have so as to be of no use. He who has not must be baptized that he may have; but he who
has to no avail must be corrected, that what he has may profit him. Nor is the water in the
baptism of heretics "adulterous,"1444 because neither is the creature itself which God made
evil, nor is fault to be found with the words of the gospel in the mouths of any who are
astray; but the fault is theirs in whom there is an adulterous spirit, even though it may receive
the adornment of the sacrament from a lawful spouse. Baptism therefore can "be common
to us, and the heretics,"1445 just as the gospel can be common to us, whatever difference
there may be between our faith and their error,—whether they think otherwise than the
truth about the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit; or, being cut away from unity, do not
gather with Christ, but scatter abroad,1446—seeing that the sacrament of baptism can be
common to us, if we are the wheat of the Lord, with the covetous within the Church, and
with robbers, and drunkards, and other pestilent persons of the same sort, of whom it is
said, "They shall not inherit the kingdom of God,"1447 and yet the vices by which they are
separated from the kingdom of God are not shared by us.</p>

<p>26. Nor indeed, is it of heresies alone that the apostle says "that they which
do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." But it may be worth while to look
for a moment at the things which he groups together. "The works of the flesh," he says "are
manifest, which are these; fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness,
revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."1448 Let us suppose
some one, therefore, chaste, continent, free from covetousness, no idolater, hospitable,
charitable to the needy, no man’s enemy, not contentious, patient, quiet, jealous of none,
envying none, sober, frugal, but a heretic; it is of course clear to all that for this one fault
only, that he is a heretic, he will fail to inherit the kingdom of God. Let us suppose another,
a fornicator, unclean, lascivious, covetous, or even more openly given to idolatry, a student
of witchcraft, a lover of strife and contention, envious, hot-tempered, seditious, jealous,
drunken, and a reveller, but a Catholic; can it be that for this sole merit, that he is a Catholic,
he will inherit the kingdom of God, though his deeds are of the kind of which the apostle
thus concludes: "Of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that
they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" If we say this, we lead
ourselves astray. For the word of God does not lead us astray, which is neither silent, nor
lenient, nor deceptive through any flattery. Indeed, it speaks to the same effect elsewhere:
"For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is
an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive
you with vain words."1449 We have no reason, therefore, to complain of the word of God.
It certainly says, and says openly and freely, that those who live a wicked life have no part
in the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>27. Let us therefore not flatter the Catholic who is hemmed in with all
these vices, nor venture, merely because he is a Catholic Christian, to promise him the im-
punity which holy Scripture does not promise him; nor, if he has any one of the faults above
mentioned, ought we to promise him a partnership in that heavenly land. For, in writing
to the Corinthians, the apostle enumerates the several sins, under each of which it is implicitly
understood that it shall not inherit the kingdom of God: "Be not deceived," he says: "neither
fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit
the kingdom of God."1450 He does not say, those who possess all these vices together
shall not inherit the kingdom of God; but neither these nor those: so that, as each is named,
you may understand that no one of them shall inherit the kingdom of God. As, therefore,
heretics shall not possess the kingdom of God, so the covetous shall not inherit the kingdom
of God. Nor can we indeed doubt that the punishments themselves, with which they shall
be tortured who do not inherit the kingdom of God, will vary in proportion to the difference
of their offences, and that some will be more severe than others; so that in the eternal fire
itself there will be different tortures in the punishments, corresponding to the different
weights of guilt. For indeed it was not idly that the Lord said, "It shall be more tolerable for
the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee."1451 But yet, so far as failing to
inherit the kingdom of God is concerned, it is just as certain, if you choose any one of the
less heinous of these vices, as if you choose more than one, or some one which you saw was
more atrocious; and because those will inherit the kingdom of God whom the Judge shall
set on His right hand, and for those who shall not be found worthy to be set at the right
hand nothing will remain but to be at the left, no other announcement is left for them to
hear like goats from the mouth of the Shepherd, except, "Depart into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels;"1452 though in that fire, as I said before, it may be that different
punishments will be awarded corresponding to the difference of the sins.</p>

<p>28. But on the question whether we ought to prefer a Catholic of the most
abandoned character to a heretic in whose life, except that he is a heretic, men can find
nothing to blame, I do not venture to give a hasty judgment. But if any one says, because
he is a heretic, he cannot be this only without other vices also following,—for he is carnal
and natural, and therefore must be also envious, and hot-tempered, and jealous, and hostile
to truth itself, and utterly estranged from it,—let him fairly understand, that of those other
faults of which he is supposed to have chosen some one less flagrant, a single one cannot
exist by itself in any man, because he in turn is carnal and natural; as, to take the case of
drunkenness, which people have now become accustomed to talk of not only without horror,
but with some degree of merriment, can it possibly exist alone in any one in whom it is
found? For what drunkard is not also contentious, and hot-tempered, and jealous, and at
variance with all soundness of counsel, and at grievous enmity with those who rebuke him?
Further, it is not easy for him to avoid being a fornicator and adulterer, though he may be
no heretic; just as a heretic may be no drunkard, nor adulterer, nor fornicator, nor lascivious,
nor a lover of money, or given to witchcraft, and cannot well be all these together. Nor indeed
is any one vice followed by all the rest. Supposing, therefore, two men,—one a Catholic
with all these vices, the other a heretic free from all from which a heretic can be free,—although
they do not both contend against the faith, and yet each lives contrary to the faith,
and each is deceived by a vain hope, and each is far removed from charity of spirit, and
therefore each is severed from connection with the body of the one dove; why do we recognise
in one of them the sacrament of Christ, and not in the other, as though it belonged to this
or that man, whilst really it is the same in both, and belongs to God alone, and is good even
in the worst of men? And if of the men who have it, one is worse than another, it does not
follow that the sacrament which they have is worse in the one than in the other, seeing that
neither in the case of two bad Catholics, if one be worse than the other, does he possess a
worse baptism, nor, if one of them be good and another bad, is baptism bad in the bad one
and good in the good one; but it is good in both. Just as the light of the sun, or even of a
lamp, is certainly not less brilliant when displayed to bad eyes than when seen by better
ones; but it is the same in the case of both, although it either cheers or hurts them differently
according to the difference of their powers.</p>

<p>29. With regard to the objection brought against Cyprian, that the catechumens
who were seized in martyrdom, and slain for Christ’s name’s sake, received a
crown even without baptism, I do not quite see what it has to do with the matter, unless,
indeed, they urged that heretics could much more be admitted with baptism to Christ’s
kingdom, to which catechumens were admitted without it, since He Himself has said, "Except
a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."1453
Now, in this matter I do not hesitate for a moment to place the Catholic catechumen, who
is burning with love for God, before the baptized heretic; nor yet do we thereby do dishonor
to the sacrament of baptism which the latter has already received, the former not as yet; nor
do we consider that the sacrament of the catechumen1454 is to be preferred to the sacrament
of baptism, when we acknowledge that some catechumens are better and more faithful than
some baptized persons. For the centurion Cornelius, before baptism, was better than Simon,
who had been baptized. For Cornelius, even before his baptism, was filled with the Holy
Spirit;1455 Simon, even after baptism, was puffed up with an unclean spirit.1456 Cornelius,
however, would have been convicted of contempt for so holy a sacrament, if, even after he
had received the Holy Ghost, he had refused to be baptized. But when he was baptized, he
received in no wise a better sacrament than Simon; but the different merits of the men were
made manifest under the equal holiness of the same sacrament—so true is it that the good
or ill deserving of the recipient does not increase or diminish the holiness of baptism. But
as baptism is wanting to a good catechumen to his receiving the kingdom of heaven, so true
conversion is wanting to a bad man though baptized. For He who said, "Except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God," said also Himself,
"except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."1457 For that the righteousness of the
catechumens might not feel secure, it is written, "Except a man be born again of water and
of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." And again, that the unrighteousness

This does not suit the sense of the passage, and probably sprung from want of knowledge of the meaning of the

of the baptized might not feel secure because they had received baptism, it is written, "Except
your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in
no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." The one were too little without the other; the
two make perfect the heir of that inheritance. As, then, we ought not to depreciate a man’s
righteousness, which begins to exist before he is joined to the Church, as the righteousness
of Cornelius began to exist before he was in the body of Christian men,—which righteousness
was not thought worthless, or the angel would not have said to him, "Thy prayers and thine
alms are come up as a memorial before God;" nor did it yet suffice for his obtaining the
kingdom of heaven, or he would not have been told to send to Peter,1458—so neither ought
we to depreciate the sacrament of baptism, even though it has been received outside the
Church. But since it is of no avail for salvation unless he who has baptism indeed in full
perfection be incorporated into the Church, correcting also his own depravity, let us therefore
correct the error of the heretics, that we may recognize what in them is not their own but
Christ’s.</p>

<p>30. That the place of baptism is sometimes supplied by martyrdom is
supported by an argument by no means trivial, which the blessed Cyprian adduces1459 from
the thief, to whom, though he was not baptized, it was yet said, "To-day shall thou be with
me in Paradise."1460 On considering which, again and again, I find that not only martyrdom
for the sake of Christ may supply what was wanting of baptism, but also faith and conversion
of heart, if recourse may not be had to the celebration of the mystery of baptism for want
of time.1461 For neither was that thief crucified for the name of Christ, but as the reward
of his own deeds; nor did he suffer because he believed, but he believed while suffering. It
was shown, therefore, in the case of that thief, how great is the power, even without the
visible sacrament of baptism, of what the apostle says, "With the heart man believeth unto
righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."1462 But the want is
supplied invisibly only when the administration of baptism is prevented, not by contempt
for religion, but by the necessity of the moment. For much more in the case of Cornelius
and his friends, than in the case of that robber, might it seem superfluous that they should
also be baptized with water, seeing that in them the gift of the Holy Spirit, which, according
to the testimony of holy Scripture, was received by other men only after baptism, had made
itself manifest by every unmistakable sign appropriate to those times when they spoke with
tongues. Yet they were baptized, and for this action we have the authority of an apostle as
the warrant. So far ought all of us to be from being induced by any imperfection in the inner
man, if it so happen that before baptism a person has advanced, through the workings of a
pious heart, to spiritual understanding, to despise a sacrament which is applied to the body
by the hands of the minister, but which is God’s own means for working spiritually a man’s
dedication to Himself. Nor do I conceive that the function of baptizing was assigned to
John, so that it should be called John’s baptism, for any other reason except that the Lord
Himself, who had appointed it, in not disdaining to receive the baptism of His servant,1463
might consecrate the path of humility, and show most plainly by such an action how high
a value was to be placed on His own baptism, with which He Himself was afterwards to
baptize. For He saw, like an excellent physician of eternal salvation, that overweening pride
would be found in some, who, having made such progress in the understanding of the truth
and in uprightness of character that they would not hesitate to place themselves, both in
life and knowledge, above many that were baptized, would think it was unnecessary for

that were baptized were still only endeavoring to raise themselves. </p>

<p>31. But what is the precise value of the sanctification of the sacrament
(which that thief did not receive, not from any want of will on his part, but because it was
unavoidably omitted) and what is the effect on a man of its material application, it is not
easy to say. Still, had it not been of the greatest value, the Lord would not have received the
baptism of a servant. But since we must look at it in itself, without entering upon the
question of the salvation of the recipient, which it is intended to work, it shows clearly
enough that both in the bad, and in those who renounce the world in word and not in deed,
it is itself complete, though they cannot receive salvation unless they amend their lives. But
as in the thief, to whom the material administration of the sacrament was necessarily
wanting, the salvation was complete, because it was spiritually present through his piety,
so, when the sacrament itself is present, salvation is complete, if what the thief possessed be
unavoidably wanting. And this is the firm tradition of the universal Church, in respect of
the baptism of infants, who certainly are as yet unable "with the heart to believe unto righteousness,
and with the mouth to make confession unto salvation," as the thief could do; nay,
who even, by crying and moaning when the mystery is performed upon them, raise their
voices in opposition to the mysterious words, and yet no Christian will say that they are
baptized to no purpose.</p>

<p>32. And if any one seek for divine authority in this matter, though what
is held by the whole Church, and that not as instituted by Councils, but as a matter of invariable
custom, is rightly held to have been handed down by apostolical authority, still we can
form a true conjecture of the value of the sacrament of baptism in the case of infants, from
the parallel of circumcision, which was received by God’s earlier people, and before receiving
which Abraham was justified, as Cornelius also was enriched with the gift of the Holy
Spirit before he was baptized. Yet the apostle says of Abraham himself, that "he received
the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith," having already believed in
his heart, so that "it was counted unto him for righteousness."1464 Why, therefore, was it
commanded him that he should circumcise every male child in order on the eighth day,1465
though it could not yet believe with the heart, that it should be counted unto it for righteousness,
because the sacrament in itself was of great avail? And this was made manifest by the
message of an angel in the case of Moses’ son; for when he was carried by his mother, being
yet uncircumcised, it was required, by manifest present peril, that he should be circumcised,
1466 and when this was done, the danger of death was removed. As therefore in Abraham
the justification of faith came first, and circumcision was added afterwards as the seal
of faith; so in Cornelius the spiritual sanctification came first in the gift of the Holy Spirit,
and the sacrament of regeneration was added afterwards in the laver of baptism. And as in
Isaac, who was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, the seal of this righteousness
of faith was given first, and afterwards, as he imitated the faith of his father, the righteousness
itself followed as he grew up, of which the seal had been given before when he was an infant;
so in infants, who are baptized, the sacrament of regeneration is given first, and if they
maintain a Christian piety, conversion also in the heart will follow, of which the mysterious
sign had gone before in the outward body. And as in the thief the gracious goodness of the
Almighty supplied what had been wanting in the sacrament of baptism, because it had been
missing not from pride or contempt, but from want of opportunity; so in infants who die
baptized, we must believe that the same grace of the Almighty supplies the want, that, not
from perversity of will, but from insufficiency of age, they can neither believe with the heart
unto righteousness, nor make confession with the mouth unto salvation. Therefore, when
others take the vows for them, that the celebration of the sacrament may be complete in
their behalf, it is unquestionably of avail for their dedication to God, because they cannot
answer for themselves. But if another were to answer for one who could answer for himself,
it would not be of the same avail. In accordance with which rule, we find in the gospel what
strikes every one as natural when he reads it, "He is of age, he shall speak for himself."1467</p>

<p>33. By all these considerations it is proved that the sacrament of baptism
is one thing, the conversion of the heart another; but that man’s salvation is made complete
through the two together. Nor are we to suppose that, if one of these be wanting, it necessarily
follows that the other is wanting also; because the sacrament may exist in the infant
without the conversion of the heart; and this was found to be possible without the sacrament
in the case of the thief, God in either case filling up what was involuntarily wanting. But
when either of these requisites is wanting intentionally, then the man is responsible for the
omission. And baptism may exist when the conversion of the heart is wanting; but, with
respect to such conversion, it may indeed be found when baptism has not been received,
but never when it has been despised. Nor can there be said in any way to be a turning of
the heart to God when the sacrament of God is treated with contempt. Therefore we are
right in censuring, anathematizing, abhorring, and abominating the perversity of heart
shown by heretics; yet it does not follow that they have not the sacrament of the gospel, because
they have not what makes it of avail. Wherefore, when they come to the true faith,
and by penitence seek remission of their sins, we are not flattering or deceiving them, when
we instruct them by heavenly discipline for the kingdom of heaven, correcting and reforming
in them their errors and perverseness, to the intent that we may by no means do violence
to what is sound in them, nor, because of man’s fault, declare that anything which he may
have in him from God is either valueless or faulty.</p>

since these will raise the question both of the past custom of the Church and of the baptism
of John, which is wont to excite no small doubt in those who pay slight attention to a matter
which is sufficiently obvious, seeing that those who had received the baptism of John were

<p>1. We have the testimony of the blessed Cyprian, that the custom of the
Catholic Church is at present retained, when men coming from the side of heretics or
schismatics, if they have received baptism as consecrated in the words of the gospel, are not
baptized afresh. For he himself proposed to himself the question, and that as coming from
the mouth of brethren either seeking the truth or contending for the truth. For in the course
of the arguments by which he wished to show that heretics should be baptized again, which
we have sufficiently considered for our present purpose in the former books, he says: "But
some will say, What then will become of those who in times past, coming to the Church
from heresy, were admitted without baptism?"1469 In this question is involved the shipwreck
of the whole cause of the Donatists, with whom our contest is on this point. For if those
had not really baptism who were thus received on coming from heretics, and their sins were
still upon them, then, when such men were admitted to communion, either by those who
came before Cyprian or by Cyprian himself, we must acknowledge that one of two things
occurred,—either that the Church perished then and there from the pollution of communion
with such men, or that any one abiding in unity is not injured by even the notorious sins of
other men. But since they cannot say that the Church then perished through the contamination
arising from communion with those who, as Cyprian says, were admitted into it
without baptism—for otherwise they cannot maintain the validity of their own origin if the
Church then perished, seeing that the list of consuls proves that more than forty years elapsed
between the martyrdom of Cyprian and the burning of the sacred books,1470 from which
they took occasion to make a schism, spreading abroad the smoke of their calumnies,—it
therefore is left for them to acknowledge that the unity of Christ is not polluted by any such
communion, even with known offenders. And, after this confession, they will be unable to
discover any reason which will justify them in maintaining that they were bound to separate
from the churches of the whole world, which, as we read, were equally founded by the
apostles, seeing that, while the others could not have perished from any admixture of offenders,
of whatsoever kind, they, though they would not have perished if they had remained in
unity with them, brought destruction on themselves in schism, by separating themselves
from their brethren, and breaking the bond of peace. For the sacrilege of schism is most
clearly evident in them, if they had no sufficient cause for separation. And it is clear that
there was no sufficient cause for separation, if even the presence of notorious offenders
cannot pollute the good while they abide in unity. But that the good, abiding in unity, are
not polluted even by notorious offenders, we teach on the testimony of Cyprian, who says
that "men in past times, coming to the Church from heresy, were admitted without baptism;"
and yet, if the wickedness of their sacrilege, which was still upon them, seeing it had not

<pb n="829"/>
been purged away by baptism, could not pollute and destroy the holiness of the Church, it
cannot perish by any infection from wicked men. Wherefore, if they allow that Cyprian
spoke the truth, they are convicted of schism on his testimony; if they maintain that he does
not speak truth, let them not use his testimony on the question of baptism.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="830"/>
<head>Chapter 2.</head>
<p>2. But now that we have begun a disputation with a man of peace like
Cyprian, let us go on. For when he had brought an objection against himself, which he
knew was urged by his brethren, "What then will become of those who in times past, coming
to the Church from heresy, were admitted without baptism? The Lord," he answers, "is able
of His mercy to grant indulgence, and not to separate from the gifts of His Church those
who, being admitted in all honesty to His Church, have fallen asleep within the Church."1471
Well indeed has he assumed that charity can cover the multitude of sins. But if they really
had baptism, and this were not rightly perceived by those who thought that they should be
baptized again, that error was covered by the charity of unity so long as it contained, not
the discord and spirit of the devil, but merely human infirmity, until, as the apostle says, "if
they were otherwise minded, the Lord should reveal it to them."1472 But woe unto those
who, being torn asunder from unity by a sacrilegious rupture, either rebaptize, if baptism
exists with both us and them, or do not baptize at all, if baptism exist in the Catholic Church
only. Whether, therefore, they rebaptize, or fail to baptize, they are not in the bond of peace;
wherefore let them apply a remedy to which they please of these two wounds. But if we
admit to the Church without baptism, we are of the number of those who, as Cyprian has
assumed, may receive pardon because they preserved unity. But if (as is, I think, already
clear from what has been said in the earlier books) Christian baptism can preserve its integrity
even amid the perversity of heretics, then even though any in those times did rebaptize, yet
without departing from the bond of unity, they might still attain to pardon in virtue of that
same love of peace, through which Cyprian bears witness that those admitted even without
baptism might obtain that they should not be separated from the gifts of the Church. Further,
if it is true that with heretics and schismatics the baptism of Christ does not exist, how much
less could the sins of others hurt those who were fixed in unity, if even men’s own sins were
forgiven when they came to it even without baptism! For if, according to Cyprian, the bond
of unity is of such efficacy, how could they be hurt by other men’s sins, who were unwilling
to separate themselves from unity, if even the unbaptized, who wished to come to it from
heresy, thereby escaped the destruction due to their own sins?</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="831"/>
<head>Chapter. 3.</head>
<p>3. But in what Cyprian adds, saying, "Nor yet because men once have
erred must there be always error, since it rather befits wise and God-fearing men gladly and
unhesitatingly to follow truth, when it is clearly laid before their eyes, than obstinately and
persistently to fight for heretics against their brethren and their fellow-priests,"1473 he is
uttering the most perfect truth; and the man who resists the manifest truth is opposing
himself rather than his neighbors. But, so far as I can judge, it is perfectly clear and certain,
from the many arguments which I have already adduced, that the baptism of Christ cannot
be invalidated even by the perversity of heretics, when it is given or received among them.
But, granting that it is not yet certain, at any rate no one who has considered what has been
said, even from a hostile point of view, will assert that the question has been decided the
other way. Therefore we are not striving against manifest truth, but either, as I think, we
are striving in behalf of what is clearly true, or, at any rate, as those may hold who think that
the question has not yet been solved, we are seeking for the truth. And therefore, if the truth
be other than we think, yet we are receiving those baptized by heretics with the same honesty
of heart with which those received them whom, Cyprian supposed, in virtue of their cleaving
to the unity of the Church, to be capable of pardon. But if the baptism of Christ, as is indicated
by the many arguments used above, can retain its integrity amid any defect either of
life or faith, whether on the part of those who seem to be within, and yet do not belong to
the members of the one dove or on the part of those whose severance from her extends to
being openly without, then those who sought its repetition in those former days deserved
the same pardon for their charity in clinging to unity, which Cyprian thought that those
deserved for charity of the same kind whom he believed to have been admitted without
baptism. They therefore who, without any cause (since, as Cyprian himself shows, the bad
cannot hurt the good in the unity of the Church), have cut themselves off from the charity
which is shown in this unity, have lost all place of pardon, and whilst they would incur destruction
by the very crime of schism, even though they did not rebaptize those who had
been baptized in the Catholic Church, of how bitter punishment are they deserving, who
are either endeavoring to give to the Catholics who have it what Cyprian affirms that they
themselves have not, or, as is clear from the facts of the case, are bringing as a charge against
the Catholic Church that she has not what even they themselves possess?</p>

<head>Chapter 4.</head>
<p>4. But since now, as I said before, we have begun a disputation with the
epistles of Cyprian, I think that I should not seem even to him, if he were present, "to be
contending obstinately and persistently in defense of heretics against my brethren and my
fellow-priests," when he learned the powerful reasons which move us to believe that even
among heretics, who are perversely obstinate in their malignant error, the baptism of Christ
is yet in itself most holy, and most highly to be reverenced. And seeing that he himself,
whose testimony has such weight with us, bears witness that they were wont in past times
to be admitted without a second baptism, I would have any one, who is induced by Cyprian’s
arguments to hold it as certain that heretics ought to be baptized afresh, yet consider that
those who, on account of weight of the arguments on the other side, are not as yet persuaded
that this should be so, hold the same place as those in past time, who in all honesty admitted
men who were baptized in heresy on the simple correction of their individual error, and
who were capable of salvation with them in virtue of the bond of unity. And let any one,
who is led by the past custom of the Church, and by the subsequent authority of a plenary
Council, and by so many powerful proofs from holy Scripture, and by much evidence from
Cyprian himself, and by the clear reasoning of truth, to understand that the baptism of
Christ, consecrated in the words of the gospel, cannot be perverted by the error of any man
on earth,—let such an one understand, that they who then thought otherwise, but yet preserved
their charity, can be saved by the same bond of unity. And herein he should also
understand of those who, in the society of the Church dispersed throughout the world, could
not have been defiled by any tares, by any chaff, so long as they themselves desired to be
fruitful corn, and who therefore severed themselves from the same bond of unity without
any cause for the divorce, that at any rate, whichever of the two opinions be true,—that
which Cyprian then held, or that which was maintained by the universal voice of the Catholic
Church, which Cyprian did not abandon,—in either case they, having most openly
placed themselves outside in the plain sacrilege of schism, cannot possibly be saved, and all
that they possess of the holy sacraments, and of the free gifts of the one legitimate Bridegroom,
is of avail, while they continue what they are, for their confusion rather than the
salvation of their souls.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="833"/>
<head>Chapter 5.</head>
<p>5. Wherefore, even if heretics should be truly anxious to correct their error
and come to the Church, for the very reason that they believed that they had no baptism
unless they received it in the Church, even under these circumstances we should not be
bound to yield to their desire for the repetition of baptism; but rather they should be taught,
on the one hand, that baptism, though perfect in itself, could in no way profit their perversity
if they would not submit to be corrected; and, on the other hand, that the perfection of
baptism could not be impaired by their perversity, while refusing to be corrected: and again,
that no further perfection is added to baptism in them because they are submitting to correction;
but that, while they themselves are quitting their iniquity, that which was before
within them to their destruction is now beginning to be of profit for salvation. For, learning
this, they will both recognize the need of salvation in Catholic unity, and will cease to claim
as their own what is really Christ’s, and will not confound the sacrament of truth, although
existing in themselves, with their own individual error.</p>
<p>6. To this we may add a further reason, that men, by a sort of hidden inspiration from
heaven, shrink from any one who for the second time receives baptism which he had already
received in any quarter whatsoever, insomuch that the very heretics themselves, when their
arguments start with that subject, rub their forehead in perplexity, and almost all their laity,
even those who have grown old in their body, and have conceived an obstinate animosity
against the Catholic Church, confess that this one point in their system displeases them;
and many who, for the sake of gaining some secular advantage, or avoiding some disadvantage,
wish to secede to them, strive with many secret efforts that they may have granted to
them, as a peculiar and individual privilege, that they should not be rebaptized; and some,
who are led to place credence in their other vain delusions and false accusations against the
Catholic Church, are recalled to unity by this one consideration, that they are unwilling to
associate with them lest they should be compelled to be rebaptized. And the Donatists,
through fear of this feeling, which has so thorough possession of all men’s hearts, have
consented to acknowledge the baptism which was conferred among the followers of Max-
imianus, whom they had condemned, and so to cut short their own tongues and close their
mouths, in preference to baptizing again so many men of the people of Musti, and Assuræ,
and other districts, whom they received with Felicianus and Prætextatus, and the others
who had been condemned by them and afterwards returned to them.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="834"/>
<head>Chapter 6.</head>
<p>7. For when this is done occasionally in the case of individuals, at great
intervals of time and space, the enormity of the deed is not equally felt; but if all were suddenly
to be brought together who had been baptized in course of time by the aforesaid followers
of Maximianus, either under pressure of the peril of death or at their Easter solemnities,
and it were told them that they must be baptized again, because what they had already received
in the sacrilege of schism was null and void, they might indeed say what obstinate
perseverance in their error would compel them to say, that they might hide the rigor and
iciness of their hardness under any kind of false shade of consistency against the warmth
of truth. But in fact, because the party of Maximianus could not bear this, and because the
very men who would have to enforce it could not endure what must needs have been done
in the case of so many men at once, especially as those very men would be rebaptizing them
in the party of Primianus who had already baptized them in the party of Maximianus, for
these reasons their baptism was received, and the pride of the Donatists was cut short. And
this course they would certainly not have chosen to adopt, had they not thought that more
harm would have been done to their cause by the offense men would have taken at the repetition
of the baptism, than by the reputation lost in abandoning their defense. And this I
would not say with any idea that we ought to be restrained by consideration of human
feelings, if the truth compelled those who came from heretics to be baptized afresh. But
because the holy Cyprian says, "that heretics might have been all the more impelled to the
necessity of coming over, if only they were to be rebaptized in the Catholic Church,"1474 on
this account I have wished to place on record the intensity of the repugnance to this act
which is seated deeply in the heart of nearly every one,—a repugnance which I can believe
was inspired by God Himself, that the Church might be fortified by the instinct of repugnance
against any possible arguments which the weak cannot dispel.</p>

<p>8. Truly, when I look at the actual words of Cyprian, I am warned to say
some things which are very necessary for the solution of this question. "For if they were to
see," he says, "that it was settled and established by our formal decision and vote, that the
baptism with which they are baptized in heresy is considered just and lawful, they will think
that they are in just and lawful possession of the Church also, and all its other gifts."1475
He does not say "that they will think they are in possession," but "in just and lawful possession
of the gifts of the Church." But we say that we cannot allow that they are in just and lawful
possession of baptism. That they are in possession of it we cannot deny, when we recognize
the sacrament of the Lord in the words of the gospel. They have therefore lawful baptism,
but they do not have it lawfully. For whosoever has it both in Catholic unity, and living
worthily of it, both has lawful baptism and has it lawfully; but whosoever has it either within
the Catholic Church itself, as chaff mixed with the wheat, or outside, as chaff carried away
by the wind, has indeed lawful baptism, but not lawfully. For he has it as he uses it. But the
man does not use it lawfully who uses it against the law,—which every one does, who, being
baptized, yet leads an abandoned life, whether inside or without the Church.</p>

<head>Chapter 8.</head>
<p>9. Wherefore, as the apostle said of the law, "The law is good, if a man use
it lawfully,"1476 so we may fairly say of baptism, Baptism is good, if a man use it lawfully.
And as they who used the law unlawfully could not in that case cause that it should not be
in itself good, or make it null and void, so any one who uses baptism unlawfully, either because
he lives in heresy, or because he lives the worst of lives, yet cannot cause that the
baptism should be otherwise than good, or altogether null and void. And so, when he is
converted either to Catholic unity, or to a mode of living worthy of so great a sacrament,
he begins to have not another and a lawful baptism, but that same baptism in a lawful
manner. Nor does the remission of irrevocable sins follow on baptism, unless a man not
only have lawful baptism, but have it lawfully; and yet it does not follow that if a man have
it not lawfully, so that his sins are either not remitted, or, being remitted, are brought on
him again, therefore the sacrament of baptism should be in the baptized person either bad
or null and void. For as Judas, to whom the Lord gave a morsel, gave a place within himself
of the devil, not by receiving what was bad, but by receiving it badly,1477 so each person, on
receiving the sacrament of the Lord, does not cause that it is bad because he is bad himself,
or that he has received nothing because he has not received it to salvation. For it was none
the less the body of the Lord and the blood of the Lord, even in those to whom the apostle
said, "He that eateth unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself."1478 Let the
heretics therefore seek in the Catholic Church not what they have, but what they have
not,—that is, the end of the commandment, without which many holy things may be possessed,
but they cannot profit. "Now, the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure
heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."1479 Let them therefore hasten to
the unity and truth of the Catholic Church, not that they may have the sacrament of washing,
if they have been already bathed in it, although in heresy, but that they may have it to their
health.</p>

<p>10. Now we must see what is said of the baptism of John. For "we read in
the Acts of the Apostles, that those who had already been baptized with the baptism of John
were yet baptized by Paul,"1480 simply because the baptism of John was not the baptism of
Christ, but a baptism allowed by Christ to John, so as to be called especially John’s baptism;
as the same John says, "A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven."1481
And that he might not possibly seem to receive this from God the Father in such wise as
not to receive it from the Son, speaking presently of Christ Himself, he says, "Of His fullness
have all we received."1482 But by the grace of a certain dispensation John received this,
which was to last not for long, but only long enough to prepare for the Lord the way in
which he must needs be the forerunner. And as our Lord was presently to enter on this way
with all humility, and to lead those who humbly followed Him to perfection, as He washed
the feet of His servants,1483 so was He willing to be baptized with the baptism of a servant.
1484 For as He set Himself to minister to the feet of those whose guide He was Himself,
so He submitted Himself to the gift of John which He Himself had given, that all might
understand what sacrilegious arrogance they would show in despising the baptism which
they ought each of them to receive from the Lord, when the Lord Himself accepted what
He Himself had bestowed upon a servant, that he might give it as his own; and that when
John, than whom no greater had arisen among them that are born of women,1485 bore such
testimony to Christ, as to confess that he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His
shoe,1486 Christ might both, by receiving his baptism, be found to be the humblest among
men, and, by taking away the place for the baptism of John, be believed to be the most high
God, at once the teacher of humility and the giver of exaltation.</p>
<p>11. For to none of the prophets, to no one at all in holy Scripture, do we read that it
was granted to baptize in the water of repentance for the remission of sins, as it was granted
to John; that, causing the hearts of the people to hang upon him through this marvellous
grace, he might prepare in them the way for Him whom he declared to be so infinitely
greater than himself. But the Lord Jesus Christ cleanses His Church by such a baptism that
on receiving it no other is required; while John gave a first washing with such a baptism that
on receiving it there was further need of the baptism of the Lord,—not that the first baptism
should be repeated, but that the baptism of Christ, for whom he was preparing the way,

<pb n="838"/>
might be further bestowed on those who had received the baptism of John. For if Christ’s
humility were not to be commended to our notice, neither would there be any need of the
baptism of John; again, if the end were in John, after his baptism there would be no need of
the baptism of Christ. But because "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every
one that believeth,"1487 it was shown by John to whom men should go, and in whom, when
they had reached Him, they should rest. The same, John, therefore, set forth both the exalted
nature of the Lord, when he placed Him far before himself, and His humility, when he
baptized Him as the lowest of the people. But if John had baptized Christ alone, he would
be thought to have been the dispenser of a better baptism, in that with which Christ alone
was baptized, than the baptism of Christ with which Christians are baptized; and again, if
all ought to be baptized first with the baptism of John, and then with that of Christ, the
baptism of Christ would deservedly seem to be lacking in fullness and perfection, as not
sufficing for salvation. Wherefore the Lord was baptized with the baptism of John, that He
might bend the proud necks of men to His own health-giving baptism; and He was not
alone baptized with it, lest He should show His own to be inferior to this, with which none
but He Himself had deserved to be baptized; and He did not allow it to continue longer, lest
the one baptism with which He baptizes might seem to need the other to precede it.</p>

<p>12. I ask, therefore, if sins were remitted by the baptism of John, what
more could the baptism of Christ confer on those whom the Apostle Paul desired to be
baptized with the baptism of Christ after they had received the baptism of John? But if sins
were not remitted by the baptism of John, were those men in the days of Cyprian better
than John, of whom he says himself that they "used to seize on estates by treacherous frauds,
and increase their gains by accumulated usuries,"1488 through whose, administration of
baptism the remission of sins was yet conferred? Or was it because they were contained
within the unity of the Church? What then? Was John not contained within that unity, the
friend of the Bridegroom, the preparer of the way of the Lord, the baptizer of the Lord
Himself? Who will be mad enough to assert this? Wherefore, although my belief is that
John so baptized with the water of repentance for the remission of sins, that those who were
baptized by him received the expectation of the remission of their sins, the actual remission
taking place in the baptism of the Lord,—just as the resurrection which is expected at the
last day is fulfilled in hope in us, as the apostle says, that "He hath raised us up together, and
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus;"1489 and again, "For we are saved by
hope;"1490 or as again John himself, while he says, "I indeed baptize you with water unto
repentance, for the remission of your sins,"1491 yet says, on seeing our Lord, "Behold the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world,"1492—nevertheless I am not disposed
to contend vehemently against any one who maintains that sins were remitted even in the
baptism of John, but that some fuller sanctification was conferred by the baptism of Christ
on those whom Paul ordered to be baptized anew.1493</p>

<p>13. For we must look at the point which especially concerns the matter
before us (whatever be the nature of the baptism of John, since it is clear that he belongs to
the unity of Christ), viz., what is the reason for which it was right that men should be baptized
again after receiving the baptism of the holy John, and why they ought not to be baptized
again after receiving the baptism of the covetous bishops. For no one denies that in the
Lord’s field John was as wheat, bearing an hundred-fold, if that be the highest rate of increase;
also no one doubts that covetousness, which is idolatry, is reckoned in the Lord’s harvest
among the chaff. Why then is a man baptized again after receiving baptism from the wheat,
and not after receiving it from the chaff? If it was because he was better than John that Paul
baptized after John, why did not also Cyprian baptize after his usurious colleagues, than
whom he was better beyond all comparison? If it was because they were in unity with him
that he did not baptize after such colleagues, neither ought Paul to have baptized after John,
because they were joined together in the same unity. Can it be that defrauders and extortioners
belong to the members of that one dove, and that he does not belong to it to whom
the full power of the Lord Jesus Christ was shown by the appearance of the Holy Spirit in
the form of a dove?1494 Truly he belongs most closely to it; but the others, who must be
separated from it either by the occasion of some scandal, or by the winnowing at the last
day, do not by any means belong to it, and yet baptism was repeated after John and not after
them. What then is the cause, except that the baptism which Paul ordered them to receive
was not the same as that which was given at the hands of John? And so in the same unity
of the Church, the baptism of Christ cannot be repeated though it be given by an usurious
minister; but those who receive the baptism of John, even from the hands of John Himself,
ought to be afterwards baptized with the baptism of Christ.</p>

<p>14. Accordingly, I too might use the words of the blessed Cyprian to turn
the hearts of those that hear me to the consideration of something truly marvellous, if I were
to say "that John, who was accounted greater among the prophets,—he who was filled with
divine grace while yet in his mother’s womb; he who was upheld in the spirit and power of
Elias; who was not the adversary, but a forerunner and herald of the Lord: who not only
foretold our Lord in words, but also showed Him to the sight; who baptized Christ Himself,
through whom all others are baptized,"1495—he was not worthy to baptize in such wise that
those who were baptized by him should not be baptized again after him; and shall no one
think that a man should be baptized in the Church after he had been baptized by the covetous,
by defrauders, by extortioners, by usurers? Is not the answer ready to this invidious question,
Why do you think this unmeet, as though either John were dishonored, or the covetous
man honored? But His baptism ought not to be repeated, of whom John says, "The same
is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."1496 For whoever be the minister by whose
hands it is given, it is His baptism of whom it was said, "The same is He which baptizeth."
But neither was the baptism of John himself repeated, when the Apostle Paul commanded
those who had been baptized by him to be baptized in Christ. For what they had not received
from the friend of the Bridegroom, this it was right that they should receive from the
Bridegroom Himself, of whom that friend had said, "The same is He which baptizeth with
the Holy Ghost."</p>

<head>Chapter 13.</head>
<p>15. For the Lord Jesus might, if He had so thought fit, have given the
power of His baptism to some one or more of His chief servants, whom He had already
made His friends, such as those to whom He says, "Henceforth I call you not servants, but
friends;"1497 that, as Aaron was shown to be the priest by the rod that budded,1498 so in His
Church, when more and greater miracles are performed, the ministers of more excellent
holiness, and the dispensers of His mysteries, might be made manifest by some sign, as those
who alone ought to baptize. But if this had been done, then though the power of baptizing
were given them by the Lord, yet it would necessarily be called their own baptism, as in the
case of the baptism of John. And so Paul gives thanks to God that he baptized none of those
men who, as though forgetting in whose name they had been baptized, were for dividing
themselves into factions under the names of different individuals.1499 For when baptism
is as valid at the hands of a contemptible man as it was when given by an apostle, it is recognized
as the baptism neither of this man nor of that, but of Christ; as John bears witness
that he learned, in the case of the Lord Himself, through the appearance of the dove. For
in what other respect he said, "And I knew Him not," I cannot clearly see. For if he had not
known Him in any sense, he could not have said to Him when He came to his baptism, "I
have need to be baptized of Thee."1500 What is it, therefore, that he says, "I saw the Spirit
descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I knew Him not: but
He that sent me to baptizewith water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shall see
the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost?"1501 The dove clearly descended on Him after He was baptized. But while He was
yet coming to be baptized, John had said, "I have need to be baptized of Thee." He therefore
already knew Him. What does he therefore mean by the words, "I knew Him not: but He
that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the
Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost," since this took place after He was baptized, unless it were that he knew Him in respect
of certain attributes, and in respect of others knew Him not? He knew Him, indeed, as the
Son of God, the Bridegroom, of whose fullness all should receive; but whereas of His fullness
he himself had so received the power of baptizing that it should be called the baptism of
John, he did not know whether He would so give it to others also, or whether He would
have His own baptism in such wise, that at whosesoever hands it was given, whether by a
man that brought forth fruit a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold, whether by the wheat

or by the chaff, it should be known to be of Him alone; and this he learned through the
Spirit descending like a dove, and abiding on Him.</p>

<p>16. Accordingly we find the apostles using the expressions, "My glorying,"
1502 though it was certainly in the Lord; and "Mine office,"1503 and "My knowledge,"1504
and "My gospel,"1505 although it was confessedly bestowed and given by the Lord; but no
one of them ever once said, "My baptism." For neither is the glorying of all of them equal,
nor do they all minister with equal powers, nor are they all endowed with equal knowledge,
and in preaching the gospel one works more forcibly than another, and so one may be said
to be more learned than another in the doctrine of salvation itself; but one cannot be said
to be more or less baptized than another, whether he be baptized by a greater or a less worthy
minister. So when "the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousnness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, strife, seditions,
heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like;"1506 if it be strange that it should
be said, "Men were baptized after John, and are not baptized after heretics," why is it not
equally strange that it should be said, "Men were baptized after John, and are not baptized
after the envious," seeing that Cyprian himself bears witness in his epistle concerning envy
and malignity that the covetous are of the party of the devil, and Cyprian himself makes it
manifest from the words of the Apostle Paul, as we have shown above, that in the time of
the apostles themselves there were envious persons in the Church of Christ among the very
preachers of the name of Christ?</p>

<p>17. That therefore the baptism of John was not the same as the baptism
of Christ, has, I think, been shown with sufficient clearness; and therefore no argument can
be drawn from it that baptism should be repeated after heretics because it was repeated after
John: since John was not a heretic, and could have a baptism, which, though granted by
Christ, was yet not the very baptism of Christ, seeing that he had the love of Christ; while
a heretic can have at once the baptism of Christ and the perversity of the devil, as another
within the Church may have at once the baptism of Christ and the envy of the devil.</p>
<p>18. But it will be urged that baptism after a heretic is much more required, because
John was not a heretic, and yet baptism was repeated after him. On this principle, a man
may say, much more must we rebaptize after a drunkard, because John was sober, and yet
baptism was repeated after him. And we shall have no answer to make to such a man, save
that the baptism of Christ was given to those who were baptized by John, because they had
it not; but where men have the baptism of Christ, no iniquity on their part can possibly effect
that the baptism of Christ should fail to be in them.</p>
<p>19. It is not therefore true that "by baptizing first, the heretic obtains the right of baptism;"
1507 but because he did not baptize with his own baptism, and though he did not
possess the right of baptizing, yet that which he gave is Christ’s, and he who received it is
Christ’s. For many things are given wrongfully and yet they are not therefore said to be
non-existent or not given at all. For neither does he who renounces the world in word only
and not in deed receive baptism lawfully, and yet he does receive it. For both Cyprian records
that there were such men in the Church in his day, and we ourselves experience and lament
the fact.</p>
<p>20. But it is strange in what sense it can be said that "baptism and the Church cannot
in any way be separated and detached from one another."1508 For if baptism remains inseparably
in him who is baptized, how can it be that he can be separated from the Church, and
baptism cannot? But it is clear that baptism does remain inseparably in the baptized person;
because into whatever depth of evil, and into whatever fearful whirlpool of sin the baptized
person may fall, even to the ruin of apostasy, he yet is not bereft of his baptism. And
therefore, if through repentance he returns, it is not given again, because it is judged that
he could not have been bereft of it. But who can ever doubt that a baptized person can be
separated from the Church? For hence all the heresies have proceeded which deceive by
the use of Christian terms.</p>

<pb n="846"/>
<head>Chapter 16.</head>
<p>Wherefore, since it is manifest that the baptism remains in the baptized
person when he is separated from the Church, the baptism which is in him is certainly separated
with him. And therefore not all who retain the baptism retain the Church, just as
not all who retain the Church retain eternal life. Or if we say that only those retain the
Church who observe the commandments of God, we at once concede that there are many
who retain baptism, and do not retain the Church.</p>
<p>21. Therefore the heretic is not "the first to seize baptism," since he has received it from
the Church. Nor, though he seceded, could baptism have been lost by him whom we assert
no longer to retain the Church, and yet allow to retain baptism. Nor does any one "yield
his birthright, and give it to a heretic,"1509 because he says that he took away with him what
he could not give lawfully, but what would yet be according to law when given; or that he
no longer has lawfully what yet is in accordance with law in his possession. But the birthright
rests only in a holy conversation and good life, to which all belong of whom that bride
consists as her members which has no spot or wrinkle,1510 or that dove that groans amid
the wickedness of the many crows,—unless it be that, while Esau lost his birthright from
his lust after a mess of pottage,1511 we are yet to hold that it is retained by defrauders, robbers,
usurers, envious persons, drunkards and the like, over whose existence in the Church of his
time Cyprian groaned in his epistles. Wherefore, either it is not the same thing to retain
the Church and to retain the birthright in divine things, or, if every one who retains the
Church also retains the birthright, then all those wicked ones do not retain the Church who
yet both seem and are allowed by every one of us to give baptism within the Church; for no
one, save the man who is wholly ignorant of sacred things, would say that they retain the
birthright in sacred things.</p>

<p>22. But, having considered and handled all these points, we have now
come to that peaceful utterance of Cyprian at the end of the epistle, with which I am never
sated, though I read and re-read it again and again,—so great is the pleasantness of brotherly
love which breathes forth from it, so great the sweetness of charity in which it abounds.
"These things," he says, "we have written unto you, dearest brother, shortly, according to
our poor ability, prescribing to or prejudging no one, lest each bishop should not do what
he thinks right, in the free exercise of his own will. We, so far as in us lies, do not contend
on the subject of heretics with our colleagues and fellow-bishops, with whom we maintain
concord and peace in the Lord; especially as the apostle also says, ‘If any man seem to be
contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.’1512 We observe patiently
and gently charity of spirit, the honor of our brotherhood, the bond of faith, the harmony
of the priesthood. For this reason also, to the best of our poor ability, by the permission
and the inspiration of God we have written this treatise on ‘The Good of Patience,’ which
we have sent to you in consideration of our mutual love."1513</p>
<p>23. There are many things to be considered in these words, wherein the brightness of
Christian charity shines forth in this man, who "loved the beauty of the Lord’s house, and
the place of the tabernacle of His habitation."1514 First, that he did not conceal what he felt;
then, that he set it forth so gently and peacefully, in that he maintained the peace of the
Church with those who thought otherwise, because he understood how great healthfulness
was bound up in the bond of peace, loving it so much, and maintaining it with sobriety,
seeing and feeling that even men who think differently may entertain their several sentiments
with saving charity. For he would not say that he could maintain divine concord or the
peace of the Lord with evil men; for the good man can observe peace towards wicked men,
but he cannot be united with them in the peace which they have not. Lastly, that prescribing
to no one, and prejudging no one, lest each bishop should not do what he thinks right in
the free exercise of his own will, he has left for us also, whatsoever we may be, a place for
treating peacefully of those things with him. For he is present, not only in his letters, but
by that very charity which existed in so extraordinary a degree in him, and which can never
die. Longing, therefore, with the aid of his prayers, to cling to and be in union with him, if

severed from the Church throughout the world. For in that, when that question was yet
undecided for want of full discussion, though his sentiments differed from those of many
of his colleagues, yet he observed so great moderation, that he would not mutilate the sacred
fellowship of the Church of God by any stain of schism, a greater strength of excellence appeared
in him than would have been shown if, without that virtue, he had held views on
every point not only true, but coinciding with their own. Nor should I be acting as he would
wish, if I were to pretend to prefer his talent and his fluency of discourse and copiousness
of learning to the holy Council of all nations, whereat he was assuredly present through the
unity of his spirit, especially as he is now placed in such full light of truth as to see with
perfect certainty what he was here seeking in the spirit of perfect peace. For out of that rich
abundance he smiles at all that here seems eloquence in us, as though it were the first essay
of infancy; there he sees by what rule of piety he acted here, that nothing should be dearer
in the Church to him than unity. There, too, with unspeakable delight he beholds with what
prescient and most merciful providence the Lord, that He might heal our swellings, "chose
the foolish things of the world to confound the wise," 1515 and, in the ordering of the
members of His Church, placed all things in such a healthful way, that men should not say
that they were chosen to the help of the gospel for their own talent or learning, of whose
source they yet were ignorant, and so be puffed up with deadly pride. Oh, how Cyprian
rejoices! With how much more perfect calmness does he behold how greatly it conduces
to the health of the human race, that in the writings even of Christian and pious orators
there should be found what merits blame, and in the writings of the fishermen there should
nothing of the sort be found! And so I, being fully assured of this joy of that holy soul,
neither in any way venture to think or say that my writings are free from every kind of error,
nor, in opposing that opinion of his, wherein it seemed to him that those who came from
among heretics were to be received otherwise than either they had been in former days, as
he himself bears witness, or are now received, as is the reasonable custom, confirmed by a
plenary Council of the whole Christian world, do I set against him my own view, but that
of the holy Catholic Church, which he so loved and loves, in which he brought forth such
abundant fruit with tolerance, whose entirety he himself was not, but in whose entirety he
remained; whose root he never left, but, though he already brought forth fruit from its root,
he was purged by the heavenly Husbandman that he should bring forth more fruit;1516 for
whose peace and safety, that the wheat might not be rooted out together with the tares, he
both reproved with the freedom of truth, and endured with the grace of charity, so many
evils on the part of men who were placed in unity with himself.</p>

<p>24. Whence Cyprian himself1517 again admonishes us with the greatest
fullness, that many who were dead in their trespasses and sins, although they did not belong
to the body of Christ, and the members of that innocent and guileless dove (so that if she
alone baptized, they certainly could not baptize), yet to all appearance seemed both to be
baptized and to baptize within the Church. And among them, however dead they are, their
baptism nevertheless lives, which is not dead, and death shall have no more dominion over
it. Since, therefore, there be dead men within the Church, nor are they concealed, for else
Cyprian would not have spoken of them so much, who either do not belong at all to that
living dove, or at least do not as yet belong to her; and since there be dead men without,
who yet more clearly do not belong to her at all, or not as yet; and since it is true that "another
man cannot be quickened by one who himself liveth not,"—it is therefore clear that
those who within are baptized by such persons, if they approach the sacrament with true
conversion of heart, are quickened by Him whose baptism it is. But if they renounce the
world in word and not in deed, as Cyprian declares to be the case with some who are within,
it is then manifest that they are not themselves quickened unless they be converted, and yet
that they have true baptism even though they be not converted. Whence also it is likewise
clear that those who are dead without, although they neither "live themselves, nor quicken
others," yet have the living baptism, which would profit them unto life so soon as they should
be converted unto peace.</p>

<p>25. Wherefore, as regards those who received the persons who came from
heresy in the same baptism of Christ with which they had been baptized outside the Church,
and said "that they followed ancient custom," as indeed the Church now receives such, it is
in vain urged against them "that among the ancients there were as yet only the first beginning
of heresy and schisms,1518 so that those were involved in them who were seceders from the
Church, and had originally been baptized within the Church, so that it was not necessary
that they should be baptized again when they returned and did penance." For so soon as
each several heresy existed, and departed from the communion of the Catholic Church, it
was possible that, I will not even say the next day, but even on that very day, its votaries
might have baptized some who flocked to them. And therefore if this was the old custom,
that they should be so received into the Church (as could not be denied even by those who
maintained the contrary part in the discussion), there can be no doubt in the mind of any
one who pays careful attention to the matter, that those also were so received who had been
baptized without in heresy.</p>
<p>26. But I cannot see what show of reason there is in this, that the name of "erring
sheep"1519 should be denied to one whose lot it has been that, while seeking the salvation
which is in Christ, he has fallen into the error of heretics, and been baptized in their body;
while he is held to have become a sheep already within the body of the Catholic Church
herself, who has renounced the world in words and not in deeds, and has received baptism
in such falseness of heart as this. Or if such an one also does not become a sheep unless
after turning to God with a true heart, then, as he is not baptized at the time when he becomes
a sheep, if he had been already baptized, but was not yet a sheep; so he too, who comes from
the heretics that he may become a sheep, is not then to be baptized if he had been already
baptized with the same baptism, though he was not yet a sheep. Wherefore, since even all
the bad that are within—the covetous, the envious, the drunkards, and those that live contrary
to the discipline of Christ—may be deservedly called liars, and in darkness, and dead, and
antichrists, do they yet therefore not baptize, on the ground that "there can be nothing
common between truth and falsehood, between light and darkness, between death and immortality,
between Antichrist and Christ?"1520</p>
<p>27. He makes an assumption, then, not "of mere custom," but "of the reason of truth
itself,"1521 when he says that the sacrament of God cannot be turned to error by the error

of any men, since it is declared to exist even in those who have erred. Assuredly the Apostle
John says most plainly, "He that hateth his brother is in darkness even until now;"1522 and
again, "Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer;"1523 and why, therefore, do they baptize
those within the Church whom Cyprian himself declares to be in the envy of malice?1524</p>

<p>How does a murderer cleanse and sanctify the water?1525 How can
darkness bless the oil? But if God is present in His sacraments to confirm His words by
whomsoever the sacraments may be administered, then both the sacraments of God are
everywhere valid, and evil men whom they profit not are everywhere perverse.</p>
<p>28. But what kind of argument is this, that "a heretic must be considered not to have
baptism, because he has not the Church?" And it must be acknowledged that "when he is
baptized, he is questioned about the Church."1526 Just as though the same question about
the Church were not put in baptism to him who within the Church renounces the world in
word and not in deed. As therefore his false answer does not prevent what he receives from
being baptism, so also the false reply of the other about the holy Church does not prevent
what he receives from being baptism; and as the former, if he afterwards fulfill with truth
what he promised in falsehood, does not receive a second baptism, but only an amended
life, so also in the case of the latter, if he come afterwards to the Church about which he
gave a false answer to the question put to him, thinking that he had it when he had it not,
the Church herself which he did not possess is given him, but what he had received is not
repeated. But I cannot tell why it should be, that while God can "sanctify the oil" in answer
to the words which proceed out of the mouth of a murderer, "He yet cannot sanctify it on
the altar reared by a heretic," unless it be that He who is not hindered by the false conversion
of the heart of man within the Church is hindered by the false erection of some wood without
from deigning to be present in His sacraments, though no falseness on the part of men can
hinder Him. If, therefore, what is said in the gospel, that "God heareth not sinners,"1527
extends so far that the sacraments cannot be celebrated by a sinner, how then does He hear
a murderer praying, either over the water of baptism, or over the oil, or over the eucharist,
or over the heads of those on whom his hand is laid? All which things are nevertheless done,
and are valid, even at the hands of murderers, that is, at the hands of those who hate their
brethren, even within, in the Church itself. Since "no one can give what he does not possess
himself," 1528 how does a murderer give the Holy Spirit? And yet such an one even baptizeth
within the Church. It is God, therefore, that gives the Holy Spirit even when a man of this
kind is baptizing.</p>

<p>29. But as to what he says, that "he who comes to the Church is to be
baptized and renewed, that within he may be hallowed through the holy,"1529 what will he
do, if within also he meets with those who are not holy? Or can it be that the murderer is
holy? And if the reason for his being baptized in the Church is that "he should put off this
very thing also that he, being a man that sought to come to God, fell, through the deceit of
error, on one profane,"1530 where is he afterwards to put off this, that he may chance, while
seeking a man of God within the Church itself, to have fallen, through the deceit of error,
on a murderer? If "there cannot be in a man something that is void and something that is
valid,"1531 why is it possible that in a murderer the sacrament should be holy and his heart
unholy? If "whosoever cannot give the Holy Spirit cannot baptize,"1532 why does the murderer
baptize within the Church? Or how has the murderer the Holy Spirit, when every
one that has the Holy Spirit is filled with light, but "he who hates his brother is still in
darkness?"1533 If because "there is one baptism, and one Spirit,"1534 therefore they cannot
have the one baptism who have not the one Spirit, why do the innocent man and the murderer
within the Church have the one baptism and not have the one Spirit? So therefore
the heretic and the Catholic may have the one baptism, and yet not have the one Church,
as in the Catholic Church the innocent man and the murderer may have the one baptism,
though they have not the one Spirit; for as there is one baptism, so there is one Spirit and
one Church. And so the result is, that in each person we must acknowledge what he already
has, and to each person we must give what he has not. If "nothing can be confirmed and
ratified with God which has been done by those whom God calls His enemies and foes,"1535
why is the baptism confirmed which is given by murderers? Are we not to call murderers
the enemies and foes of the Lord? But "he that hateth his brother is a murderer." How then
did they baptize who hated Paul, the servant of Jesus Christ, and thereby hated Jesus Himself,
since He Himself said to Saul, "Why persecutest thou me?"1536 when he was persecuting
His servants, and since at the last He Himself shall say, "Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of
the least of these that are mine, ye did it not to me?"1537 Wherefore all who go out from us
are not of us, but not all who are with us are of us; just as when men thresh, all that flies

from the threshing-floor is shown not to be corn, but not all that remains there is therefore
corn. And so John too says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us."1538 Wherefore God gives the
sacrament of grace even through the hands of wicked men, but the grace itself only by
Himself or through His saints. And therefore He gives remission of sins either of Himself,
or through the members of that dove to whom He says, "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they
are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained."1539 But since
no one can doubt that baptism, which is the sacrament of the remission of sins, is possessed
even by murderers, who are yet in darkness because the hatred of their brethren is not excluded
from their hearts, therefore either no remission of sins is given to them if their baptism
is accompanied by no change of heart for the better, or if the sins are remitted, they at once
return on them again. And we learn that the baptism is holy in itself, because it is of God;
and whether it be given or whether it be received by men of such like character, it cannot
be polluted by any perversity of theirs, either within, or yet outside the Church.</p>

<p>30. Accordingly we agree with Cyprian that "heretics cannot give remission
of sins;"1540 but we maintain that they can give baptism,—which indeed in them, both when
they give and when they receive it, is profitable only to their destruction, as misusing so
great a gift of God; just as also the malicious and envious, whom Cyprian himself acknowledges
to be within the Church, cannot give remission of sins, while we all confess that they
can give baptism. For if it was said of those who have sinned against us, "If ye forgive not
men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,"1541 how much more
impossible is it that their sins should be forgiven who hate the brethren by whom they are
loved, and are baptized in that very hatred; and yet when they are brought to the right way,
baptism is not given them anew, but that very pardon which they did not then deserve is
granted them in their true conversion? And so even what Cyprian wrote to Quintus, and
what, in conjunction with his colleagues Liberalis, Caldonius, Junius, and the rest, he wrote
to Saturninus, Maximus, and others, is all found, on due consideration, to be in no wise
meet to be preferred as against the agreement of the whole Catholic Church, of which they
rejoiced that they were members, and from which they neither cut themselves away nor allowed
others to be cut away who held a contrary opinion, until at length, by the will of the
Lord, it was made manifest, by a plenary Council many years afterwards, what was the more
perfect way, and that not by the institution of any novelty, but by confirming what was old.</p>

<p>31. Cyprian writes also to Pompeius1542 about this selfsame matter, and
clearly shows in that letter that Stephen, who, as we learn, was then bishop of the Roman
Church, not only did not agree with him upon the points before us, but even wrote and
taught the opposite views. But Stephen certainly did not "communicate with heretics,"1543
merely because he did not dare to impugn the baptism of Christ, which he knew remained
perfect in the midst of their perversity. For if none have baptism who entertain false views
about God, it has been proved sufficiently, in my opinion, that this may happen even within
the Church. "The apostles," indeed, "gave no injunctions on the point;"1544 but the custom,
which is opposed to Cyprian, may be supposed to have had its origin in apostolic tradition,
just as there are many things which are observed by the whole Church, and therefore are
fairly held to have been enjoined by the apostles, which yet are not mentioned in their
writings.</p>
<p>32. But it will be urged that it is written of heretics that "they are condemned of themselves."
1545 What then? are they not also condemned of themselves to whom it was said,
"For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself?"1546 But to these the apostle
says, "Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"1547 and so forth. And
such truly were they who, being bishops and established in Catholic unity with Cyprian
himself, used to plunder estates by treacherous frauds, preaching all the time to the people
the words of the apostle, who says, "Nor shall extortioners inherit the kingdom of God."1548</p>
<p>33. Wherefore I will do no more than run shortly through the other sentiments founded
on the same rules, which are in the aforesaid letter written to Pompeius. By what authority
of holy Scripture is it shown that "it is against the commandment of God that persons
coming from the society of heretics, if they have already there received the baptism of Christ,
are not baptized again?"1549 But it is clearly shown that many pretended Christians, though
they are not joined in the same bond of charity with the saints, without which anything holy
that they may have been able to possess is of no profit to them, yet have baptism in common
with the saints, as has been already sufficiently proved with the greatest fullness. He says
"that the Church, and the Spirit, and baptism, are mutually incapable of separation from
each other, and therefore" he wishes that "those who are separated from the Church and the

Holy Spirit should be understood to be separated also from baptism."1550 But if this is the
case, then when any one has received baptism in the Catholic Church, it remains so long in
him as he himself remains in the Church, which is not so. For it is not restored to him when
he returns, just because he did not lose it when he seceded. But as the disaffected sons have
not the Holy Spirit in the same manner as the beloved sons, and yet they have baptism; so
heretics also have not the Church as Catholics have, and yet they have baptism. "For the
Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit,"1551 and yet baptism will not flee from it. And so,
as baptism can continue in one from whom the Holy Spirit withdraws Himself, so can
baptism continue where the Church is not. But if "the laying on of hands" were not "applied
to one coming from heresy,"1552 he would be as it were judged to be wholly blameless; but
for the uniting of love, which is the greatest gift of the Holy Spirit, without which any other
holy thing that there may be in a man is profitless to his salvation, hands are laid on heretics
when they are brought to a knowledge of the truth.1553</p>

<p>34. I remember that I have already discussed at sufficient length the
question of "the temple of God," and how this saying is to be taken, "As many of you as have
been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."1554 For neither are the covetous the temple
of God, since it is written, "What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?"1555 And
Cyprian has adduced the testimony of Paul to the fact that covetousness is idolatry. But
men put on Christ, sometimes so far as to receive the sacrament, sometimes so much further
as to receive holiness of life. And the first of these is common to good and bad alike; the
second, peculiar to the good and pious. Wherefore, if "baptism cannot be without the
Spirit," then heretics have the Spirit also,—but to destruction, not to salvation, just as was
the case with Saul.1556 For in the Holy Spirit devils are cast out through the name of Christ,
which even he was able to do who was without the Church, which called forth a suggestion
from the disciples to their Lord.1557 Just as the covetous have the Holy Spirit, who yet are
not the temple of God. For "what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?" If therefore
the covetous have not the Spirit of God, and yet have baptism, it is possible for baptism to
exist without the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>35. If therefore heresy is rendered "unable to engender sons to God through Christ,
because it is not the bride of Christ,"1558 neither can that crowd of evil men established
within the Church, since it is also not the bride of Christ; for the bride of Christ is described
as being without spot or wrinkle.1559 Therefore either not all baptized persons are the sons
of God, or even that which is not the bride can engender the sons of God. But as it is asked
whether "he is spiritually born who has received the baptism of Christ in the midst of
heretics,"1560 so it may be asked whether he is spiritually born who has received the baptism
of Christ in the Catholic Church, without being turned to God in a true heart, of whom it
cannot be said that he has not received baptism.</p>

<p>36. I am unwilling to go on to handle again what Cyprian poured forth
with signs of irritation against Stephen, as it is, moreover, quite unnecessary. For they are
but the selfsame arguments which have already been sufficiently discussed; and it is better
to pass over those points which involved the danger of baneful dissension. But Stephen
thought that we should even hold aloof from those who endeavored to destroy the primitive
custom in the matter of receiving heretics; whereas Cyprian, moved by the difficulty of the
question itself, and being most largely endowed with the holy bowels of Christian charity,
thought that we ought to remain at unity with those who differed in opinion from ourselves.
Therefore, although he was not without excitement, though of a truly brotherly kind, in his
indignation, yet the peace of Christ prevailed in their hearts, that in such a dispute no evil
of schism should arise between them. But it was not found that "hence grew more abundant
heresies and schisms,"1561 because what is of Christ in them is approved, and what is of
themselves is condemned; for all the more those who hold this law of rebaptizing were cut
into smaller fragments.</p>

<p>37. To go on to what he says, "that a bishop should be ‘teachable,’"1562
adding, "But he is teachable who is gentle and meek to learn; for a bishop ought not only to
teach, but to learn as well, since he is indeed the better teacher who daily grows and advances
by learning better things;"1563—in these words assuredly the holy man, endowed with pious
charity, sufficiently points out that we should not hesitate to read his letters in such a sense,
that we should feel no difficulty if the Church should afterwards confirm what had been
discovered by further and longer discussions; because, as there were many things which the
learned Cyprian might teach, so there was still something which the teachable Cyprian
might learn. But the admonition that he gives us, "that we should go back to the fountain,
that is, to apostolic tradition, and thence turn the channel of truth to our times,"1564 is most
excellent, and should be followed without hesitation. It is handed down to us, therefore, as
he himself records, by the apostles, that there is "one God, and one Christ, and one hope,
and one faith, and one Church, and one baptism."1565 Since then we find that in the times
of the apostles themselves there were some who had not the one hope, but had the one
baptism, the truth is so brought down to us from the fountain itself, that it is clear to us that
it is possible that though there is one Church, as there is one hope, and one baptism, they
may yet have the one baptism who have not the one Church; just as even in those early times
it was possible that men should have the one baptism who had not the one hope. For how
had they one hope with the holy and the just, who used to say, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow
we die,"1566 asserting that there was no resurrection of the dead? And yet they
were among the very men to whom the same apostle says, "Was Paul crucified for you? or
were you baptized in the name of Paul?"1567 For he writes most manifestly to them, saying,
"How say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"1568</p>

<p>38. And in that the Church is thus described in the Song of Songs, "A
garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed, a well of living
water; thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;"1569 I dare not understand
this save of the holy and just,—not of the covetous, and defrauders, and robbers,
and usurers, and drunkards, and the envious, of whom we yet both learn most fully from
Cyprian’s letters, as I have often shown, and teach ourselves, that they had baptism in
common with the just, in common with whom they certainly had not Christian charity.
For I would that some one would tell me how they "crept into the garden enclosed and the
fountain sealed," of whom Cyprian bears witness that they renounced the world in word
and not in deed, and that yet they were within the Church. For if they both are themselves
there, and are themselves the bride of Christ, can she then be as she is described "without
spot or wrinkle,"1570 and is the fair dove defiled with such a portion of her members? Are
these the thorns among which she is a lily, as it is said in the same Song?1571 So far therefore,
as the lily extends, so far does "the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed," namely, through
all those just persons who are Jews inwardly in the circumcision of the heart1572 (for "the
king’s daughter is all glorious within"1573), in whom is the fixed number of the saints predestined
before the foundation of the world. But that multitude of thorns, whether in secret
or in open separation, is pressing on it from without, above number. "If I would declare
them," it is said, "and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered."1574 The number,
therefore, of the just persons, "who are the called according to His purpose,"1575 of whom
it is said, "The Lord knoweth them that are His,"1576 is itself "the garden enclosed, the
fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits."
Of this number some live according to the Spirit, and enter on the excellent way of charity;
and when they "restore a man that is overtaken in a fault in the spirit of meekness, they
consider themselves, lest they also be tempted."1577 And when it happens that they also are
themselves overtaken, the affection of charity is but a little checked, and not extinguished;
and again rising up and being kindled afresh, it is restored to its former course. For they
know how to say, "My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto Thy

word."1578 But when "in anything they be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this
unto them,"1579 if they abide in the burning flame of charity, and do not break the bond of
peace. But some who are yet carnal, and full of fleshly appetites, are instant in working out
their progress; and that they may become fit for heavenly food, they are nourished with the
milk of the holy mysteries, they avoid in the fear of God whatever is manifestly corrupt even
in the opinion of the world, and they strive most watchfully that they may be less and less
delighted with worldly and temporal matters. They observe most constantly the rule of
faith which has been sought out with diligence; and if in aught they stray from it, they submit
to speedy correction under Catholic authority, although, in Cyprian’s words, they be tossed
about, by reason of their fleshly appetite, with the various conflicts of phantasies. There are
some also who as yet live wickedly, or even lie in heresies or the superstitions of the Gentiles,
and yet even then "the Lord knoweth them that are His." For, in that unspeakable foreknowledge
of God, many who seem to be without are in reality within, and many who seem to
be within yet really are without. Of all those, therefore, who, if I may so say, are inwardly
and secretly within, is that "enclosed garden" composed, "the fountain sealed, a well of living
water, the orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits." The divinely imparted gifts of
these are partly peculiar to themselves, as in this world the charity that never faileth, and in
the world to come eternal life; partly they are common with evil and perverse men, as all
the other things in which consist the holy mysteries.</p>

<p>39. Hence, therefore, we have now set before us an easier and more simple
consideration of that ark of which Noah was the builder and pilot. For Peter says that in
the ark of Noah, "few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. The like figure whereunto
even baptism doth also now save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
answer of a good conscience towards God)." 1580 Wherefore, if those appear to men to be
baptized in Catholic unity who renounce the world in words only and not in deeds, how do
they belong to the mystery of this ark in whom there is not the answer of a good conscience?
Or how are they saved by water, who, making a bad use of holy baptism, though they seem
to be within, yet persevere to the end of their days in a wicked and abandoned course of
life? Or how can they fail to be saved by water, of whom Cyprian himself records that they
were in time past simply admitted to the Church with the baptism which they had received
in heresy? For the same unity of the ark saved them, in which no one has been saved except
by water. For Cyprian himself says, "The Lord is able of His mercy to grant pardon, and
not to sever from the gifts of His Church those who, being in all simplicity admitted to the
Church, have fallen asleep within her pale."1581 If not by water, how in the ark? If not in
the ark, how in the Church? But if in the Church, certainly in the ark; and if in the ark,
certainly by water. It is therefore possible that some who have been baptized without may
be considered, through the foreknowledge of God, to have been really baptized within, because
within the water begins to be profitable to them unto salvation; nor can they be said
to have been otherwise saved in the ark except by water. And again, some who seemed to
have been baptized within may be considered, through the same foreknowledge of God,
more truly to have been baptized without, since, by making a bad use of baptism, they die
by water, which then happened to no one who was not outside the ark. Certainly it is clear
that, when we speak of within and without in relation to the Church, it is the position of
the heart that we must consider, not that of the body, since all who are within in heart are
saved in the unity of the ark through the same water, through which all who are in heart
without, whether they are also in body without or not, die as enemies of unity. As therefore
it was not another but the same water that saved those who were placed within the ark, and
destroyed those who were left without the ark, so it is not by different baptisms, but by the
same, that good Catholics are saved, and bad Catholics or heretics perish. But what the
most blessed Cyprian thinks of the Catholic Church, and how the heretics are utterly crushed
by his authority; notwithstanding the much I have already said, I have yet determined to
set forth by itself, if God will, with somewhat greater fullness and perspicuity, so soon as I
shall have first said about his Council what I think is due from me, which, in God’s will, I
shall attempt in the following book.</p>

<p>1. It might perhaps have been sufficient, that after the reasons have been
so often repeated, and considered, and discussed with such variety of treatment, supplemented
too, with the addition of proofs from holy Scripture, and the concurrent testimony of
so many passages from Cyprian himself, even those who are slow of heart should thus understand,
as I believe they do, that the baptism of Christ cannot be rendered void by any
perversity on the part of man, whether in administering or receiving it. And when we find
that in those times, when the point in question was decided in a manner contrary to ancient
custom, after discussions carried on without violation of saving charity and unity, it appeared
to some even eminent men who were bishops of Christ, among whom the blessed Cyprian
was specially conspicuous, that the baptism of Christ could not exist among heretics or
schismatics, this simply arose from their not distinguishing the sacrament from the effect
or use of the sacrament; and because its effect and use were not found among heretics in
freeing them from their sins and setting their hearts right, the sacrament itself was also
thought to be wanting among them. But if we turn our eyes to the multitude of chaff within
the Church, since these also who are perverse and lead an abandoned life in unity itself appear
to have no power either of giving or retaining remission of sins, seeing that it is not to the
wicked but the good sons that it was said, "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained,"1582 yet that such persons
both have, and give, and receive the sacrament of baptism, was sufficiently manifest to the
pastors of the Catholic Church dispersed over the whole world, through whom the original
custom was afterwards confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council; so that even the
sheep which was straying outside, and had received the mark of the Lord from false plunderers
outside, if it seek the salvation of Christian unity, is purified from error, is freed from
captivity, is healed of its wound, and yet the mark of the Lord is recognized rather than rejected
in it; since the mark itself is often impressed both by wolves and on wolves, who seem
indeed to be within the fold, but yet are proved by the fruits of their conduct, in which they
persevere even to the end, not to belong to that sheep which is one in many; because, according
to the foreknowledge of God, as many sheep wander outside, so many wolves lurk
treacherously within, among whom the Lord yet knoweth them that are His, which hear
only the voice of the Shepherd, even when He calls by the voice of men like the Pharisees,
of whom it was said, "Whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do."1583</p>
<p>2. For as the spiritual man, keeping "the end of the commandment," that is, "charity
out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,"1584 can see some
things less clearly out of a body which is yet "corruptible and presseth down the soul,"1585

and is liable to be otherwise minded in some things which God will reveal1586 to him in His
own good time if he abide in the same charity, so in a carnal and perverse man something
good and useful may be found, which has its origin not in the man himself, but in some
other source. For as in the fruitful branch there is found something which must be purged
that it may bring forth more fruit, so also a grape is often found to hang on a cane that is
barren and dry or fettered. And so, as it is foolish to love the portions which require purg
ing in the fruitful branch, while he acts wisely who does not reject the sweet fruit wherever
it may hang, so, if any one cuts himself off from unity by rebaptizing, simply because it
seemed to Cyprian that one ought to baptize again those who came from the heretics, such
a man turns aside from what merits praise in that great man, and follows what requires
correction, and does not even attain to the very thing he follows after. For Cyprian, while
grievously abhorring, in his zeal for God, all those who severed themselves from unity,
thought that thereby they were separated from baptism itself; while these men, thinking it
at most a slight offense that they themselves are severed from the unity of Christ, even
maintain that His baptism is not in that unity, but issued forth with them. Therefore they
are so far from the fruitfulness of Cyprian, as not even to be equal to the parts in him which
needed purging.</p>
<note type="footnote">1586 Phil. iii. 15.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="867"/>
<head>Chapter 2.</head>
<p>3. Again, if any one not having charity, and walking in the abandoned
paths of a most wicked life, seems to be within while he really is without, and at the same
time does not seek for the repetition of baptism even in the case of heretics, it in no wise
helps his barrenness, because he is not rendered fruitful with his own fruit, but laden with
that of others. But it is possible that some one may flourish in the root of charity, and may
be most rightly minded in the point in which Cyprian was otherwise minded, and yet there
may be more that is fruitful in Cyprian than in him, more that requires purging in him than
in Cyprian. Not only, therefore, do we not compare bad Catholics with the blessed Cyprian,
but even good Catholics we do not hastily pronounce to be on an equality with him whom
our pious mother Church counts among the few rare men of surpassing excellence and
grace, although these others may recognize the baptism of Christ even among heretics, while
he thought otherwise; so that, by the instance of Cyprian, who saw one point less clearly,
and yet remained most firm in the unity of the Church, it might be shown more clearly to
heretics what a sacrilegious crime it was to break the bond of peace. For neither were the
blind Pharisees, although they sometimes enjoined what was right to be done, to be compared
to the Apostle Peter, though he at times enjoined what was not right. But not only is their
dryness not to be compared to his greenness, but even the fruit of others may not be deemed
equal to his fertility. For no one now compels the Gentiles to judaize, and yet no one now
in the Church, however great his progress in goodness, may be compared with the apostleship
of Peter. Wherefore, while rendering due reverence, and paying, so far as I can, the fitting
honor to the peaceful bishop and glorious martyr Cyprian, I yet venture to say that his view
concerning the baptism of schismatics and heretics was contrary to that which was afterwards
brought to light by a decision, not of mine, but of the whole Church, confirmed and
strengthened by the authority of a plenary Council: just as, while paying the reverence he
deserves to Peter, the first of the apostles and most eminent of martyrs, I yet venture to say
that he did not do right in compelling the Gentiles to judaize; for this also, I say, not of my
own teaching, but according to the wholesome doctrine of the Apostle Paul, retained and
preserved through out the whole Church.1587</p>
<p>4. Therefore, in discussing the opinion of Cyprian, though myself of far inferior merit
to Cyprian, I say that good and bad alike can have, can give, can receive the sacrament of
baptism,—the good, indeed, to their health and profit; the bad to their destruction and ruin,—
while the sacrament itself is of equal perfectness in both of them; and that it is of no
consequence to its equal perfectness in all, how much worse the man may be that has it
among the bad, just as it makes no difference how much better he may be that has it among
the good. And accordingly it makes no difference either how much worse he may be that
confers it, as it makes no difference how much better he may be; and so it makes no difference
<note type="footnote">1587 Gal. ii. 14.</note>

<pb n="868"/>
how much worse he may be that receives it, as it makes no difference how much better he
may be. For the sacrament is equally holy, in virtue of its own excellence, both in those who
are unequally just, and in those who are unequally unjust.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">

<head>Chapter 3.</head>
<p>5. But I think that we have sufficiently shown, both from the canon of
Scripture, and from the letters of Cyprian himself, that bad men, while by no means converted
to a better mind, can have, and confer, and receive baptism, of whom it is most clear that
they do not belong to the holy Church of God, though they seem to be within it, inasmuch
as they are covetous, robbers, usurers, envious, evil thinkers, and the like; while she is one
dove,1588 modest and chaste, a bride without spot or wrinkle,1589 a garden enclosed, a
fountain sealed, an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits,1590 with all similar prop-
erties which are attributed to her; and all this can only be understood to be in the good, and
holy, and just,—following, that is, not only the operations of the gifts of God, which are
common to good and bad alike, but also the inner bond of charity conspicuous in those
who have the Holy Spirit, to whom the Lord says, "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained." 1591</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
<pb n="870"/>
<head>Chapter 4.</head>
<p>6. And so it is clear that no good ground is shown herein why the bad man,
who has baptism, may not also confer it; and as he has it to destruction, so he may also
confer it to destruction,—not because this is the character of the thing conferred, nor of the
person conferring, but because it is the character of him on whom it is conferred. For when
a bad man confers it on a good man, that is, on one in the bond of unity, converted with a
true conversion, the wickedness of him who confers it makes no severance between the
good sacrament which is conferred, and the good member of the Church on whom it is
conferred. And when his sins are forgiven him on his true conversion to God, they are
forgiven by those to whom he is united by his true conversion. For the same Spirit forgives
them, which is given to all the saints that cling to one another in love, whether they know
one another in the body or not. Similarly when a man’s sins are retained, they are assuredly
retained by those from whom he, in whom they are retained, separates himself by dissimilarity
of life, and by the turning away of a corrupt heart, whether they know him in the body
or not.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="871"/>
<head>Chapter 5.</head>
<p>7. Wherefore all bad men are separated in the spirit from the good; but if
they are separated in the body also by a manifest dissension, they are made yet worse. But,
as it has been said, it makes no difference to the holiness of baptism how much worse the
man may be that has it, or how much worse he that confers it: yet he that is separated may
confer it, as he that is separated may have it; but as he has it to destruction, so he may confer
it to destruction. But he on whom he confers it may receive it to his soul’s health, if he, on
his part, receive it not in separation; as it has happened to many that, in a catholic spirit,
and with heart not alienated from the unity of peace, they have, under some pressure of
impending death, turned hastily to some heretic and received from him the baptism of
Christ without any share in his perversity, so that, whether dying or restored to life, they by
no means remain in communion with those to whom they never passed in heart. But if the
recipient himself has received the baptism in separation, he receives it so much the more
to his destruction, in proportion to the greatness of the good which he has not received well;
and it tends the more to his destruction in his separation, as it would avail the more to the
salvation of one in unity. And so, if, reforming himself from his perverseness and turning
from his separation, he should come to the Catholic peace, his sins are remitted through
the bond of peace and the same baptism under which his sins were retained through the
sacrilege of separation, because that is always holy both in the just and the unjust, which is
neither increased by the righteousness nor diminished by the unrighteousness of any man.</p>
<p>8. This being the case, what bearing has it on so clear a truth, that many of his fellowbishops
agreed with Cyprian in that opinion, and advanced their own several opinions on
the same side, except that his charity towards the unity of Christ might become more and
more conspicuous? For if he had been the only one to hold that opinion, with no one to
agree with him, he might have been thought, in remaining, to have shrunk from the sin of
schism, because he found no companions in his error; but when so many agreed with him,
he showed, by remaining in unity with the rest who thought differently from him, that he
preserved the most sacred bond of universal catholicity, not from any fear of isolation, but
from the love of peace. Wherefore it might indeed seem now to be superfluous to consider
the several opinions of the other bishops also in that Council; but since those who are slow
in heart think that no answer has been made at all, if to any passage in any discourse the
answer which might be brought to bear on the spot be given not there but somewhere else,
it is better that by reading much they should be polished into sharpness, than that by understanding
little they should have room left for complaining that the argument has not been
fairly conducted.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">

<p>9. First, then, let us record for further consideration the case proposed for
decision by Cyprian himself, with which he initiates the proceedings of the Council, and by
which he shows a peaceful spirit, abounding in the fruitfulness of Christian charity. "Ye
have read," he says, "most beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus, our fellow-bishop, has written
to me, consulting my poor ability about the unlawful and profane baptism of heretics, and
what I have written back to him, expressing to him the same opinion that I have expressed
once and again and often, that heretics coming to the Church ought to be baptized, and
sanctified with the baptism of the Church. Another letter also of Jubaianus has been read
to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere and religious devotion, in answer to our epistle,
he not only expressed his assent to it, but also gratefully acknowledged that he had received
instruction. It remains that we should individually express our opinions on this same subject,
judging no one, and removing no one from the right of communion if he should entertain
a different opinion. For neither does any one of us set himself up as a bishop of bishops, or
by tyrannical terror force his colleagues to the necessity of obeying, since every bishop, in
the free use of his liberty and power, has the right of free judgment, and can no more be
judged by another than he can himself judge another. But we are all awaiting the judgment
of our Lord Jesus Christ who alone has the power both of preferring us in the government
of His Church, and of judging of our actions."1592</p>
<note type="footnote">1592 Conc. Carth., the seventh under Cyprian, A.D. 256. Introduction.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
<pb n="873"/>
<head>Chapter 7.</head>
<p>10. I have already, I think, argued to the best of my power, in the preceding
books, in the interests of Catholic unanimity and counsel, in whose unity these continued
as pious members, in reply not only to the letter which Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus, but also
to that which he sent to Quintus, and that which, in conjunction with certain of his colleagues,
he sent to certain other colleagues, and that which he sent to Pompeius. Wherefore it seems
now to be fitting to consider also what the others severally thought, and that with the liberty
of which he himself would not deprive us, as he says, "Judging no one, nor removing any
from the right of communion if he entertain different opinions." And that he did not say
this with the object of arriving at the hidden thoughts of his colleagues, extracted as it were
from their secret lurking-places, but because he really loved peace and unity, is very easily
to be seen from other passages of the same sort, where he wrote to individuals as to Jubaianus
himself. "These things," he says, "we have written very shortly in answer to you, most beloved
brother, according to our poor ability, not preventing any one of the bishops by our writing
or judgment, from acting as he thinks right, having a free exercise of his own judgment."1593
And that it might not seem that any one, because of his entertaining different opinions in
this same free exercise of his judgment, should be driven from the society of his brethren,
he goes on to say, "We, so far as lies in us, do not strive on behalf of heretics against our
colleagues and fellow-bishops, with whom we maintain godly unity and the peace of our
Lord;"1594 and a little later he says, "Charity of spirit, respect for our fraternity, the bond of
faith, the harmony of the priesthood, are by us maintained with patience and gentleness."1595
And so also in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, when he was asked whether there was
any difference in the efficacy of baptism by sprinkling or by immersion, "In this matter," he
says, "I am too modest and diffident to prevent any one by my judgment from thinking as
he deems right, and acting as he thinks."1596 By which discourses he clearly shows that
these subjects were being handled by them at a time when they were not yet received as decided
beyond all question, but were being investigated with great care as being yet unrevealed.
We, therefore, maintaining on the subject of the identity of all baptisms what must be acknowledged
everywhere to be the custom1597 of the universal Church, and what is confirmed
by the decision of general Councils,1598 and taking greater confidence also from the words

of Cyprian, which allowed me even then to hold opinions differing from his own without
forfeiting the right of communion, seeing that greater importance and praise were attached
to unity, such as the blessed Cyprian and his colleagues, with whom he held that Council,
maintained with those of different opinions, disturbing and overthrowing thereby the
seditious calumnies of heretics and schismatics in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who,
speaking by His apostle, says, "Forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;"1599 and again, by the mouth of the same apostle,
"If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,"1600—we, I say,
propose for consideration and discussion the opinions of the holy bishops, without violating

<p>11. Cæcilius of Bilta1601 said: "I know of one baptism in the one Church
and of none outside the Church. The one will be where there is true hope and sure faith.
For so it is written, ‘One faith, one hope, one baptism.’1602 Not among heretics, where
there is no hope and a false faith; where all things are done by a lie; where one possessed of
a devil exorcises; the question of the sacrament is asked by one from whose mouth and
words proceeds a cancer; the faithless gives faith; the guilty gives pardon for sins and Antichrist
baptizes in the name of Christ; one accursed of God blesses; the dead promises life;
the unpeaceful gives peace; the blasphemer calls on God; the profane administers the
priesthood; the sacrilegious sets up the altar. To all this is added this further evil that the
servant of the devil dares to celebrate the eucharist. If this be not so, let those who stand by
them prove that all of it is false concerning heretics. See the kind of things to which the
Church is compelled to assent, being forced to communicate without baptism or the remission
of sins. This, brethren, we ought to shun and avoid, separating ourselves from so great
a sin, and holding to the one baptism which is granted to the Church alone."1603</p>
<p>12. To this I answer, that all who even within the Church profess that they know God,
but deny Him in their deeds, such as are the covetous and envious, and those who, because
they hate their brethren, are pronounced to be murderers, not on my testimony, but on that
of the holy Apostle John,1604—all these are both devoid of hope, because they have a bad
conscience; and are faithless, because they do not do what they have vowed to God; and liars,
because they make false professions; and possessed of devils, because they give place in their
heart to the devil and his angels; and their words work corruption, since they corrupt good
manners by evil communications; and they are infidels, because they laugh at the threats
which God utters against such men; and accursed, because they live wickedly; and antichrists,
because their lives are opposed to Christ; and cursed of God, since holy Scripture everywhere
calls down curses on such men; and dead, because they are without the life of righteousness;
and unpeaceful, because by their contrary deeds they are at variance with God’s behests;
and blasphemous, because by their abandoned acts despite is done to the name of Christian;
and profane, because they are spiritually shut out from that inner sanctuary of God; and
sacrilegious, because by their evil life they defile the temple of God within themselves; and
servants of the devil, because they do service to fraud and covetousness, which is idolatry.
That of such a kind are some, nay very many, even within the Church, is testified both by

Paul the apostle and by Cyprian the bishop. Why, then, do they baptize? Why also are
some, who "renounce the world in words and not in deeds," baptized without being converted
from a life like this, and not rebaptized when they are converted? And as to what he says
with such indignation, "See the kind of things to which the Church is compelled to assent,
being forced to communicate without baptism or the remission of sins," he could never have
used such expressions had there not been the other bishops who elsewhere forced men to
such things. Whence also it is shown that at that time those men held the truer views who
did not depart from the primitive custom, which is since confirmed by the consent of a
general Council.1605 But what does he mean by adding, "This, brethren, we ought to shun
and avoid, separating ourselves from so great a sin?" For if he means that he is not to do
nor to approve of this, that is another matter; but if he means to condemn and sever from
him those that hold the contrary opinion, he is setting himself against the earlier words of
Cyprian, "Judging no man, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ from
us."</p>

<p>13. The elder Felix1606 of Migirpa said: "I think that every one coming
from heresy should be baptized. For in vain does any one suppose that he has been baptized
there, seeing that there is no baptism save the one true baptism in the Church; for there is
one Lord, and one faith, and one Church, in which rests the one baptism, and holiness, and
the rest. For the things that are practised without have no power to work salvation."</p>
<p>14. To what Felix of Migirpa said we answer as follows. If the one true baptism did not
exist except in the Church, it surely would not exist in those who depart from unity. But it
does exist in them, since they do not receive it when they return, simply because they had
not lost it when they departed. But as regards his statement, that "the things that are practised
without have no power to work salvation," I agree with him, and think that it is quite true;
for it is one thing that baptism should not be there, and another that it should have no power
to work salvation. For when men come to the peace of the Catholic Church, then what was
in them before they joined it, but did not profit them, begins at once to profit them.</p>

<p>15. To the declaration of Polycarp of Adrumetum,1607 that "those who
declare the baptism of heretics to be valid, make ours of none effect," we answer, if that is
the baptism of heretics which is given by heretics, then that is the baptism of the covetous
and murderers which is given by them within the Church. But if this be not their baptism,
neither is the other the baptism of heretics; and so it is Christ’s, by whomsoever it be given.</p>

to be baptized in the unfailing fountain; and that therefore, according to the testimony of

<p>18. Nemesianus of Tubunæ1610 said: "That the baptism which is given
by heretics and schismatics is not true is everywhere declared in the holy Scriptures, inasmuch
as their very prelates are false Christs and false prophets, as the Lord declares by the mouth
of Solomon, ‘Whoso trusteth in lies, the same feedeth the winds; he also followeth flying
birds. For he deserteth the ways of his own vineyard, and hath strayed from the paths of
his own field. For he walketh through pathless and dry places, and a land destined to thirst;
and he gathereth fruitless weeds in his hands.’1611 And again, ‘Abstain from strange water,
and drink not of a strange fountain, that thou mayest live long, and that years may be added
to thy life.’1612 And in the gospel our Lord Jesus Christ spake with His own voice, saying,
‘Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.’1613 This is the Spirit which from the beginning ‘moved upon the face of the waters.’
1614 For neither can the Spirit act without the water, nor the water without the Spirit.
Ill, therefore, for themselves do some interpret, saying that by imposition of hands they receive
the Holy Ghost, and are received into the Church, when it is manifest that they ought
to be born again by both sacraments in the Catholic Church. For then indeed will they be
able to become the sons of God, as the apostle says, ‘Endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one
hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.’1615 All this the Catholic
Church asserts. And again he says in the gospel, ‘That which is born of the flesh is flesh,
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is God, and is born of God.’1616

is born of the Spirit is spirit, since the Holy Ghost, being God, and born of, or proceeding from God, in virtue
of His supreme power makes those to be spirits whom He regenerates. If the meaning had been (as Bishop Fell
takes it), that "he who is born of the Spirit is born of God," the neuter "de Deo natum est" would have been required.
To refer "Spiritus Deus est," with the Benedictines, to John iv. 24, "God is a Spirit," reverses the grammar

of St. Maur (Maranus), p. xxxvi., quoted by Routh, Rel. Sac. iii. 193.</note>

Therefore all things whatsoever all heretics and schismatics do are carnal, as the apostle
says, ‘Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, seditions, heresies,
and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they
which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.’ 1617 The apostle condemns,
equally with all the wicked, those also who cause divisions, that is, schismatics and heretics.
Unless therefore they receive that saving baptism which is one, and found only in the
Catholic Church, they cannot be saved, but will be condemned with the carnal in the judgment
of the Lord."</p>
<p>19. Nemesianus of Tubunæ has advanced many passages of Scripture to prove his point;
but he has in fact said much on behalf of the view of the Catholic Church, which we have
undertaken to set forth and maintain. Unless, indeed, we must suppose that he does not
"trust in what is false" who trusts in the hope of things temporal, as do all covetous men and
robbers, and those "who renounce the world in words but not in deeds," of whom Cyprian
yet bears witness that such men not only baptize, but even are baptized within the
Church.1618 For they themselves also "follow flying birds,"1619 since they do not attain to
what they desire. But not only the heretic, but everyone who leads an evil life "deserteth the
ways of his own vineyard, and hath strayed from the paths of his own field. And he walketh
through pathless and dry places, and a land destined to thirst; and he gathereth fruitless
weeds in his hands;" because all justice is fruitful, and all iniquity is barren. Those, again,
who "drink strange water out of a strange fountain," are found not only among heretics, but
among all who do not live according to the teaching of God, and do live according to the
teaching of the devil. For if he were speaking of baptism, he would not say, "Do not drink
of a strange fountain," but, do not wash thyself in a strange fountain. Again, I do not see at
all what aid he gets towards proving his point from the words of our Lord, "Except a man
be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." 1620 For it is
one thing to say that every one who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven is first born
again of water and the Spirit, because except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, which is the Lord’s saying, and is true; another
thing to say that every one who is born of water and the Spirit shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven, which is assuredly false. For Simon Magus also was born of water and of the
Spirit, 1621 and yet he did not enter into the kingdom of heaven; and this may possibly be

the case with heretics as well. Or if only those are born of the Spirit who are changed with
a true conversion, all "who renounce the world in word and not in deed" are assuredly not
born of the Spirit, but of water only, and yet they are within the Church, according to the
testimony of Cyprian. For we must perforce grant one of two things,—either those who
renounce the world deceitfully are born of the Spirit, though it is to their destruction, not
to salvation, and therefore heretics may be so born; or if what is written, that "the Holy
Spirit of discipline will flee deceit,"1622 extends to proving as much as this, that those who
renounce the world deceitfully are not born of the Spirit, then a man may be baptized with
water, and not born of the Spirit, and Nemesianus says in vain that neither the Spirit can
work without the water, nor the water without the Spirit. Indeed it has been already often
shown how it is possible that men should have one baptism in common who have not one
Church, as it is possible that in the body of the Church herself those who are sanctified by
their righteousness, and those who are polluted through their covetousness, may not have
the same one Spirit, and yet have the same one baptism. For it is said "one body," that is,
the Church, just as it is said "one Spirit" and "one baptism." The other arguments which he
has adduced rather favor our position. For he has brought forward a proof from the gospel,
in the words, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is
spirit; for the Spirit is God, and born of God;"1623 and he has advanced the argument that
therefore all things that are done by any heretic or schismatic are carnal, as the apostle says,
"The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness;" and so he
goes through the list which the apostle there enumerates, amongst which he has reckoned
heresies, since "they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."1624 Then
he goes on to add, that "therefore the apostle condemns with all wicked men those also who
cause division, that is, schismatics and heretics." And in this he does well, that when he
enumerates the works of the flesh, among which are also heresies, he found and declared
that the apostle condemns them all alike. Let him therefore question the holy Cyprian
himself, and learn from him how many even within the Church live according to the evil
works of the flesh, which the apostle condemns in common with the heresies, and yet these
both baptize and are baptized. Why then are heretics alone said to be incapable of possessing
baptism, which is possessed by the very partners in their condemnation?</p>

<p>22. Lucius of Castra Galbæ1627 said: "Since the Lord hath said in His
gospel, ‘Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savor, that which is salted
from it shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under
foot of men;’1628 and seeing that again, after His resurrection, when sending forth His
apostles, He commanded them, saying, ‘All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth:
go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost,’1629—since then it is plain that heretics, that is, the enemies of
Christ, have not the full confession of the sacrament, also that schismatics cannot reason
with spiritual wisdom, since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their savor
from the Church, which is one, have become contrary to it,1630 let that be done which is
written, ‘The houses of those that are opposed to the law must needs be cleansed;’1631 and
it therefore follows that those who have been polluted by being baptized by men opposed
to Christ should first be cleansed, and only then baptized."1632</p>
<p>23. Lucius of Castra Galbæ has brought forward a proof from the gospel, in the words
of the Lord, "Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savor, that which is
salted from it shall be good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of
men;" just as though we maintained that men when cast out were of any profit for the salvation
either of themselves or of any one else. But those also who, though seeming to be
within, are yet of such a kind, not only are without spiritually, but will in the end be separated
in the body also. For all such are for nothing. But it does not therefore follow that the sacrament
of baptism which is in them is nothing. For even in the very men who are cast out,
if they return to their senses and come back, the salvation which had departed from them
returns; but the baptism does not return, because it never had departed. And in what the
Lord says, "Go therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," He did not permit any to baptize except the good,
inasmuch as He did not say to the bad, "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained."1633 How then do the wicked
baptize within, who cannot remit sins? How also is it that they baptize the wicked whose

hearts are not changed, whose sins are yet upon them, as John says, "He that hateth his
brother is in darkness even until now?"1634 But if the sins of these men are remitted when
they join themselves in the close bonds of love to the good and just, through whom sins are
remitted in the Church, though they have been baptized by the wicked, so the sins of those
also are remitted who come from without and join themselves by the inner bond of peace
to the same framework of the body of Christ. Yet the baptism of Christ should be acknowledged
in both, and held invalid in none, whether before they are converted, though then
it profit them nothing, or after they are converted, that so it may profit them, as he says,
"Since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their savor from the Church,
which is one, have become contrary to it, let that be done which is written, ‘The houses of
those that are opposed to the law must need be cleansed.’ And it therefore follows," he goes
on to say, "that those who have been polluted by being baptized by men opposed to Christ
should first be cleansed, and only then baptized." What then? Are thieves and murderers
not contrary to the law, which says, "Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal?"1635 "They
must therefore needs be cleansed." Who will deny it? And yet not only those who are baptized
by such within the Church, but also those who, being such themselves, are baptized
without being changed in heart, are nevertheless exempt from further baptism when they
are so changed. So great is the force of the sacrament of mere baptism, that though we allow
that a man who has been baptized and continues to lead an evil life requires to be cleansed,
we yet forbid him to be any more baptized.</p>

<p>24. Crescens of Cirta1636 said: "The letters of our most beloved Cyprian
to Jubaianus, and also to Stephen,1637 having been read in so large an assembly of our most
holy brethren in the priesthood, containing as they do so large a body of sacred testimony
derived from the Scriptures that give us our God,1638 that we have every reason to assent
to them, being all united by the grace of God, I give my judgment that all heretics or schismatics
who wish to come to the Catholic Church should not enter therein unless they have
been first exorcised and baptized; with the obvious exception of those who have been originally
baptized in the Catholic Church, these being reconciled and admitted to the penance
of the Church by the imposition of hands."1639</p>
<p>25. Here we are warned once more to inquire why he says, "Except, of course, those
who have been originally baptized in the Catholic Church." Is it because they had not lost
what they had before received? Why then could they not also transmit outside the Church
what they were able to possess outside? Is it that outside it is unlawfully transmitted? But
neither is it lawfully possessed outside, and yet it is possessed; so it is unlawfully given outside,
but yet it is given. But what is given to the person returning from heresy who had been
baptized inside, is given to the person coming to the Church who had been baptized outside,—
that is, that he may have lawfully inside what before he had unlawfully outside. But
perhaps some one may ask what was said on this point in the letter of the blessed Cyprian
to Stephen, which is mentioned in this judgment, though not in the opening address to the
Council,—I suppose because it was not considered necessary. For Crescens stated that the
letter itself had been read in the assembly, which I have no doubt was done, if I am not
mistaken, as is customary, in order that the bishops, being already assembled, might receive
some information at the same time on the subject contained in that letter. For it certainly
has no bearing on the present subject; and I am more surprised at Crescens having thought
fit to mention it at all, than at its having been passed over in the opening address. But if
any one thinks that I have shrunk from bringing forward something which has been urged
in it that is essential to the present point, let him read it and see that what I say is true; or if
he finds it otherwise, let him convict me of falsehood. For that letter contains nothing
whatsoever about baptism administered among heretics or schismatics, which is the subject
of our present argument.1640</p>

<p>27. The answer to which is: The judgment of the whole Catholic Church is that heretics,
being already baptized with the baptism of Christ, although in heresy, should not be rebaptized

<p>28. Monnulus of Girba1643 said: "The truth of our mother, the Catholic
Church, hath continued, and still continues among us, brethren, especially in the threefold
nature1644 of baptism, as our Lord says, ‘Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.’1645 Since, therefore," he goes on to say, "we know
clearly that heretics have neither Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost, they ought, on coming to
our mother, the Church, to be truly regenerated and baptized, that the cancer which they
had, and the wrath of condemnation, and the destructive energy of error1646 may be sanctified
by the holy and heavenly laver."1647</p>
<p>29. To this we answer, That all who are baptized with the baptism that is consecrated
in the words of the gospel have the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost in the sacrament
alone; but that in heart and in life neither do those have them who live an abandoned and
accursed life within.</p>

<p>30. Secundinus of Cedias1648 said: "Since our Lord Christ said, ‘He that
is not with me is against me,’1649 and the Apostle John declares those who go out from the
Church to be antichrists,1650 without all doubt the enemies of Christ, and those who are
called antichrists, cannot minister the grace of the baptism which gives salvation; and
therefore my judgment is that those who take refuge in the Church from the snares of heresy
should be baptized by us, who of His condescension are called the friends of God."1651</p>
<p>31. The answer to which is, That all are the opponents of Christ, to whom, on their
saying, "Lord, have we not in Thy name done many wonderful things?" with all the rest that
is there recorded, He shall at the last day answer, "I never knew you: depart from me, ye
that work iniquity,"1652—all which kind of chaff is destined for the fire, if it persevere to the
last in its wickedness, whether any part of it fly outside before its winnowing, or whether it
seem to be within. If, therefore, those heretics who come to the Church are to be again
baptized, that they may be baptized by the friends of God, are those covetous men, those
robbers, murderers, the friends of God, or must those whom they have baptized be baptized
afresh?</p>

<p>32. Felix of Bagai1653 said: "As when the blind leads the blind, both fall
into the ditch,1654 so when a heretic baptizes a heretic, both fall together into death."</p>
<p>33. This is true, but it does not follow that what he adds is true. "And therefore," he
says, "the heretic must be baptized and brought to life, lest we who are alive should hold
communion with the dead."1655 Were they not dead who said, "Let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die?"1656 for they did not believe in the resurrection of the dead. Those then
who were corrupted by their evil communications, and followed them, were not they likewise
falling with them into the pit? And yet among them there were men to whom the apostle
was writing as being already baptized; nor would they, therefore, if they were corrected, be
baptized afresh. Does not the same apostle say, "To be carnally-minded is death?"1657 and
certainly the covetous, the deceivers, the robbers, in the midst of whom Cyprian himself
was groaning, were carnally-minded. What then? Did the dead hurt him who was living
in unity? Or who would say, that because such men had or gave the baptism of Christ, that
it was therefore violated by their iniquities?</p>

<p>36. Theogenes of Hippo Regius1660 said: "According to the sacrament
of the heavenly grace of God which we have received, we believe in the one only baptism
which is in the holy Church."1661</p>
<p>37. This may be my own judgment also. For it is so balanced, that it contains nothing
contrary to the truth. For we also believe in the one only baptism which is in the holy
Church. Had he said, indeed, We believe in that which is in the holy Church alone, the
same answer must have been made to him as to the rest. But as it is, since he has expressed
himself in this wise, "We believe in the one only baptism which is in the holy Church," so
that it is asserted that it exists in the holy Church, but not denied that it may be elsewhere
as well, whatever his meaning may have been, there is no need to argue against these words.
For if I were questioned on the several points, first, whether there was one baptism, I should
answer that there was one. Then if I were asked, whether this was in the holy Church, I
should answer that it was. In the third place, if it were asked whether I believed in this
baptism, I should answer that I did so believe; and consequently I should answer that I believed
in the one baptism which is in the holy Church. But if it were asked whether it was
found in the holy Church alone, and not among heretics and schismatics, I should answer
that, in common with the whole Church, I believed the contrary. But since he did not insert
this in his judgment, I should consider that it was mere wantonness if I added words which
I did not find there, for the sake of arguing against them. For if he were to say, There is one
water of the river Euphrates, which is in Paradise, no one could gainsay the truth of what
he said. But if he were asked whether that water were in Paradise and nowhere else, and
were to say that this was so, he would be saying what was false. For, besides Paradise, it is
also in those lands into which it flows from that source. But who is rash enough to say that
he would have been likely to assert what is false, when it is quite possible that he was asserting
what is true? Wherefore the words of this judgment require no contradiction, because they
in no wise run counter to the truth.</p>

<p>38. Dativus of Badiæ1662 said "We, so far as lies within our power, refuse
to communicate with a heretic, unless he has been baptized in the Church, and received
remission of his sins."1663</p>
<p>39. The answer to this is: If your reason for wishing him to be baptized is that he has
not received remission of sins, supposing you find a man within the Church who has been
baptized, though entertaining hatred towards his brother, since the Lord cannot lie, who
says, "If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,"
1664 will you bid such an one, when corrected, to be baptized afresh? Assuredly not;
so neither should you bid the heretic. It is clear that we must not pass unnoticed why he
did not briefly say, "We do not communicate with a heretic," but added, "so far as lies within
our power." For he saw that a greater number agreed with this view, from whose communion,
however, he and his friends could not separate themselves, lest unity should be impaired,
and so he added, "so far as lies within our power,"—showing beyond all doubt that he did
not willingly communicate with those whom he held to be without baptism, but that yet all
things were to be endured for the sake of peace and unity; just as was done also by those
who thought that Dativus and his party were in the wrong, and who held what afterwards
was taught by a fuller declaration of the truth, and urged by ancient custom, which received
the stronger confirmation of a later Council; yet in turn, with anxious piety, they showed
toleration towards each other, though without violation of Christian charity they entertained
different opinions, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,1665 till
God should reveal to one of them, were he otherwise minded, even this error of his ways.1666
And to this I would have those give heed, by whom unity is attacked on the authority of this
very Council by which it is declared how much unity should be loved.</p>

<p>40. Successus of Abbir Germaniciana1667 said: "Heretics may either do
nothing or everything. If they can baptize, they can also give the Holy Spirit; but if they
cannot give the Holy Spirit, because they do not possess the Holy Spirit, then can they not
either spiritually baptize. Therefore we give our judgment that heretics should be baptized."
1668</p>
<p>41. To this we may answer almost word for word: Murderers may either do nothing
or everything. If they can baptize, they can also give the Holy Spirit; but if they cannot give
the Holy Spirit, because they do not possess the Holy Spirit, then can they not either spiritually
baptize. Therefore we give our judgment that persons baptized by murderers, or murderers
themselves who have been baptized without being converted, should, when they have
corrected themselves, be baptized. Yet this is not true. For "whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer;"1669 and Cyprian knew such men within the Church, who certainly baptized.
Therefore it is to no purpose that words of this sort are used concerning heretics.</p>

<p>42. Fortunatus of Thuccabori1670 said: "Jesus Christ our Lord and God,
the Son of God the Father and Creator, built His Church upon a rock, not upon heresy, and
gave the power of baptizing to bishops, not to heretics. Wherefore those who are outside
the Church, and stand against Christ, scattering His sheep and flock, cannot baptize outside."
1671</p>
<p>43. He added the word "outside" in order that he might not be answered with a like
brevity to Successus. For otherwise he might also have been answered word for word: Jesus
Christ our Lord and God, the Son of God the Father and Creator, built His Church upon a
rock, not upon iniquity, and gave the power of baptizing to bishops, not to the unrighteous.
Wherefore those who do not belong to the rock on which they build, who hear the word of
God and do it, 1672 but, living contrary to Christ in hearing the word and not doing it, and
hereby building on the sand, in this way scatter His sheep and flock by the example of an
abandoned character, cannot baptize. Might not this be said with all the semblance of truth?
and yet it is false. For the unrighteous do baptize, since those robbers are unrighteous whom
Cyprian maintained to be at unity with himself.1673 But for this reason, says the Donatist,
he adds "outside." Why therefore can they not baptize outside? Is it because they are worse
from the very fact that they are outside? But it makes no difference, in respect of the validity
of baptism, how much worse the minister may be. For there is not so much difference
between bad and worse as between good and bad; and yet, when the bad baptizes, he gives
the selfsame sacrament as the good. Therefore, also, when the worse baptizes, he gives the
selfsame sacrament as the less bad. Or is it that it is not in respect of man’s merit, but of
the sacrament of baptism itself, that it cannot be given outside? If this were so, neither could
it be possessed outside, and it would be necessary that a man should be baptized again so
often as he left the Church and again returned to it.</p>
<p>44. Further, if we inquire more carefully what is meant by "outside," especially as he
himself makes mention of the rock on which the Church is built, are not they in the Church
who are on the rock, and they who are not on the rock, not in the Church either? Now,
therefore, let us see whether they build their house upon a rock who hear the words of Christ
and do them not. The Lord Himself declares the contrary, saying, "Whosoever heareth these
sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
upon a rock;" and a little later, "Every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand."1674

If, therefore, the Church is on a rock, those who are on the sand, because they are outside
the rock, are necessarily outside the Church. Let us recollect, therefore, how many Cyprian
mentions as placed within who build upon the sand, that is, who hear the words of Christ
and do them not. And therefore, because they are on the sand, they are proved to be outside
the rock, that is, outside the Church; yet even while they are so situated, and are either not
yet or never changed for the better, not only do they baptize and are baptized, but the baptism
which they have remains valid in them though they are destined to damnation.</p>
<p>45. Neither can it be said in this place,1675 Yet who is there that doeth all the words of
the Lord which are written in the evangelic sermon itself,1676 at the end of which He says,
that he who heard the said words and did them built upon a rock, and he who heard them
and did them not built upon the sand? For, granting that by certain persons all the words
are not accomplished, yet in the same sermon He has appointed the remedy, saying, "Forgive,
and ye shall be forgiven."1677 And after the Lord’s prayer had been recorded in detail in the
same sermon, He says, "For I say unto you, if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly
Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses."1678 Hence also Peter says, "For charity shall cover the
multitude of sins;"1679 which charity they certainly did not have, and on this account they
built upon the sand, of whom the same Cyprian says, that within the Church they held
conversation, even in the time of the apostles, in unkindly hatred alien from Christian
charity;1680 and therefore they seemed indeed to be within, but really were without, because
they were not on that rock by which the Church is signified.</p>

<p>46. Sedatus of Tuburbo1681 said: "Inasmuch as water, sanctified by the
prayer of the priest in the Church, washes away sins, just so much does it multiply sins when
infected, as by a cancer, with the words of heretics. Wherefore one must strive, with all such
efforts as conduce to peace, that no one who has been infected and tainted by heretical error
should refuse to receive the one true baptism, with which whosoever is not baptized shall
not inherit the kingdom of heaven."1682</p>
<p>47. To this we answer, that if the water is not sanctified, when through want of skill the
priest who prays utters some words of error, many, not only of the bad, but of the good
brethren in the Church itself, fail to sanctify the water. For the prayers of many are corrected
every day on being recited to men of greater learning, and many things are found in them
contrary to the Catholic faith. Supposing, then, that it were shown that some persons were
baptized when these prayers had been uttered over the water, will they be bidden to be
baptized afresh? Why not? Because generally the fault in the prayer is more than counterbalanced
by the intent of him who offers it; and those fixed words of the gospel, without
which baptism cannot be consecrated, are of such efficacy, that, by their virtue, anything
faulty that is uttered in the prayer contrary to the rule of faith is made of no effect, just as
the devil is excluded by the name of Christ. For it is clear that if a heretic utters a faulty
prayer, he has no good intent of love whereby that want of skill may be compensated, and
therefore he is like any envious or spiteful person in the Catholic Church itself, such as
Cyprian proves to exist within the Church. Or one might offer some prayer, as not unfrequently
happens, in which he should speak against the rule of faith, since many rush into
the use of prayers which are composed not only by unskillful men who love to talk, but even
by heretics, and in the simplicity of ignorance, not being able to discern their true character,
use them, thinking they are good; and yet what is erroneous in them does not vitiate what
is right, but rather it is rendered null thereby, just as in the man of good hope and approved
faith, who yet is but a man, if in anything he be otherwise minded, what he holds aright is
not thereby vitiated until God reveal to him also that in which he is otherwise minded. 1683
But supposing that the man himself is wicked and perverse, then, if he should offer an upright
prayer, in no part contrary to the Catholic faith, it does not follow that because the prayer
is right the man himself is also right; and if over some he offer an erroneous prayer, God is
present to uphold the words of His gospel, without which the baptism of Christ cannot be
consecrated, and He Himself consecrates His sacrament, that in the recipient, either before
he is baptized, or when he is baptized, or at some future time when he turns in truth to God,

that very sacrament may be profitable to salvation, which, were he not to be converted,
would be powerful to his destruction. But who is there who does not know that there is no
baptism of Christ, if the words of the gospel in which consists the outward visible sign be
not forthcoming? But you will more easily find heretics who do not baptize at all, than any
who baptize without those words. And therefore we say, not that every baptism (for in
many of the blasphemous rites of idols men are said to be baptized), but that the baptism
of Christ, that is, every baptism consecrated in the words of the gospel, is everywhere the
same, and cannot be vitiated by any perversity on the part of any men.1684</p>
<p>48. We must certainly not lightly pass over in this judgment that he here inserted a
clause, and says, "Wherefore we must strive, with all such efforts as conduce to peace, that
no one who has been infected," etc. For he had regard to those words of the blessed Cyprian
in his opening speech, "Judging no man, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he
entertain a different view." See of what power is the love of unity and peace in the good
sons of the Church, that they should choose rather to show tolerance towards those whom
they called sacrilegious and profane, being admitted, as they thought, without the sacrament
of baptism, if they could not correct them as they thought was right, than on their account
to break that holy bond, lest on account of the tares the wheat also should be rooted
out,1685—permitting, so far as rested with them, as in that noblest judgment of Solomon,
that the infant body should rather be nourished by the false mother than be cut in pieces.1686
But this was the opinion both of those who held the truer view about the sacrament of
baptism, and of those to whom God, in consideration of their great love, was purposing to
reveal any point in which they were otherwise minded.</p>

<p>49. Privatianus of Sufetula1687 said: "He who says that heretics have the
power of baptizing should first say who it was that founded heresy. For if heresy is of God,
it may have the divine favor; but if it be not of God, how can it either have or confer on any
one the grace of God?"1688</p>
<p>50. This man may thus be answered word for word: He who says that malicious and
envious persons have the power of baptizing, should first say who was the founder of malice
and envy. For if malice and envy are of God, they may have the divine favor; but if they are
not of God, how can they either have or confer on any one the grace of God? But as these
words are in the same way most manifestly false, so are also those which these were uttered
to confute. For the malicious and envious baptize, as even Cyprian himself allows, because
he bears testimony that they also are within. So therefore even heretics may baptize, because
baptism is the sacrament of Christ; but envy and heresy are the works of the devil. Yet
though a man possesses them, he does not thereby cause that if he have the sacrament of
Christ, it also should itself be reckoned in the number of the devil’s works.</p>

we only know in the Church. Or how can those baptize any one in the name of Christ whom
Christ Himself declares to be His enemies?"1692</p>
<p>54. Giving answer to this man in a like tenor of words, we say: Let those who uphold
or favor the unrighteous see to it: we recall to the Church when we can the one baptism
which we know to be of the Church alone, wherever it be found. Or how can they baptize
any one in the name of Christ whom Christ Himself declares to be His enemies? For He
says to all the unrighteous, "I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity;" 1693

<p>55. Cassius of Macomades1695 said: "Since there cannot be two baptisms,
he who grants baptism unto heretics takes it away from himself. I therefore declare my
judgment that heretics, those objects for our tears, those masses of corruption,1696 should
be baptized when they begin to come to the Church, and that so being washed by the sacred
and divine laver, and enlightened with the light of life, they may be received into the
Church,—as being now made not enemies, but peaceful; not strangers, but of the household
of the faith of the Lord; not bastards,1697 but sons of God; partaking not of error, but of
salvation,—with the exception of those who, being believers transplanted from the Church,
had gone over to heresy, and that these should be restored by the laying on of hands."1698</p>
<p>56. Another might say: Since there cannot be two baptisms, he who grants baptism to
the unrighteous takes it away from himself. But even our opponents would join us in resisting
such a man when he says that we grant baptism to the unrighteous, which is not of the unrighteous,
like their unrighteousness, but of Christ, of whom is righteousness, and whose
sacrament, even among the unrighteous, is not unrighteous. What, therefore, they would
join us in saying of the unrighteous, that let them say to themselves of heretics. And therefore
he should rather have said as follows: I therefore give my judgment that heretics, those objects
for our tears, those masses of corruption, should not be baptized when they begin to come
to the Church, if they already have the baptism of Christ, but should be corrected from their
error. For we may similarly say of the unrighteous, of whom the heretics are a part: I
therefore give my judgment that the unrighteous, those objects for our tears, and masses of
corruption, if they have been already baptized, should not be baptized again when they begin
to come to the Church, that is, to that rock outside which are all who hear the words of
Christ and do them not; but being already washed with the sacred and divine laver, and
now further enlightened with the light of truth, should be received into the Church no longer
as enemies but as peaceful, for the unrighteous have no peace; no longer as strangers, but
of the household of the faith of the Lord, for to the unrighteous it is said, "How then art
thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?"1699 no longer as bastards,

but the sons of God, for the unrighteous are the sons of the devil, partaking not of error but
of salvation, for un-righteousness cannot save. And by the Church I mean that rock, that
dove, that garden enclosed and fountain sealed, which is recognized only in the wheat, not
in the chaff, whether that be scattered far apart by the wind, or appear to be mingled with
the corn even till the last winnowing. In vain, therefore, did Cassius add, "With the exception
of those who, being believers transplanted from the Church, had gone over to heresy." For
if even they themselves had lost baptism by seceding, to themselves also let it be restored;
but if they had not lost it, let what was given by them receive due recognition.</p>

<p>57. Another Januarius of Vicus Cæsaris1700 said: "If error does not obey
truth, much more does truth refuse assent to error; and therefore we stand by the Church
in which we preside, so that, claiming her baptism for herself alone, we baptize those whom
the Church has not baptized."1701</p>
<p>58. We answer: Whom the Church baptizes, those that rock baptizes outside which
are all they who hear the words of Christ and do them not. Let all, therefore, be baptized
again who have been baptized by such. But if this is not done, then, as we recognize the
baptism of Christ in these, so should we recognize it in heretics, though we either condemn
or correct their unrighteousness and error.</p>

<p>59. Another Secundinus of Carpis1702 said: "Are heretics Christians or
not? If they are Christians, why are they not in the Church of God? If they are not Christians,
let them be made so.1703 Else what will be the reference in the discourse of the Lord, in
which He says, ‘He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me
scattereth abroad?’1704 Whence it is clear that on strange children and the offspring of
Antichrist the Holy Spirit cannot descend by the laying on of hands alone, since it is clear
that heretics have not baptism."1705</p>
<p>60. To this we answer: Are the unrighteous Christians or not? If they are Christians,
why are they not on that rock on which the Church is built? for they hear the words of Christ
and do them not. If they are not Christians, let them be made so. Else what will be the reference
in the discourse of our Lord, in which He says, "He that is not with me is against me;
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad?" For they scatter His sheep who lead
them to the ruin of their lives by a false imitation of the Lord. Whence it is clear that upon
strange children (as all the unrighteous are called), and upon the offspring of Antichrist
(which all are who oppose themselves to Christ), the Holy Spirit cannot descend by the
laying on of hands alone, if there be not added a true conversion of the heart; since it is clear
that the unrighteous, so long as they are unrighteous, may indeed have baptism, but cannot
have the salvation of which baptism is the sacrament. For let us see whether heretics are
described in that psalm where the following words are used of strange children: "Deliver
me, O Lord, from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their
right hand is a right hand of falsehood: whose sons are like young shoots well established,
and their daughters polished after the similitude of the temple. Their garners are full, affording
all manner of store; their sheep are fruitful, bringing forth plenteously in their streets;
their oxen are strong: there is no breaking down of their fence, no opening of a passage out,
no complaining in their streets. Men deemed happy the people that is in such a case; rather
blessed is the people whose God is the Lord."1706 If, therefore, those are strange children
who place their happiness in temporal things, and in the abundance of earthly prosperity,
and despise the commandments of the Lord, let us see whether these are not the very same

of whom Cyprian so speaks, transforming them also into himself, that he may show that he
is speaking of men with whom he held communion in the sacraments: "In not keeping," he
says, "the way of the Lord, nor observing the heavenly commandments given us for our
salvation. Our Lord did the will of His Father, and we do not do the will of the Lord, being
eager about our patrimony or our gains, following after pride, and so forth."1707 But if these
could both have and transmit baptism, why is it denied that it may exist among strange
children, whom he yet exhorts, that, by keeping the heavenly commandments conveyed to
them through the only-begotten Son, they should deserve to be His brethren and the sons
of God?</p>

<p>61. Victoricus of Thabraca1708 said: "If heretics may baptize, and give
remission of sins, why do we destroy their credit, and call them heretics?"1709
62. What if another were to say: If the unrighteous may baptize, and give remission of
sins, why do we destroy their credit, and call them unrighteous? The answer which we
should give to such an one concerning the unrighteous may also be given to the other concerning
heretics,—that is, in the first place, that the baptism with which they baptize is not
theirs; and secondly, that it does not follow that whosoever has the baptism of Christ is also
certain of the remission of his sins if he has this only in the outward sign, and is not converted
with a true conversion of the heart, so that he who gives remission should himself have remission
of his sins.</p>

<p>63. Another Felix of Uthina1710 said: "No one can doubt, most holy
brethren in the priesthood, that human presumption has not so much power as the adorable
and venerable majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ. Remembering then the danger, we ought
not only to observe this ourselves, but to confirm it by our general consent, that all heretics
who come to the bosom of our mother the Church be baptized, that the heretical mind,
which has been polluted by long-continued corruption, may be reformed when cleansed by
the sanctification of the laver."1711</p>
<p>64. Perhaps the man who has placed the strength of his case for the baptizing of heretics
in the cleansing away of the long-continued corruption, would spare those who, having
fallen headlong into some heresy, had remained in it a brief space, and presently being
corrected, had passed from thence to the Catholic Church. Furthermore, he has himself
failed to observe that it might be said that all unrighteous persons who come to that rock,
in which is understood the Church, should be baptized, so that the unrighteous mind, which
was building outside the rock upon the sand by hearing the words of Christ and not doing
them, might be reformed when cleansed by the sanctification of the laver; and yet this is not
done if they have been baptized already, even if it be proved that such was their character
when they were baptized, that is, that they "renounced the world in words and not in deeds."</p>

<p>65. Quietus of Burug1712 said: "We who live by faith ought with believing
observance to obey what has been before foretold for our instruction. For it is written in
Solomon, ‘He that is washed by one dead, what availeth his washing?’1713 Which assuredly
he says of those who are washed by heretics, and of those who wash. For if they who are
baptized among them receive eternal life through the remission of their sins, why do they
come to the Church? But if no salvation is received from a dead person, and they therefore,
acknowledging their former error, return with penance to the truth, they ought to be sanctified
with the one life-giving baptism which is in the Catholic Church." 1714</p>
<p>66. What it is to be baptized by the dead, we have already, without prejudice to the
more careful consideration of the same scripture, sufficiently declared before.1715 But I
would ask why it is that they wish heretics alone to be considered dead, when Paul the apostle
has said generally of sin, "The wages of sin is death;"1716 and again, "To be carnally minded
is death."1717 And when he says that a widow that liveth in pleasure is dead,1718 how are
they not dead "who renounce the world in words and not in deeds"? What, therefore, is the
profit of washing in him who is baptized by them, except, indeed, that if he himself also is
of the same character, he has the laver indeed, but it does not profit him to salvation? But
if he by whom he is baptized is such, but the man who is baptized is turned to the Lord with
no false heart, he is not baptized by that dead person, but by that living One of whom it is
said, "The same is He which baptizeth."1719 But to what he says of heretics, that if they who
are baptized among them receive eternal life through the remission of their sins, why do
they come to the Church? we answer: They come for this reason, that although they have
received the baptism of Christ up to the point of the celebration of the sacrament, yet they
cannot attain to life eternal save through the charity of unity; just as neither would those
envious and malicious ones attain to life eternal, who would not have their sins forgiven
them, even if they entertained hatred only against those from whom they suffered wrong;
since the Truth said, "If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive
your trespasses,"1720 how much less when they were hating those towards whom they were

rewarding evil for good?1721 And yet these men, though "renouncing the world in words
and not in deeds," would not be baptized again, if they should afterwards be corrected, but
they would be made holy by the one living baptism. And this is indeed in the Catholic
Church, but not in it alone, as neither is it in the saints alone who are built upon the rock,

<p>67. Castus of Sicca1723 said: He who presumes to follow custom in despite
of truth is either envious and evilly disposed towards the brethren to whom the truth is revealed,
or else he is ungrateful towards God, by whose inspiration His Church is instructed."
1724</p>
<p>68. If this man proved that those who differed from him, and held the view that has
since been held by the whole world under the sanction of a Christian Council, were following
custom so as to despise truth, we should have reason for fearing these words; but seeing that
this custom is found both to have had its origin in truth and to have been confirmed by
truth, we have nothing to fear in this judgment. And yet, if they were envious or evilly disposed
towards the brethren, or ungrateful towards God, see with what kind of men they
were willing to hold communion; see what kind of men, holding different opinions from
their own, they treated as Cyprian enjoined them at the first, not removing them from the
right of communion; see by what kind of men they were not polluted in the preservation of
unity; see how greatly the bond of peace was to be loved; see what views they hold who bring
charges against us, founded on the Council of bishops, their predecessors, whose example
they do not imitate, and by whose example, when the rights of the case are considered, they
are condemned. If it was the custom, as this judgment bears witness, that heretics coming
to the Church should be received with the baptism which they already had, either this was
done rightly, or the evil do not pollute the good in unity. If it was rightly done, why do they
accuse the world because they are so received? But if the evil do not pollute the good in
unity, how do they defend themselves against the charge of sacrilegious separation?</p>

the rule of the law of the Church, saying, ‘Go ye, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.’1726 Therefore the false and
unrighteous baptism of heretics is to be repudiated by us, and contradicted with all solemnity
of witness, seeing that from their mouth issues not life, but poison, not heavenly grace, but
blaspheming of the Trinity. And so it is plain that heretics coming to the Church ought to
be baptized with perfect and Catholic baptism, that, being purified from the blasphemy of
their presumption, they may be reformed by the grace of the Holy Spirit." 1727</p>
<p>70. Clearly, if the baptism is not consecrated in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost, it should be considered to be of the heretics, and repudiated as unrighteous
by us with all solemnity of witness; but if we discern this name in it, we do better
to distinguish the words of the gospel from heretical error, and approve what is sound in
them, correcting what is faulty.</p>

<p>71. Libosus of Vaga1728 said: "The Lord says in the gospel, ‘I am the
truth;’1729 He did not say, I am custom. Therefore, when the truth is made manifest, let
custom yield to truth; so that, if even in time past any one did not baptize heretics in the
Church, he may now begin to baptize them."1730</p>
<p>72. Here he has in no way tried to show how that is the truth to which he says that
custom ought to yield. But it is of more importance that he helps us against those who have
separated themselves from unity, by confessing that the custom existed, than that he thinks
it ought to yield to a truth which he does not show. For the custom is of such a nature, that
if it admitted sacrilegious men to the altar of Christ without the cleansing of baptism, and
polluted none of the good men who remained in unity, then all who have cut themselves
off from the same unity, in which they could not be polluted by the contagion of any evil
persons whatsoever, have separated themselves without reason, and have committed the
manifest sacrilege of schism. But if all perished in pollution through that custom, from
what cavern do they issue without the original truth, and with all the cunning of calumny?
If, however, the custom was a right one by which heretics were thus received, let them
abandon their madness, let them confess their error; let them come to the Catholic Church,
not that they may be bathed again with the sacrament of baptism, but that they may be cured
from the wound of severance.</p>

<p>77. Also another Felix of Ammacura1736 said: "I too, following the authority
of the holy Scriptures, give my judgment that heretics should be baptized, and with
them those also who maintain that they have been baptized among schismatics. For if, according
to the warning of Christ, our fountain is sealed to ourselves,1737 let all the enemies
of our Church understand that it cannot belong to others; nor can He who is the Shepherd
of our flock give the water unto salvation to two different peoples. And therefore it is clear
that neither heretics nor schismatics can receive anything heavenly, who dare to accept from
men that are sinners and aliens from the Church. When the giver has no ground to stand
upon, surely neither can the receiver derive any profit."1738</p>
<p>78. To him we answer, that the holy Scriptures nowhere have enjoined that heretics
baptized among heretics should be baptized afresh, but that they have shown in many places
that all are aliens from the Church who are not on the rock, nor belong to the members of
the dove, and yet that they baptize and are baptized and have the sacrament of salvation
without salvation. But how our fountain is like the fountain of Paradise, in that, like it, it
flows forth even beyond the bounds of Paradise, has been sufficiently set forth above;1739
and that "He who is the Shepherd of our flock cannot give the water unto salvation to two
different peoples," that is, to one that is His own, and to another that is alien, I fully agree
in admitting. But does it follow that because the water is not unto salvation it is not the
identical water? For the water of the deluge was for salvation unto those who were placed
within the ark, but it brought death to those without, and yet it was the same water. And
many aliens, that is to say, envious persons, whom Cyprian declares and proves from
Scripture to be of the party of the devil, seem as it were to be within, and yet, if they were
not without the ark, they would not perish by water. For such men are slain by baptism, as
the sweet savor of Christ was unto death to those of whom the apostle speaks.1740 Why
then do not either heretics or schismatics receive anything heavenly, just as thorns or tares,
like those who were without the ark received indeed the rain from the floods of heaven, but
to destruction, not to salvation? And so I do not take the pains to refute what he said in
conclusion: "When the giver has no ground to stand upon, surely neither can the receiver
derive any profit," since we also say that it does not profit the receivers while they receive it
in heresy, consenting with the heretics; and therefore they come to Catholic peace and unity,
not that they may receive baptism, but that what they had received may begin to profit them.</p>

acknowledge that there is one baptism, all do not understand the unity of the same baptism.
For the Church and heresy are two distinct things. If heretics have baptism we have it not;
but if we have it, heretics cannot have it. But there is no doubt that the Church alone possesses
the baptism of Christ, since it alone possesses both the favor and the truth of
Christ."1742</p>
<p>80. Another might equally say, and say with equal want of truth: I wonder that, while
all confess there is one baptism, all do not understand the unity of baptism. For righteousness
and unrighteousness are two distinct things. If the unrighteous have baptism, the righteous
have it not; but if the righteous have it, the unrighteous cannot have it. But there is no doubt
that the righteous alone possess the baptism of Christ, since they alone possess both the favor
and the truth of Christ. This is certainly false, as they confess themselves. For those envious
ones also who are of the party of the devil, though placed within the Church, as Cyprian
tells us, and who were well known to the Apostle Paul, had baptism, but did not belong to
the members of that dove which is safely sheltered on the rock.</p>

<p>81. Adelphius of Thasbalte1743 said: "It is surely without cause that they
find fault with the truth in false and invidious terms, saying that we rebaptize, since the
Church does not rebaptize heretics, but baptizes them."1744</p>
<p>82. Truly enough it does not rebaptize them, because it only baptizes those who were
not baptized before; and this earlier custom has only been confirmed in a later Council by
a more careful perfecting of the truth.</p>

<p>83. Demetrius of the Lesser Leptis1745 said: "We uphold one baptism,
because we claim for the Catholic Church alone what is her own. But those who say that
heretics baptize truly and lawfully are themselves the men who make, not two, but many
baptisms; for since heresies are many in number, the baptisms, too, will be reckoned according
to their number."1746</p>
<p>84. To him we answer: If this were so, then would as many baptisms be reckoned as
there are works of the flesh, of which the apostle says "that they which do such things shall
not inherit the kingdom of God;"1747 among which are reckoned also heresies; and so many
of those very works are tolerated within the Church as though in the chaff, and yet there is
one baptism for them all, which is not vitiated by any work of unrighteousness.</p>

<p>85. Vincentius of Thibari1748 said: "We know that heretics are worse
than heathens. If they, being converted, wish to come to God, they have assuredly a rule of
truth, which the Lord by His divine precept committed to the apostles, saying, ‘Go ye, lay
on hands in my name, cast out devils;’1749 and in another place, ‘Go ye, and teach all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.’1750
Therefore, first by the laying on of hands in exorcism, secondly by regeneration in baptism,
they may come to the promises of Christ; but my judgment is that in no other way should
this be done."1751</p>
<p>86. By what rule he asserts that heretics are worse than heathens I do not know, seeing
that the Lord says, "If he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man
and a publican."1752 Is a heretic worse even than such? I do not gainsay it. I do not, however,
allow that because the man himself is worse than a heathen, that is, than a Gentile and pagan,
therefore whatever the sacrament contains that is Christ’s is mingled with his vices and
character, and perishes through the corruption of such admixture. For if even those who
depart from the Church, and become not the followers but the founders of heresies, have
been baptized before their secession, they continue to have baptism, although, according
to the above rule, they are worse than heathens; for if on correction they return, they do not
receive it, as they certainly would do if they had lost it. It is therefore possible that a man
may be worse than a heathen, and yet that the sacrament of Christ may not only be in him,
but be not a whit inferior to what it is in a holy and righteous man. For although to the extent
of his powers he has not preserved the sacrament, but done it violence in heart and will, yet
so far as the sacrament’s own nature is concerned, it has remained unhurt in its integrity
even in the man who despised and rejected it. Were not the people of Sodom heathens, that
is to say, Gentiles? The Jews therefore were worse, to whom the Lord says, "It shall be more
tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee;"1753 and to whom the
prophet says, "Thou hast justified Sodom,"1754 that is to say, in comparison with thee Sodom
is righteous. Shall we, however, maintain that on this account the holy sacraments which
existed among the Jews partook of the nature of the Jews themselves,—those sacraments
which the Lord Himself also accepted, and sent the lepers whom He had cleansed to fulfill

them,1755 of which when Zacharias was administering them, the angel stood by him, and
declared that his prayer had been heard while he was sacrificing in the temple?1756 These
same sacraments were both in the good men of that time, and in those bad men who were
worse than are the heathens, seeing that they were ranked before the Sodomites for
wickedness, and yet those sacraments were perfect and holy in both.</p>
<p>87. For even if the Gentiles themselves could have anything holy and right in their
doctrines, our saints did not condemn it, however much the Gentiles themselves were to
be detested for their superstitions and idolatry and pride, and the rest of their corruptions,
and to be punished with judgment from heaven unless they submitted to correction. For
when Paul the apostle also was saying something concerning God before the Athenians, he
adduced as a proof of what he said, that certain of them had said something to the same effect,
1757 which certainly would not be condemned but recognized in them if they should
come to Christ. And the holy Cyprian uses similar evidence against the same heathens; for,
speaking of the magi, he says, "The chief of them, however, Hostanes, asserts both that the
form of the true God cannot be seen, and also that true angels stand beside His seat. In
which Plato also agrees in like manner, and, maintaining the existence of one God, he calls
the others angels or demons. Hermes Trismegistus also speaks of one God, and confesses
that He is incomprehensible, and past our powers of estimation."1758 If, therefore, they
were to come to the perception of salvation in Christ, it surely would not be said to them,
This that ye have is bad, or false; but clearly it would deservedly be said, Though this in you
is perfect and true, yet it would profit nothing unless ye came to the grace of Christ. If,
therefore, anything that is holy can be found and rightly approved in the very heathens, although
the salvation which is of Christ is not yet to be granted to them, we ought not, even
though heretics are worse than they, to be moved to the desire of correcting what is bad in
them belonging to themselves, without being willing to acknowledge what is good in them
of Christ. But we will set forth from a fresh preface to consider the remaining judgments
of this Council.</p>

<p>1. Let us not be considered troublesome to our readers, if we discuss the
same question often and from different points of view. For although the Holy Catholic
Church throughout all nations be fortified by the authority of primitive custom and of a
plenary Council against those arguments which throw some darkness over the question
about baptism, whether it can be the same among heretics and schismatics that it is in the
Catholic Church, yet, since a different opinion has at one time been entertained in the unity
of the Church itself, by men who are in no wise to be despised, and especially by Cyprian,
whose authority men endeavor to use against us who are far removed from his charity, we
are therefore compelled to make use of the opportunity of examining and considering all
that we find on this subject in his Council and letters, in order, as it were, to handle at some
considerable length this same question, and to show how it has more truly been the decision
of the whole body of the Catholic Church, that heretics or schismatics, who have received
baptism already in the body from which they came, should be admitted with it into the
communion of the Catholic Church, being corrected in their error and rooted and grounded
in the faith, that, so far as concerns the sacrament of baptism, there should not be an addition
of something that was wanting, but a turning to profit of what was in them. And the holy
Cyprian indeed, now that the corruptible body no longer presseth down the soul, nor the
earthly tabernacle presseth down the mind that museth upon many things,1759 sees with
greater clearness that truth to which his charity made him deserving to attain. May he
therefore help us by his prayers, while we labor in the mortality of the flesh as in a darksome
cloud, that if the Lord so grant it, we may imitate so far as we can the good that was in him.
But if he thought otherwise than right on any point, and persuaded certain of his brethren
and colleagues to entertain his views in a matter which he now sees clearly through the
revelation of Him whom he loved, let us, who are far inferior to his merits, yet following,
as our weakness will allow, the authority of the Catholic Church of which he was himself a
conspicuous and most noble member, strive our utmost against heretics and schismatics,
seeing that they, being cut off from the unity which he maintained, and barren of the love
with which he was fruitful, and fallen away from the humility in which he stood, are disavowed
and condemned the more by him, in proportion as he knows that they wish to
search out his writings for purposes of treachery, and are unwilling to imitate what he did
for the maintainance of peace,—like those who, calling themselves Nazarene Christians,
and circumcising the foreskin of their flesh after the fashion of the Jews, being heretics by
birth in that error from which Peter, when straying from the truth, was called by Paul1760
persist in the same to the present day. As therefore they have remained in their perversity
cut off from the body of the Church, while Peter has been crowned in the primacy of the
<note type="footnote">1759 Wisd. ix. 15.</note>

<pb n="924"/>
apostles through the glory of martyrdom, so these men, while Cyprian, through the
abundance of his love, has been received into the portion of the saints through the brightness
of his passion, are obliged to recognize themselves as exiles from unity, and, in defence of
their calumnies, set up a citizen of unity as an opponent against the very home of unity.
Let us, therefore, go on to examine the other judgments of that Council after the same
fashion.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="925"/>
<head>Chapter 2.</head>
<p>2. Marcus of Mactaris1761 said: "It is not to be wondered at if heretics, being
enemies and opponents of the truth, claim to themselves what has been entrusted and
vouchsafed to other men. What is marvellous is that some of us, traitors to the truth, uphold
heretics and oppose Christians; therefore we decree that heretics should be baptized."1762</p>
<p>3. To him we answer: It is indeed much more to be wondered at, and deserving of expressions
of great praise, that Cyprian and his colleagues had such love for unity that they
continued in unity with those whom they considered to be traitors to the truth, without any
apprehension of being polluted by them. For when Marcus said, "It is marvellous that some
of us, traitors to the truth, uphold heretics and oppose Christians," it seemed natural that
he should add, Therefore we decree that communion should not be held with them. This
he did not say; but what he does say is, "Therefore we decree that heretics should be baptized,"
adhering to what the peaceful Cyprian had enjoined in the first instance, saying, "Judging
no man, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain a different opinion."
While, therefore, the Donatists calumniate us and call us traditors, I should be glad to know,
supposing that any Jew or pagan were found, who, after reading the records of that Council
should call both us and them, according to their own rules, traitors to the truth, how we
should be able to make our joint defense so as to refute and wash away so grave a charge.
They give the name of traditors to men whom they were never able in times past to convict
of the offense, and whom they cannot now show to be involved in it, being themselves rather
shown to be liable to the same charge. But what has this to do with us? What shall we say
of them who, by their own showing, are unquestionably traitors? For if we, however falsely,
are called traditors, because, as they allege, we took part in the same communion with
traditors, we have all taken part with the traditors in question, seeing that in the time of the
blessed Cyprian the party of Donatus had not yet separated itself from unity. For the delivery
of the sacred books, from which they began to be called traditors, occurred somewhat more
than forty years after his martyrdom. If, therefore, we are traditors, because we sprang
from traditors, as they believe or pretend, we both of us derive our origin from those other
traitors. For there is no room for saying that they did not communicate with these traitors,
since they call them men of their own party. In the words of the Council which they are
most forward to quote, "Some of us," it declares, "traitors to the truth, uphold heretics." To
this is added the testimony of Cyprian, showing clearly that he remained in communion
with them, when he says, "Judging no man, nor removing any from the right of communion
if he entertain a different opinion." For those who entertained a different opinion were the
very persons whom Marcus calls traitors to the truth because they upheld heretics, as he
<note type="footnote">1761 Mactaris (Macthari) was in ecclesiastical province of Byzacium. This bishop is probably the Marcus of
Cypr. Ep. lxx.</note>
<note type="footnote">1762 Conc. Carth. sec. 38.</note>

<pb n="926"/>
maintains, by receiving them into the Church without baptism. That it was, moreover, the
custom that they should be so received, is testified both by Cyprian himself in many passages,
and by some bishops in this Council. Whence it is evident that, if heretics have not baptism,
the Church of Christ of those days was full of traitors, who upheld them by receiving them
in this way. I would urge, therefore, that we plead our cause in common against the charge
of treason which they cannot disavow, and therein our special case will be argued against
the charge of delivering the books, which they could not prove against us. But let us argue
the point as though they had convicted us; and what we shall answer jointly to those who
urge against both of us the general treason of our forefathers, that we will answer to these
men who urge against us that our forefathers gave up the sacred books. For as we were dead
because our forefathers delivered up the books, which caused them to divide themselves
from us, so both we and they themselves are dead through the treason of our forefathers,
from whom both we and they are sprung. But since they say they live, they hold that that
treason does not in any way affect them, therefore neither are we affected by the delivery of
the books. And it should be observed that, according to them, the treason is indisputable:
while, according to us, there is no truth either in the former charge of treason, because we
say that heretics also may have the baptism of Christ; nor in the latter charge of delivering
the books, because in that they were themselves beaten. They have therefore no reason for
separating themselves by the wicked sin of schism, because, if our forefathers were not guilty
of delivering up the books, as we say, there is no charge which can affect us at all; but if they
were guilty of the sin, as these men say, then it is just as far from affecting us as the sin of
those other traitors is from affecting either us or them. And hence, since there is no charge
that can implicate us from the unrighteousness of our forefathers, the charge arising against
them from their own schism is manifestly proved.</p>

<p>4. Satius of Sicilibba1763 said: "If heretics receive forgiveness of their sins
in their own baptism, it is without reason that they come to the Church. For since it is for
sins that men are punished in the day of judgment, heretics have nothing to fear in the
judgment of Christ if they have obtained remission of their sins."1764</p>
<p>5. This too might also have been our own judgment; but let its author beware in what
spirit it was said. For it is expressed in terms of such import, that I should feel no compunction
in consenting and subscribing to it in the same spirit in which I too believe that heretics
may indeed have the baptism of Christ, but cannot have the remission of their sins. But he
does not say, If heretics baptize or are baptized, but "If heretics," he says, "receive forgiveness
of their sins in their own baptism, it is without reason that they come to the Church." For
if we were to set in the place of heretics those whom Cyprian knew within the Church as
"renouncing the world in words alone and not in deeds," we also might express this same
judgment, in just so many words, with the most perfect truth. If those who only seem to be
converted receive forgiveness of their sins in their own baptism, it is without reason that
they are afterwards led on to a true conversion. For since it is for sins that men are punished
in the day of judgment, "those who renounce the world in words and not in deeds" have
nothing to fear in the judgment of Christ if they have obtained remission of their sins. But
this reasoning is only made perfect by some such context as is formed by the addition of
the words. But they ought to fear the judgment of Christ, and to lose no time in being
converted in the truth of their hearts; and, when they have done this, it is certainly not necessary
that they should be baptized a second time. It was possible, therefore, for them to
receive baptism, and either not to receive remission of their sins, or to be burdened again
at once with the load of sins which were forgiven them; and so the same is the case also with
the heretics.</p>

<p>6. Victor of Gor1765 said: "Seeing that sins are forgiven only in the baptism
of the Church, he who admits heretics to communion without baptism is guilty of two errors
contrary to reason; for, on the one hand, he does not cleanse the heretics, and, on the other,
he defiles the Christians."1766</p>
<p>7. To this we answer that the baptism of the Church exists even among heretics, though
they themselves are not within the Church; just as the water of Paradise was found in the
land of Egypt, though that land was not itself in Paradise. We do not therefore admit heretics
to communion without baptism; and since they come with their waywardness corrected,
we receive not their sins, but the sacraments of Christ. And, in respect of the remission of
their sins, we say again here exactly what we said above. And certainly, in regard of what
he says at the end of his judgment, declaring that he "is guilty of two errors contrary to
reason, seeing that on the one hand he does not cleanse the heretics, and on the other he
defiles the Christians," Cyprian himself is the first and the most earnest in repudiating this
with the colleagues who agreed with him. For neither did he think that he was defiled, when,
on account of the bond of peace, he decreed that it was right to hold communion with such
men, when he used the words, "Judging no one, nor removing any from the right of communion
if he entertain a different opinion." Or, if heretics defile the Church by being admitted
to communion without being baptized, then the whole Church has been defiled in
virtue of that custom which has been so often recorded here. And just as those men call us
traditors because of our forefathers, in whom they were able to prove nothing of the sort
when they laid the charge against them, so, if every man partakes of the character of those
with whom he may have held communion, all were then made heretics. And if every one
who asserts this is mad, it must be false that Victor says, when he declares that "he who admits
heretics to communion without baptism, not only fails to cleanse the heretics, but pollutes
the Christians as well." Or if this be true, they were then not admitted without baptism, but
those men had the baptism of Christ, although it was given and received among heretics,
who were so admitted in accordance with that custom which these very men acknowledged
to exist; and on the same grounds they are even now rightly admitted in the same manner.</p>

<p>8. Aurelius of Utica1767 said: "Since the apostle says that we ought not to
be partakers with the sins of other men,1768 what else does he do but make himself partaker
with the sins of other men, who holds communion with heretics without the baptism of the
Church? And therefore I pronounce my judgment that heretics should be baptized, that
they may receive remission of their sins, and so communion be allowed to them."1769</p>
<p>9. The answer is: Therefore Cyprian and all those bishops were partakers in the sins
of other men, inasmuch as they remained in communion with such men, when they removed
no one from the right of communion who entertained a different opinion. Where, then, is
the Church? Then, to say nothing for the moment of heretics,—since the words of this
judgment are applicable also to other sinners, such as Cyprian saw with lamentation to be
in the Church with him, whom, while he confuted them, he yet tolerated,—where is the
Church, which, according to these words must be held to have perished from that very
moment by the contagion of their sins? But if, as is the most firmly established truth, the
Church both has remained and does remain, the partaking of the sins of others, which is
forbidden by the apostle, must be considered only to consist in consenting to them. But let
heretics be baptized again, that they may receive remission of their sins, if the wayward and
the envious are baptized again, who, seeing that "they renounced the world in words and
not in deeds," were indeed able to receive baptism, but did not obtain remission of their
sins, as the Lord says, "If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive
your trespasses."1770</p>

<p>10. Iambus of Germaniciana1771 said: "Those who approve the baptism
of heretics disapprove ours, so as to deny that such as are, I will not say washed, but defiled
outside the Church, ought to be baptized within the Church."1772</p>
<p>11. To him we answer, that none of our party approves the baptism of heretics, but all
the baptism of Christ, even though it be found in heretics who are as it were chaff outside
the Church, as it may be found in other unrighteous men who are as chaff within the Church.
For if those who are baptized without the Church are not washed, but defiled, assuredly
those who are baptized outside the rock on which the Church is built are not washed, but
defiled. But all are without the said rock who hear the words of Christ and do them not.
Or if it be the case that they are washed indeed in baptism, but yet continue in the defilement
of their unrighteousness, from which they were unwilling to be changed for the better, the
same is true also of the heretics.</p>

can agree, then can there be something in common between us and heretics. Therefore I
give my judgment that heretics should be baptized."1775</p>
<p>13. To him the answer is: If light and darkness can agree, then can there be something
common between the righteous and unrighteous. Let him therefore declare his judgment

itself; or let him who can say if those are not unrighteous "who renounce the world in words

Further, if heresy be not the Church, how can the baptism of the Church exist among
heretics?"1778</p>
<p>15. To him we may answer as follows: Either Paradise is Paradise, or Egypt is Paradise.
Further, if Egypt be not Paradise, how can the water of Paradise be in Egypt? But it will be
said to us that it extends even thither by flowing forth from Paradise. In like manner,
therefore, baptism extends to heretics. Also we say: Either the rock is the Church, or the
sand is the Church. Further, since the sand is not the Church, how can baptism exist with
those who build upon the sand by hearing the words of Christ and doing them not?1779
And yet it does exist with them; and in like manner also it exists among the heretics.</p>

baptism,1783 but of the Catholic Church, to which alone is given authority to baptize."1784</p>
<p>19. What if another were to say as follows: One faith, one baptism, but of the righteous
only, to whom alone authority is given to baptize? As these words might be refuted, so also
may the judgment of Felix be refuted. Do even the unrighteous who are not1785 changed
in heart in baptism, while "they renounce the world in words and not in deeds" yet belong
to the members of the Church? Let them consider whether such a Church is the actual rock,
the very dove, the bride herself without spot or wrinkle.1786</p>

<p>20. Paul of Bobba1787 said: "I for my part am not moved if some fail to
uphold the faith and truth of the Church, seeing that the apostle says ‘For what if some did
not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid: yea let
God be true, but every man a liar.’1788 But if God be true, how can the truth of baptism be
in the company of heretics, where God is not?"1789</p>
<p>21. To him we answer: What is God among the covetous? And yet baptism exists
among them; and so also it exists among heretics. For they among whom God is, are the
temple of God. "But what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?"1790 Further, Paul
considers, and Cyprian agrees with him, that covetousness is idolatry; and Cyprian himself
again associates with his colleagues, who were robbers, but yet baptized, with great reward
of toleration.</p>

<p>23. The answer is: This power is not given to murderers either, that is, to those who
hate their brothers. For it was not said to such as these, "whosesoever sins ye remit, they
are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained."1793 And yet
they baptize, and both Paul tolerates them in the same communion of baptism, and Cyprian
acknowledges them.</p>

<p>24. Venantius of Tinisa1794 said: "If a husband, going on a journey into
foreign countries, had entrusted the guardianship of his wife to a friend, he would surely
keep her that was entrusted to his care with the utmost diligence, that her chastity and
holiness might not be defiled by any one. Christ our Lord and God, when going to the
Father, committed His bride to our care: do we keep her uncorrupt and undefiled, or do
we betray her purity and chastity to adulterers and corrupters? For he who makes the baptism
of Christ common with heretics betrays the bride of Christ to adulterers."1795</p>
<p>25. We answer: What of those who, when they are baptized, turn themselves to the
Lord with their lips and not with their heart? do not they possess an adulterous mind? Are
not they themselves lovers of the world, which they renounce in words and not in deeds;
and they corrupt good manners through evil communications, saying, "Let us eat and drink;
for to-morrow we die?"1796 Did not the discourse of the apostle take heed even against such
as these, when he says, "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through
his subtilty, so your minds [also] should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
Christ?"1797 When, therefore, Cyprian held the baptism of Christ to be in common with
such men, did he therefore betray the bride of Christ into the hands of adulterers, or did he
not rather recognize the necklace of the Bridegroom even on an adulteress?</p>

baptize, the same makes two baptisms."1800</p>
<p>27. To him we answer: Why does not he also make two baptisms who maintains that
the unrighteous also can baptize? For although the righteous and unrighteous are in
themselves opposed to one another, yet the baptism which the righteous give, such as was
Paul, or such as was also Cyprian, is not contrary to the baptism which those unrighteous
men were wont to give who hated Paul, whom Cyprian understands to have been not heretics,
but bad Catholics; and although the moderation which was found in Cyprian, and the covetousness
which was found in his colleagues, are in themselves opposed to one another, yet
the baptism which Cyprian used to give was not contrary to the baptism which his colleagues
who opposed him used to give, but one and the same with it, because in both cases it is He
that baptizes of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizeth."1801</p>

<p>28. Saturninus of Victoriana1802 said: "If heretics may baptize, they are
excused and defended in doing unlawful things; nor do I see why either Christ called them
His adversaries, or the apostle called them antichrists."1803</p>
<p>29. To him we answer: We say that heretics have no authority to baptize in the same
sense in which we say that defrauders have no authority to baptize. For not only to the
heretic, but to the sinner, God says, "What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that
thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?" To the same person He assuredly says,
"When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him."1804 How much worse, therefore,
are those who did not consent with thieves, but themselves were wont to plunder farms with
treacherous deceits? Yet Cyprian did not consent with them, though he did tolerate them
in the corn-field of the Catholic Church, lest the wheat should be rooted out together with
it. And yet at the same time the baptism which they themselves conferred was the very
selfsame baptism, because it was not of them, but of Christ. As therefore they, although the
baptism of Christ be recognized in them, were yet not excused and defended in doing unlawful
things, and Christ rightly called those His adversaries who were destined, by persevering
in such things, to hear the doom, "Depart from me, ye that work iniquity,"1805 whence
also they are called antichrists, because they are contrary to Christ while they live in opposition
to His words, so likewise is it the case with heretics.</p>

<p>30. Another Saturninus of Tucca1806 said: "The Gentiles, although they
worship idols, yet acknowledge and confess the supreme God, the Father and Creator.
Against Him Marcion blasphemes, and some men do not blush to approve the baptism of
Marcion.1807 How do such priests either maintain or vindicate the priesthood of God, who
do not baptize the enemies of God, and hold communion with them while they are thus
unbaptized?"1808</p>
<p>31. The answer is this: Truly when such terms as this are used, all moderation is passed;
nor do they take into consideration that even they themselves hold communion with such
men, "judging no one, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain a
contrary opinion." But Saturninus has used an argument in this very judgment of his, which
might furnish materials for his admonition (if he would pay attention to it), that in each
man what is wrong should be corrected, and what is right should be approved, since he says,
"The Gentiles, although they worship idols, yet acknowledge and confess the supreme God,
the Father and Creator." If, then, any Gentile of such a kind should come to God, would
he wish to correct and change this point in him, that he acknowledged and confessed God
the Father and Creator? I trow not. But he would amend in him his idolatry, which was
an evil in him; and he would give to him the sacraments of Christ, which he did not possess;
and anything that was wayward which he found in him he would correct; and anything
which had been wanting he would supply. So also in the Marcionist heretic he would acknowledge
the perfectness of baptism, he would correct his waywardness, he would teach
him Catholic truth.</p>

with a sinner? But what else did all of them do, "in judging no one, or removing from the
right of communion any one who entertained a different opinion"? Where, then, is the
Church? Are those things not an obstacle to those who are patient, and tolerate the tares
lest the wheat should be rooted out together with them? I would have them therefore say,
who have committed the sacrilege of schism by separating themselves from the whole world,
how it comes that they have in their mouths the judgment of Cyprian, while they do not
have in their hearts the patience of Cyprian. But to this Marcellus we have an answer in
what has been said above concerning baptism and the remission of sins, explaining how
there can be baptism in a man although there be in him no remission of his sins.</p>

<p>37. To him we answer: If you say that the grace of baptism is identical with baptism,
then it exists among heretics; but if baptism is the sacrament or outward sign of grace, while
the grace itself is the abolition of sins, then the grace of baptism does not exist with heretics.
But so there is one baptism and one Church, just as there is one faith. As therefore the good
and bad, not having one hope, can yet have one baptism, so those who have not one common
Church can have one common baptism.</p>

<p>39. The answer is: This may also be considered as the expression of our judgment too,
and this is just what has been done in respect of this question of baptism. For after that the
truth had been more clearly revealed, error gave way to truth, when that most wholesome
custom was further confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council. It is well, however,
that they so constantly bear in mind that it was possible even for Peter, the chief of the
apostles, to have been at one time minded otherwise than the truth required; which we believe,
without any disrespect to Cyprian, to have been the case with him, and that with all our love
for Cyprian, for it is not right that he should be loved with greater love than Peter.</p>

had not received remission of his sins, because he entertained hatred towards his brother
in his heart, was nevertheless not to be baptized again when he dismissed that hatred from
his heart, does such a man interfere with the baptism of the Church on behalf of murderers,

also in the case of heretics.</p>

<p>48. Therapius of Bulla1827 said: "If a man gives up and betrays the baptism
of Christ to heretics, what else can he be said to be but a Judas to the Bride of Christ?"1828</p>
<p>49. How great a condemnation have we here of all schismatics, who have separated
themselves by wicked sacrilege from the inheritance of Christ dispersed throughout the
whole world, if Cyprian held communion with such as was the traitor Judas, and yet was
not defiled by them; or if he was defiled, then were all made such as Judas; or if they were
not, then the evil deeds of those who went before do not belong to those who came after
even though they were the offspring of the same communion. Why, therefore, do they cast
in our teeth the traditores, against whom they did not prove their charge, and do not cast
in their own teeth Judas, with whom Cyprian and his colleagues held communion? Behold
the Council in which these men are wont to boast! We indeed say, that he who approves
the baptism of Christ even in heretics, does not betray to heretics the baptism of Christ; just
in the same way as he does not betray to murderers the baptism of Christ who approves the
baptism of Christ even in murderers: but inasmuch as they profess to prescribe to us from
the decrees of this Council what opinions we ought to hold, let them first assent to it themselves.
See how therein were compared to the traitor Judas, all who said that heretics, although
baptized in heresy, should not be baptized again. Yet with such Cyprian was willing
to hold communion, when he said, "Judging no man, nor depriving any of the right of
communion if he entertain a contrary opinion." But that there had been men of such a sort
in former times within the Church, is made clear by the sentence in which he says: "But
some one will say, What, then, shall be done with these men who in times past were admitted
into the Church without baptism?"1829 That such had been the custom of the Church, is
testified again and again by the very men who compose this Council. If, therefore, any one
who does this "can be said to be nothing else but a Judas to the Bride of Christ," according
to the terms in which the judgment of Therapius is couched; but Judas, according to the
teaching of the gospel, was a traitor; then all those men held communion with traitors who
at that time uttered those very judgments, and before they uttered them they all had become
traitors through that custom which at that time was retained by the Church. All, therefore—
that is to say, both we and they themselves who were the offspring of that unity—are
traitors. But we defend ourselves in two ways: first, because without prejudice to the right
of unity, as Cyprian himself declared in his opening speech, we do not assent to the decrees
of this Council in which this judgment was pronounced; and secondly, because we hold
that the wicked in no way hurt the good in Catholic unity, until at the last the chaff be sep-

infection from communion with the wicked, have no resource to save them from allowing
both that the earlier Christians, whose offspring they are, were traitors, inasmuch as they

use it wrong.</p>

righteously that they should be baptized."1852</p>

the Catholic Church, it is clear that a man cannot be baptized outside the Church; and
therefore I give my judgment, that those who have been bathed in heresy or in schism ought
to be baptized on coming to the Church."1854</p>
<p>71. There is one baptism in the Catholic Church, in such a sense that, when any have
gone out from it, it does not become two in those who go out, but remains one and the
same. What, therefore, is recognized in those who return, should also be recognized in
those who received it from men who have separated themselves, since they did not lose it
when they went apart into heresy.</p>

one baptism. And therefore I say, both that if anything has been set on foot or done among
the heretics, that it ought to be rescinded; and also, that they who come out from among
the heretics should be baptized in the Church."1856</p>
<p>73. Let it therefore be pronounced of no effect that they baptize, who hear the words
of God and do them not, when they shall begin to pass from unrighteousness to righteousness,
that is, from the sand to the rock. And if this is not done, because what there was in them
of Christ was not violated by their unrighteousness, then let this also be understood in the
case of heretics: for neither is there the same hope in the unrighteous, so long as they are
on the sand, as there is in those who are upon the rock; and yet there is in both the same
baptism, although as it is said that there is one hope, so also is it said that there is one baptism.</p>

the precepts of the holy Scriptures, those who have been unlawfully baptized outside the
Church by heretics, if they wish to flee to the Church, should obtain the grace of baptism
where it is lawfully given."1858</p>
<p>75. Our answer is: Let them indeed begin to have in a lawful manner to salvation what
they before had unlawfully to destruction; because each man is justified under the same
baptism, when he has turned himself to God with a true heart, as that under which he was
condemned, when on receiving it he "renounced the world in words alone, and not in deeds."</p>

<p>77. This indeed is true, that "baptism is not unto salvation except within the Catholic
Church." For in itself it can indeed exist outside the Catholic Church as well; but there it is
not unto salvation, because there it does not work salvation; just as that sweet savor of Christ
is certainly not unto salvation in them that perish,1861 though from a fault not in itself, but
in them. But "whatsoever is without the Catholic Church is mere pretense," yet only in so
far as it is not Catholic. But there may be something Catholic outside the Catholic Church,
just as the name of Christ could exist outside the congregation of Christ, in which name he
who did not follow with the disciples was casting out devils.1862 For there may be pretense
also within the Catholic Church, as is unquestionable in the case of those "who renounce
the world in words and not in deeds," and yet the pretense is not Catholic. As, therefore,
there is in the Catholic Church something which is not Catholic, so there may be something
which is Catholic outside the Catholic Church.</p>

themselves, because they separated themselves from the Church, and certainly they previously
had what they received there. But if it is absurd to say that those are not heretics through
whom the rest became heretics, it is therefore possible that a heretic should have what turns
to his destruction through his evil use of it.</p>

<p>81. This man, too, is a witness to the custom, in which he gives us the greatest assistance,
whatever else he may appear to say against us. But this is not the reason why heretics come
over to us, because they have received nothing outside, but that what they did receive may
begin to be of use to them: for this it could not be outside in any wise.</p>

with the same power, and baptizing those who believe the faith. And therefore heretics,
who, being without, have neither power nor the Church of Christ, cannot baptize any one
with His baptism."1870</p>
<p>85. Are, then, ill-affectioned murderers successors of the apostles? Why, then, do they
baptize? Is it because they are not outside? But they are outside the rock, to which the Lord
gave the keys, and on which He said that He would build His Church.1871</p>

by our too great forwardness, that not having been baptized in the Church of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and having therefore not received remission of their sins, they may not impute to
us, when the day of judgment comes, that we have been the cause of their not being baptized,
and not having obtained the indulgence of the grace of God. On which account, since there
is one Church and one baptism, when they are converted to us, let them receive together
with the Church the baptism also of the Church."1873</p>
<p>87. Nay, when they are transferred to the rock, and joined to the society of the Dove,
let them receive the remission of their sins, which they could not have outside the rock and
outside the Dove, whether they were openly without, like the heretics, or apparently within,
like the abandoned Catholics; of whom, however, it is clear that they both have and confer
baptism without remission of sins, when even from themselves it is received by men, who,
being not changed for the better, honor God with their lips, while their heart is far from
Him.1874 Yet it is true that there is one baptism, just as there is one Dove, though those
who are not in the one communion of the Dove may yet have baptism in common.</p>

<p>88. Also another Aurelius of Chullabi1875 said: "The Apostle John has
laid down in his epistle the following precept: ‘If there come any unto you, and bring not
this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for he that biddeth
him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.’1876 How can such men be admitted
without consideration into the house of God, who are forbidden to be admitted into our
private house? Or how can we hold communion with them without the baptism of Christ,
when, if we only so much as bid them God speed, we are partakers of their evil deeds?"1877</p>
<p>89. In respect of this testimony of John there is no need of further disputation, since it
has no reference at all to the question of baptism, which we are at present discussing. For
he says, "If any come unto you, and bring not the doctrine of Christ." But heretics leaving
the doctrine of their error are converted to the doctrine of Christ, that they may be incorporated
with the Church, and may begin to belong to the members of that Dove whose
sacrament they previously had; and therefore what previously they lacked belonging to it
is given to them, that is to say, peace and charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience,
and of faith unfeigned.1878 But what they previously had belonging to the Dove is acknowledged,
and received without any depreciation; just as in the adulteress God recognises His
gifts, even when she is following her lovers; because when after her fornication is corrected
she is turned again to chastity, those gifts are not laid to her charge, but she herself is corrected.
1879 But just as Cyprian might have defended himself if this testimony of John had been
cast in his teeth whilst he was holding communion with men like these, so let those against
whom it is spoken make their own defense. For to the question before us, as I said before,
it has no reference at all. For John says that we are not to bid God speed to men of strange
doctrine; but Paul the apostle says, with even greater vehemence, "If any man that is called
a brother be covetous, or a drunkard," or anything of the sort, with such an one no not to
eat;1880 and yet Cyprian used to admit to fellowship, not with his private table, but with the
altar of God, his colleagues who were usurers, and treacherous, and fraudulent, and robbers.
But in what manner this may be defended has been sufficiently set forth in other books
already.</p>

fall into the ditch.’1883 Since, therefore, it is clear that heretics can give no light1884 to any
one, as being blind themselves, therefore their baptism is invalid."1885</p>
<p>91. Neither do we say that it is valid for salvation so long as they are heretics, just as it
is of no value to those murderers of whom we spoke, so long as they hate their brethren:
for they also themselves are in darkness, and if any one follows them they fall together into
the ditch; and yet it does not follow that they either have not baptism or are unable to confer
it.</p>

represent their views, being absent indeed in body, but present in spirit, who deliver this
same judgment as our colleagues, that heretics cannot have communion with us, unless they
have been baptized with the baptism of the Church."1889</p>
<p>93. He means, I suppose, that communion which belongs to the society of the Dove;
for in the partaking of the sacraments they doubtless held communion with them, judging
no man, nor removing any from the right of communion if he held a different opinion. But
with whatever reference he spoke, there is no great need for these words being refuted. For
certainly a heretic would not be admitted to communion, unless he had been baptized with
the baptism of the Church. But it is clear that the baptism of the Church exists even among
heretics if it be consecrated with the words of the gospel; just as the gospel itself belongs to
the Church, and has nothing to do with their waywardness, but certainly retains its own
holiness.</p>

<p>96. Cyprian of Carthage said: "My opinion has been set forth with the
greatest fullness in the letter which has been written to our colleague Jubaianus,1892 that
heretics being called enemies of Christ and antichrists according to the testimony of the
gospel and the apostles, should, when they come to the Church, be baptized with the one
baptism of the Church, that from enemies they may be made friends, and that from antichrists
they may be made Christians."1893</p>
<p>97. What need is there of further disputation here, seeing that we have already handled
with the utmost care that very epistle to Jubaianus of which he has made mention? And as
to what he has said here, let us not forget that it might be said of all unrighteous men who,
as he himself bears witness, are in the Catholic Church, and whose power of possessing and
of conferring baptism is not questioned by any of us. For they come to the Church, who
pass to Christ from the party of the devil, and build upon the rock, and are incorporated
with the Dove, and are placed in security in the garden enclosed and fountain sealed; where
none of those are found who live contrary to the precepts of Christ, wherever they may seem
to be. For in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, while discussing this very question, he
himself warned us at sufficient length, and in no ambiguous terms, of what kind of society
we should understand that the Church consists. For he says, in speaking of a certain man,
"Let him become an alien and profane, an enemy to the peace and unity of the Lord, not
dwelling in the house of God, that is to say, in the Church of Christ, in which none dwell
save those who are of one heart and of one mind."1894 Let those, therefore, who would lay
injunctions on us on the authority of Cyprian, pay attention for a time to what we here say.
For if only those who are of one heart and of one mind dwell in the Church of Christ, beyond
all question those were not dwelling in the Church of Christ, however much they might
appear to be within, who of envy and contention were announcing Christ without charity;
by whom he understands, not the heretics and schismatics who are mentioned by the Apostle
Paul,1895 but false brethren holding conversation with him within, who certainly ought not
to have baptized, because they were not dwelling in the Church, in which he himself says
that none dwell save those who are of one heart and of one mind: unless, indeed, any one
be so far removed from the truth as to say that those were of one heart and of one mind
who were envious and malevolent, and contentious without charity; and yet they used to
baptize: nor did the detestable waywardness which they displayed in any degree violate or
diminish from the sacrament of Christ, which was handled and dispensed by them.</p>

<p>98. It is indeed worth while to consider the whole of the passage in the
aforesaid letter to Magnus, which he has put together as follows: "Not dwelling," he says,
"in the house of God—that is to say, in the Church of Christ—in which none dwell save
those that are of one heart and of one mind, as the Holy Spirit says in the Psalms, speaking
of ‘God that maketh men to be of one mind in an house.’ 1896 Finally, the very sacrifices of
the Lord declare that Christians are united among themselves by a firm and inseparable
love for one another. For when the Lord calls bread, which is compacted together by the
union of many grains, His body,1897 He is signifying one people, whom He bore, compacted
into one body; and when He calls wine, which is pressed out from a multitude of branches
and clusters and brought together into one, His blood,1898 He also signifies one flock joined
together by the mingling of a multitude united into one." These words of the blessed Cyprian
show that he both understood and loved the glory of the house of God, which house
he asserted to consist of those who are of one heart and of one mind, proving it by the
testimony of the prophets and the meaning of the sacraments, and in which house certainly
were not found those envious persons, those malevolent without charity, who nevertheless
used to baptize. From whence it is clear that the sacrament of Christ can both be in and be
administered by those who are not in the Church of Christ, in which Cyprian himself bears
witness that there are none dwelling save those who are of one heart and of one mind. Nor
can it indeed be said that they are allowed to baptize so long as they are undetected, seeing
that the Apostle Paul did not fail to detect those of whose ministry he bears unquestionable
testimony in his epistle, saying that he rejoices that they also were proclaiming Christ. For
he says of them, "Whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice,
yea, and will rejoice."1899</p>

<p>99. Taking all these things, therefore, into consideration, I think that I
am not rash in saying that there are some in the house of God after such a fashion as not to
be themselves the very house of God, which is said to be built upon a rock,1900 which is
called the one dove,1901 which is styled the beauteous bride without spot or wrinkle,1902
and a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed, a well of living water, an orchard of pomegranates
with pleasant fruits;1903 which house also received the keys, and the power of binding and
loosing.1904 If any one shall neglect this house when it arrests and corrects him, the Lord
says, "Let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican."1905 Of this house it is said,
"Lord, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, and the place where Thine honor dwelleth;"
1906 and, "He maketh men to be of one mind in an house;"1907 and, "I was glad when
they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord;"1908 and, "Blessed are they that dwell
in Thy house, O Lord; they will be still praising Thee;"1909 with countless other passages to
the same effect. This house is also called wheat, bringing forth fruit with patience, some
thirty-fold, some sixtyfold, and some an hundredfold.1910 This house is also in vessels of
gold and of silver,1911 and in precious stones and imperishable woods. To this house it is
said, "Forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace;"1912 and, "For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."1913 For this house
is composed of those that are good and faithful, and of the holy servants of God dispersed
throughout the world, and bound together by the unity of the Spirit, whether they know
each other personally or not. But we hold that others are said to be in the house after such
a sort, that they belong not to the substance of the house, nor to the society of fruitful and
peaceful justice, but only as the chaff is said to be among the corn; for that they are in the
house we cannot deny, when the apostle says, "But in a great house there are not only vessels

of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor."
1914 Of this countless multitude are found to be not only the crowd which within the
Church afflicts the hearts of the saints, who are so few in comparison with so vast a host,
but also the heresies and schisms which exist in those who have burst the meshes of the net,
and may now be said to be rather out of the house than in the house, of whom it is said,
"They went out from us, but they were not of us."1915 For they are more thoroughly separated,
now that they are also divided from us in the body, than are those who live within the
Church in a carnal and worldly fashion, and are separated from us in the spirit.</p>
<note type="footnote">1914 2 Tim. ii. 20. In Retract. ii. 18, Augustin says that he thinks the meaning of this last passage to be, not
as Cyprian took it, Ep. liv. 3, that the vessels of gold and silver are the good, which are to honor; the vessels of
wood and earth the wicked, which are to dishonor: but that the material of the vessels refers to the outward
appearance of the several members of the Church, and that in each class some will be found to honor, and some
to dishonor. This interpretation he derives from Tychonius.</note>
<note type="footnote">1915 1 John ii. 19.</note>
</div>

<p>100. Of all these several classes, then, no one doubts respecting those
first, who are in the house of God in such a sense as themselves to be the house of God,
whether they be already spiritual, or as yet only babes nurtured with milk, but still making
progress with earnestness of heart, towards that which is spiritual, that such men both have
baptism so as to be of profit to themselves, and transmit it to those who follow their example
so as to benefit them; but that in its transmission to those who are false, whom the Holy
Spirit shuns, though they themselves, so far as lies with them, confer it so as to be of profit,
yet the others receive it in vain, since they do not imitate those from whom they receive it.
But they who are in the great house after the fashion of vessels to dishonor, both have baptism
without profit to themselves, and transmit it without profit to those who follow their example:
those, however, receive it with profit, who are united in heart and character, not to
their ministers, but to the holy house of God. But those who are more thoroughly separated,
so as to be rather out of the house than in the house, have baptism without any profit to
themselves; and, moreover, there is no profit to those who receive it from them, unless they
be compelled by urgent necessity to receive it, and their heart in receiving it does not depart
from the bond of unity: yet nevertheless they possess it, though the possession be of no
avail; and it is received from them, even when it is of no profit to those who so receive it,
though, in order that it may become of use, they must depart from their heresy or schism,
and cleave to that house of God. And this ought to be done, not only by heretics and
schismatics, but also by those who are in the house through communion in the sacraments,
yet so as to be outside the house through the perversity of their character. For so the sacrament
begins to be of profit even to themselves, which previously was of no avail.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="53">
<pb n="979"/>
<head>Chapter 53.</head>
<p>101. The question is also commonly raised, whether baptism is to be held
valid which is received from one who had not himself received it, if, from some promptings
of curiosity, he had chanced to learn how it ought to be conferred; and whether it makes no
difference in what spirit the recipient receives it, whether in mockery or in sincerity: if in
mockery, whether the difference arises when the mockery is of deceit, as in the Church, or
in what is thought to be the Church; or when it is in jest, as in a play: and which is the more
accursed, to receive it deceitfully in the Church, or in heresy or schism without deceit, that
is to say, with full sincerity of heart: or whether it be worse to receive it deceitfully in heresy
or in good faith in a play, if any one were to be moved by a sudden feeling of religion in the
midst of his acting. And yet, if we compare such an one even with him who receives it deceitfully
in the Catholic Church itself, I should be surprised if any one were to doubt which
of the two should be preferred; for I do not see of what avail the intention of him who gives
in truth can be to him who receives deceitfully. But let us consider, in the case of some one
also giving it in deceit, when both the given and the recipient are acting deceitfully in the
unity of the Catholic Church itself, whether this should rather be acknowledged as baptism,
or that which is given in a play, if any one should be found who received it faithfully from
a sudden impulse of religion: or whether it be not true that, so far as the men themselves
are concerned, there is a very great difference between the believing recipient in a play, and
the mocking recipient in the Church; but that in regard to the genuineness of the sacrament
there is no difference. For if it makes no difference in respect to the genuineness of the
sacrament within the Catholic Church itself, whether certain persons celebrate it in truth
or in deceit, so long as both still celebrate the same thing, I cannot see why it should make
a difference outside, seeing that he who receives it is not cloaked by his deceit, but he is
changed by his religious impulse. Or have those truthful persons among whom it is celebrated
more power for the confirmation of the sacrament, than those deceitful men by whom and
in whom it is celebrated can exert for its invalidation? And yet, if the deceit be subsequently
brought to light, no one seeks a repetition of the sacrament; but the fraud is either punished
by excommunication or set right by penitence.</p>
<p>102. But the safe course for us is, not to advance with any rashness of judgment in setting
forth a view which has neither been started in any regionary Council of the Catholic Church
nor established in a plenary one; but to assert, with all the confidence of a voice that cannot
be gainsaid, what has been confirmed by the consent of the universal Church, under the
direction of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, if any one were to press
me—supposing I were duly seated in a Council in which a question were raised on points
like these—to declare what my own opinion was, without reference to the previously expressed
views of others, whose judgment I would rather follow, if I were under the influence
of the same feelings as led me to assert what I have said before, I should have no hesitation
in saying that all men possess baptism who have received it in any place, from any sort of

<pb n="980"/>
men, provided that it were consecrated in the words of the gospel, and received without
deceit on their part with some degree of faith; although it would be of no profit to them for
the salvation of their souls if they were without charity, by which they might be grafted into
the Catholic Church. For "though I have faith," says the apostle, "so that I could remove
mountains, but have not charity, I am nothing."1916 Just as already, from the established
decrees of our predecessors, I have no hesitation in saying that all those have baptism who,
though they receive it deceitfully, yet receive it in the Church, or where the Church is thought
to be by those in whose society it is received, of whom it was said, "They went out from
us."1917 But when there was no society of those who so believed, and when the man who
received it did not himself hold such belief, but the whole thing was done as a farce, or a
comedy, or a jest,—if I were asked whether the baptism which was thus conferred should
be approved, I should declare my opinion that we ought to pray for the declaration of God’s
judgment through the medium of some revelation seeking it with united prayer and earnest
groanings of suppliant devotion, humbly deferring all the time to the decision of those who
were to give their judgment after me, in case they should set forth anything as already known
and determined. And, therefore, how much the more must I be considered to have given
my opinion now without prejudice to the utterance of more diligent research or authority
higher than my own!</p>

<head>Chapter 54.</head>
<p>103. But now I think that it is fully time for me to bring to their due termination
these books also on the subject of baptism, in which our Lord God has shown to
us, through the words of the peaceful Bishop Cyprian and his brethren who agreed with
him, how great is the love which should be felt for catholic unity; so that even where they
were otherwise minded until God should reveal even this to them, 1918 they should rather
bear with those who thought differently from themselves, than sever themselves from them
by a wicked schism; whereby the mouths of the Donatists are wholly closed, even if we say
nothing of the followers of Maximian. For if the wicked pollute the good in unity, then even
Cyprian himself already found no Church to which he could be joined. But if the wicked
do not infect the good in unity, then the sacrilegious Donatist has no ground to set before
himself for separation. But if baptism is both possessed and transferred by the multitude
of others who work the works of the flesh, of which it is said, that "they which do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God,"1919 then it is possessed and transferred also by heretics,
who are numbered among those works; because they could have transferred it had they remained,
and did not lose it by their secession. But men of this kind confer it on their fellows
as fruitlessly and uselessly as the others who resemble them, inasmuch as they shall not inherit
the kingdom of God. And as, when those others are brought into the right path, it is
not that baptism begins to be present, having been absent before, but that it begins to profit
them, having been already in them; so is it the case with heretics as well. Whence Cyprian
and those who thought with him could not impose limits on the Catholic Church, which
they would not mutilate. But in that they were otherwise minded we feel no fear, seeing
that we too share in their veneration for Peter; yet in that they did not depart from unity
we rejoice, seeing that we, like them, are founded on the rock.</p>

<head>THE
Three Books of Augustin,
BISHOP OF HIPPO
IN ANSWER TO
The Letters of Petilian, the Donatist,
BISHOP OF CIRTA.</head>
<p>Written c. 400 A.D., some say 398 A.D., but Augustin places it some time after the
treatise on Baptism: Retractt. Bk. ii. xxv. From the same, we gather the following points as
to the origin of this treatise: Before A. had finished his books on the Trinity and his wordfor-
word commentary on Genesis, a reply to a letter which Petilian had addressed to his
followers, only a small part of which however had come into A.’s hands, demanded immediate
preparation. This constitutes Book First. Subsequently the whole document was obtained,
and he was engaged in preparing the second Book, c. 401; but even before the full
treatise of Petilian had been secured, the latter had obtained A.’s first book, and afterwards
put an epistle abusive of A. in circulation. The answer to this latter is Book Third, c. 402.
Petilian was originally an advocate. The opponents charged him with having become a
Donatist by compulsion, with assuming the title of Paraclete, and with endeavoring to prevent
all access on their part to his writings.</p>


<div type="textpart" subtype="book" n="1">

<head>Book I.</head>
<p>Written in the form of a letter addressed to the Catholics, in which the first portion of the letter
which Petilian had written to his adherents is examined and refuted.</p>
<p>Augustin, to the well-beloved brethren that belong to the care of our charge, greeting
in the Lord:</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<pb n="985"/>
<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>1. Ye know that we have often wished to bring forward into open notoriety,
and to confute, not so much from our own arguments as from theirs, the sacrilegious error
of the Donatist heretics; whence it came to pass that we wrote letters even to some of their
leaders,—not indeed for purposes of communion with them, for of that they had already
in times past rendered themselves unworthy by dissenting from the Church; nor yet in terms
of reproach, but of a conciliatory character, with the view that, having discussed the question
with us which caused them to break off from the holy communion of the whole world, they
might, on consideration of the truth, be willing to be corrected, and might not defend the
headstrong perversity of their predecessors with a yet more foolish obstinacy, but might be
reunited to the Catholic stock, so as to bring forth the fruits of charity. But as it is written,
"With those who have hated peace I am more peaceful,"1920 so they rejected my letters, just
as they hate the very name of peace, in whose interests they were written. Now, however,
as I was in the church of Constantina, Absentius1921 being present, with my colleague Fortunatus,
his bishop, the brethren brought before my notice a letter, which they said that a
bishop of the said schism had addressed to his presbyters, as was set forth in the superscription
of the letter itself. When I had read it, I was so amazed to find that in his very first
words he cut away the very roots of the whole claims of his party to communion, that I was
unwilling to believe that it could be the letter of a man who, if fame speaks truly, is especially
conspicuous among them for learning and eloquence. But some of those who were present
when I read it, being acquainted with the polish and embellishment of his composition,
gradually persuaded me that it was undoubtedly his address. I thought, however, that
whoever the author might be, it required refutation, lest the writer should seem to himself,
in the company of the inexperienced, to have written something of weight against the
Catholic Church.</p>
<p>2. The first point, then, that he lays down in his letter is the statement, "that we find
fault with them for the repetition of baptism, while we ourselves pollute our souls with a
laver stained with guilt." But to what profit is it that I should reproduce all his insulting
terms? For, since it is one thing to strengthen proofs, another thing to meddle with abusive
words by way of refutation, let us rather turn our attention to the mode in which he has
sought to prove that we do not possess baptism, and that therefore they do not require the
repetition of what was already present, but confer what hitherto was wanting. For he says:
"What we look for is the conscience of the giver to cleanse that of the recipient." But supposing
the conscience of the giver is concealed from view, and perhaps defiled with sin, how
will it be able to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, if, as he says, "what we look for is
the conscience of the giver to cleanse that of the recipient?" For if he should say that it makes
<note type="footnote">1920 Ps. cxx. 7; cf. Hieron.</note>
<note type="footnote">1921 Probably Alypius.</note>

<pb n="986"/>
no matter to the recipient what amount of evil may lie concealed from view in the conscience
of the giver, perhaps that ignorance may have such a degree of efficacy as this, that a man
cannot be defiled by the guilt of the conscience of him from whom he receives baptism, so
long as he is unaware of it. Let it then be granted that the guilty conscience of his neighbor
cannot defile a man so long as he is unaware of it, but is it therefore clear that it can further
cleanse him from his own guilt?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
<pb n="987"/>
<head>Chapter 2.</head>
<p>3. Whence, then, is a man to be cleansed who receives baptism, when the
conscience of the giver is polluted without the knowledge of him who is to receive it? Especially
when he goes on to say, "For he who receives faith from the faithless receives not faith,
but guilt." There stands before us one that is faithless ready to baptize, and he who should
be baptized is ignorant of his faithlessness: what think you that he will receive? Faith, or
guilt? If you answer faith, then you will grant that it is possible that a man should receive
not guilt, but faith, from him that is faithless; and the former saying will be false, that "he
who receives faith from the faithless receives not faith, but guilt." For we find that it is possible
that a man should receive faith even from one that is faithless, if he be not aware of the
faithlessness of the giver. For he does not say, He who receives faith from one that is openly
and notoriously faithless; but he says, "He who receives faith from the faithless receives not
faith, but guilt;" which certainly is false when a person is baptized by one who hides his
faithlessness. But if he shall say, Even when the faithlessness of the baptizer is concealed,
the recipient receives not faith from him, but guilt, then let them rebaptize those who are
well known to have been baptized by men who in their own body have long concealed a life
of guilt, but have eventually been detected, convicted, and condemned.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="988"/>
<head>Chapter 3.</head>
<p>For, so long as they escaped detection, they could not bestow faith on any
whom they baptized, but only guilt, if it be true that whosoever receives faith from one that
is faithless receives not faith, but guilt. Let them therefore be baptized by the good, that
they may be enabled to receive not guilt, but faith.</p>
<p>4. But how, again, shall they have any certainty about the good who are to give them
faith, if what we look to is the conscience of the giver, which is unseen by the eyes of the
proposed recipient? Therefore, according to their judgment, the salvation of the spirit is
made uncertain, so long as in opposition to the holy Scriptures, which say, "It is better to
trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man,"1922 and, "Cursed be the man that trusteth
in man,"1923 they remove the hope of those who are to be baptized from the Lord their God,
and persuade them that it should be placed in man; the practical result of which is, that their
salvation becomes not merely uncertain, but actually null and void. For "salvation belongeth
unto the Lord,"1924 and "vain is the help of man."1925 Therefore, whosoever places his trust
in man, even in one whom he knows to be just and innocent, is accursed. Whence also the
Apostle Paul finds fault with those who said they were of Paul saying, "Was Paul crucified
for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"1926</p>

<head>Chapter 4.</head>
<p>5. Wherefore, if they were in error, and would have perished had they not
been corrected, who wished to be of Paul, what must we suppose to be the hope of those
who wished to be of Donatus? For they use their utmost endeavors to prove that the origin,
root, and head of the baptized person is none other than the individual by whom he is
baptized. The result is, that since it is very often a matter of uncertainty what kind of man
the baptizer is, the hope therefore of the baptized being of uncertain origin, of uncertain
root, of uncertain head, is of itself uncertain altogether. And since it is possible that the
conscience of the giver may be in such a condition as to be accursed and defiled without
the knowledge of the recipient, it results that, being of an accursed origin, accursed root,
accursed head, the hope of the baptized may prove to be vain and ungrounded. For Petilian
expressly states in his epistle, that "everything consists of an origin and root; and if it have
not something for a head, it is nothing." And since by the origin and root and head of the
baptized person he wishes to be understood the man by whom he is baptized, what good
does the unhappy recipient derive from the fact that he does not know how bad a man his
baptizer really is? For he does not know that he himself has a bad head, or actually no head
at all. And yet what hope can a man have, who, whether he is aware of it or not, has either
a very bad head or no head at all? Can we maintain that his very ignorance forms a head,
when his baptizer is either a bad head or none at all? Surely any one who thinks this is unmistakeably
without a head.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
<pb n="990"/>
<head>Chapter 5.</head>
<p>6. We ask, therefore, since he says, "He who receives faith from the faithless
receives not faith, but guilt," and immediately adds to this the further statement, that
"everything consists of an origin and root; and if it have not something for a head, it is
nothing;"—we ask, I say, in a case where the faithlessness of the baptizer is undetected: If
then, the man whom he baptizes receives faith, and not guilt; if, then, the baptizer is not his
origin and root and head, who is it from whom he receives faith? where is the origin from
which he springs? where is the root of which he is a shoot? where the head which is his
starting-point? Can it be, that when he who is baptized is unaware of the faithlessness of
his baptizer, it is then Christ who gives faith, it is then Christ who is the origin and root and
head? Alas for human rashness and conceit! Why do you not allow that it is always Christ
who gives faith, for the purpose of making a man a Christian by giving it? Why do you not
allow that Christ is always the origin of the Christian, that the Christian always plants his
root in Christ, that Christ is the head of the Christian? Do we then maintain that, even
when spiritual grace is dispensed to those that believe by the hands of a holy and faithful
minister, it is still not the minister himself who justifies, but that One of whom it is said,
that "He justifieth the ungodly?" 1927 But unless we admit this, either the Apostle Paul was
the head and origin of those whom he had planted, or Apollos the root of those whom he
had watered, rather than He who had given them faith in believing; whereas the same Paul
says, "I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase: so then neither is he that
planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase."1928 Nor was the
apostle himself their root, but rather He who says, "I am the vine, ye are the branches."1929
How, too, could he be their head, when he says, that "we, being many, are one body in
Christ,"1930 and expressly declares in many passages that Christ Himself is the head of the
whole body?</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="991"/>
<head>Chapter 6.</head>
<p>7. Wherefore, whether a man receive the sacrament of baptism from a
faithful or a faithless minister, his whole hope is in Christ, that he fall not under the condemnation
that "cursed is he that placeth his hope in man." Otherwise, if each man is born again
in spiritual grace of the same sort as he by whom he is baptized, and if when he who baptizes
him is manifestly a good man, then he himself gives faith, he is himself the origin and root
and head of him who is being born; whilst, when the baptizer is faithless without its being
known, then the baptized person receives faith from Christ, then he derives his origin from
Christ, then he is rooted in Christ, then he boasts in Christ as his head,—in that case all who
are baptized should wish that they might have faithless baptizers, and be ignorant of their
faithlessness: for however good their baptizers might have been, Christ is certainly beyond
comparison better still; and He will then be the head of the baptized, if the faithlessness of
the baptizer shall escape detection.</p>

<head>Chapter 7.</head>
<p>8. But if it is perfect madness to hold such a view (for it is Christ always
that justifieth the ungodly, by changing his ungodliness into Christianity; it is from Christ
always that faith is received, Christ is always the origin of the regenerate and the head of
the Church), what weight, then, will those words have, which thoughtless readers value by
their sound, without inquiring what their inner meaning is? For the man who does not
content himself with hearing the words with his ear, but considers the meaning of the phrase,
when he hears, "What we look to is the conscience of the giver, that it may cleanse the conscience
of the recipient," will answer, The conscience of man is often unknown to me, but
I am certain of the mercy of Christ: when he hears, "He who receives faith from the faithless
receives not faith, but guilt," will answer, Christ is not faithless, from whom I receive not
guilt, but faith: when he hears, "Everything consists of an origin and root; and if it have not
something for a head, is nothing," will answer, My origin is Christ, my root is Christ, my
head is Christ. When he hears, "Nor does anything well receive second birth, unless it be
born again of good seed," he will answer, The seed of which I am born again is the Word of
God, which I am warned to hear with attention, even though he through whom I hear it
does not himself do what he preaches; according to the words of the Lord, which make me
herein safe, "All whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after
their works: for they say, and do not."1931 When he hears, "What perversity must it be, that
he who is guilty through his own sins should make another free from guilt!" he will answer,
No one makes me free from guilt but He who died for our sins, and rose again for our justification.
For I believe, not in the minister by whose hands I am baptized, but in Him who
justifieth the ungodly, that my faith may be counted unto me for righteousness.1932</p>

<p>9. When he hears, "Every good tree bringeth good fruit, but a corrupt tree
bringeth forth evil fruit: do men gather grapes of thorns?"1933 and, "A good man out of the
good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure
bringeth forth evil things;"1934 he will answer, This therefore is good fruit, that I should be
a good tree, that is, a good man, that I should show forth good fruit, that is, good works.
But this will be given to me, not by him that planteth, nor by him that watereth, but by God
that giveth the increase. For if the good tree be the good baptizer, so that his good fruit
should be the man whom he baptizes, then any one who has been baptized by a bad man,
even if his wickedness be not manifest, will have no power to be good, for he is sprung from
an evil tree. For a good tree is one thing; a tree whose quality is concealed, but yet bad, is
another. Or if, when the tree is bad, but hides its badness, then whosoever is baptized by it
is born not of it, but of Christ; then they are justified with more perfect holiness who are
baptized by the bad who hide their evil nature, than they who are baptized by the manifestly
good.1935</p>

<p>10. Again, when he hears, "He that is washed by one dead, his washing
profiteth him nought,"1936 he will answer, "Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no
more; death hath no more dominion over Him:"1937 of whom it is said, "The same is He
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."1938 But they are baptized by the dead, who are
baptized in the temples of idols. For even they themselves do not suppose that they receive
the sanctification which they look for from their priests, but from their gods; and since these
were men, and are dead in such sort as to be now neither upon earth nor in the rest of
heaven,1939 they are truly baptized by the dead: and the same answer will hold good if there
be any other way in which these words of holy Scripture may be examined, and profitably
discussed and understood. For if in this place I understand a baptizer who is a sinner, the
same absurdity will follow, that whosoever has been baptized by an ungodly man, even
though his ungodliness be undiscovered, is yet washed in vain, as though baptized by one
dead. For he does not say, He that is baptized by one manifestly dead, but absolutely, "by
one dead." And if they consider any man to be dead whom they know to be a sinner, but
any one in their communion to be alive, even though he manages most adroitly to conceal
a life of wickedness, in the first place with accursed pride they claim more for themselves
than they ascribe to God, that when a sinner is unveiled to them he should be called dead,
but when he is known by God he is held to be alive. In the next place, if that sinner is to be
called dead who is known to be such by men, what answer will they make about Optatus,
whom they were afraid to condemn though they had long known his wickedness? Why are
those who were baptized by him not said to have been baptized by one dead? Did he live
because the Count was his faith?1940—an elegant and well-turned saying of some early colleagues
of their own, which they themselves are wont to quote with pride, not understanding
that at the death of the haughty Goliath it was his own sword by which his head was cut
off.1941</p>
<note type="footnote">1936 So the Donatists commonly quoted Ecclus. xxiv. 25, which is more correctly rendered in our version,
"He that washeth himself after touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his washing?" Augustin
(Retractt. i. 21, 3) says that the misapplication was rendered possible by the omission in many African Mss. of
the second clause, "and touches it again." Cp. Hieron, Ecclus. xxxiv. 30.</note>

<p>11. Lastly, if they are willing to give the name of dead neither to the wicked
man whose sin is hidden, nor to him whose sin is manifest, but who has yet not been condemned
by them, but only to him whose sin is manifest and condemned, so that whosoever
is baptized by him is himself baptized by the dead, and his washing profits him nothing;
what are we to say of those whom their own party have condemned "by the unimpeachable
voice of a plenary Council,"1942 together with Maximianus and the others who ordained
him,—I mean Felicianus of Musti, and Prætextatus of Assura, of whom I speak in the
meantime, who are counted among the twelve ordainers of Maximianus, as erecting an altar
in opposition to their altar at which Primianus stands? They surely are reckoned by them
among the dead. To this we have the express testimony of the noble decree of that Council
of theirs which formerly called forth shouts of unreserved 1943 applause when it was recited
among them for the purpose of being decreed, but which would now be received in silence
if we should chance to recite it in their ears; whereas they should rather have been slow at
first to rejoice in its eloquence, lest they should afterwards come to mourn over it when its
credit was destroyed. For in it they speak in the following terms of the followers of Maximianus,
who were shut out from their communion: "Seeing that the shipwrecked members
of certain men have been dashed by the waves of truth upon the sharp rocks, and after the
fashion of the Egyptians, the shores are covered with the bodies of the dying; whose punishment
is intensified in death itself, since after their life has been wrung from them by the
avenging waters, they fail to find so much as burial." In such gross terms indeed, do they
insult those who were guilty of schism from their body, that they call them dead and unburied;
but certainly they ought to have wished that they might obtain burial, if it were only
that they might not have seen Optatus Gildonianus advancing with a military force, and
like a sweeping wave that dashes beyond its fellows, sucking back Felicianus and Prætextatus
once again within their pale, out of the multitude of bodies lying unburied on the shore.</p>

<p>12. Of these I would ask, whether by coming to their sea they were restored
to life, or whether they are still dead there? For if still they are none the less corpses, then
the laver cannot in any way profit those who are baptized by such dead men. But if they
have been restored to life, yet how can the laver profit those whom they baptized before
outside, while they were lying without life, if the passage, "He who is baptized by the dead,
of what profit is his baptism to him," is to be understood in the way in which they think?
For those whom Prætextatus and Felicianus baptized while they were yet in communion
with Maximianus are now retained among them, sharing in their communion, without being
again baptized, together with the same men who baptized them—I mean Felicianus and
Prætextatus: taking occasion by which fact, if it were not that they cherish the beginning
of their own obstinacy, instead of considering the certain end of their spiritual salvation,
they would certainly be bound to vigilance, and ought to recover the soundness of their
senses, so as to breathe again in Catholic peace; if only, laying aside the swelling of their
pride, and overcoming the madness of their stubbornness, they would take heed and see
what monstrous sacrilege it is to curse the baptism of the foreign churches, which we have
learned from the sacred books were planted in primitive times, and to receive the baptism
of the followers of Maximianus, whom they have condemned with their own lips.</p>

<p>13. But our brethren themselves, the sons of the aforesaid churches, were
both ignorant at the time, and still are ignorant, of what has been done so many years ago
in Africa: wherefore they at any rate cannot be defiled by the charges which have been
brought, on the part of the Donatists, against the Africans, without even knowing whether
they were true. But the Donatists having openly separated and divided themselves off, although
they are even said to have taken part in the ordination of Primianus, yet condemned
the said Primianus, ordained another bishop in opposition to Primianus, baptized outside
the communion of Primianus, rebaptized after Primianus, and returned to Primianus with
their disciples who had been baptized by themselves outside, and never rebaptized by any
one inside. If such a union with the party of Maximianus does not pollute the Donatists,
how can the mere report concerning the Africans pollute the foreigners? If the lips meet
together without offense in the kiss of peace, which reciprocally condemned each other,
why is each man that is condemned by them in the churches very far removed by the intervening
sea from their jurisdiction, not saluted with a kiss as a faithful Catholic, but driven
forth with a blast of indignation as an impious pagan? And if, in receiving the followers of
Maximianus, they made peace in behalf of their own unity, far be it from us to find fault
with them, save that they cut their own throats by their decision, that whereas, to preserve
unity in their schism, they collect together again what had been parted from themselves,
they yet scorn to reunite their schism itself to the true unity of the Church.</p>

<p>14. If, in the interests of the unity of the party of Donatus, no one rebaptizes
those who were baptized in a wicked schism, and men, who are guilty of a crime of
such enormity as to be compared by them in their Council to those ancient authors of schism
whom the earth swallowed up alive,1944 are either unpunished after separation, or restored
again to their position after condemnation; why is it that, in defence of the unity of Christ,
which is spread throughout the whole inhabited world, of which it has been predicted that
it shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth,1945—a
prediction which seems from actual proof to be in process of fulfillment; why is it that, in
defence of this unity, they do not acknowledge the true and universal law of that inheritance
which rings forth from the books that are common to us all: "I shall give Thee the heathen
for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession?"1946 In behalf
of the unity of Donatus, they are not compelled to call together again what they have scattered
abroad, but are warned to hear the cry of the Scriptures: why will they not understand that
they meet with such treatment through the mercy of God, that since they brought false
charges against the Catholic Church, by contact as it were with which they were unwilling
to defile their own excessive sanctity, they should be compelled by the sovereign authority
of Optatus Gildonianus to receive again and associate with themselves true offenses of the
greatest enormity, condemned by the true voice, as they say, of their own plenary Council?
Let them at length perceive how they are filled with the true crimes of their own party, after
inventing fictitious crimes wherewith to charge their brethren, when, even if the charges
had been true, they ought at length to feel how much should be endured in the cause of
peace, and in behalf of Christ’s peace to return to a Church which did not condemn crimes
undiscovered, if on behalf of the peace of Donatus they were ready to pardon such as were
condemned.</p>

and corrected on the one point of their conduct in the matter of the followers of Maximianus.
We do not ransack ancient archives, we do not bring to light the contents of time honored
libraries, we do not publish our proofs to distant lands; but we bring in, as arbiters betwixt

remaining in this life and in this province who have severed themselves, and many from
whom they have severed themselves; many who have erected an altar, and many against
whom that altar has been erected; many who have condemned, and many who have been
condemned; who have received, and who have been received; who have been baptized outside,
and not baptized again within: if all these things in the cause of unity defile, let the defiled
hold their tongues; if these things in the cause of unity do not defile, let them submit to
correction, and terminate their strife.</p>

<p>7. As for the words which follow in his letter, the writer himself could
scarcely fail to laugh at them, when, having made an unlearned and lying use of the proof
in which he quotes the words of Scripture, "He who is washed by the dead, what profiteth
him his washing?" he endeavors to show to us "how far a traditor being still in life may be
accounted dead." And then he goes on further to say: "That man is dead who has not been
worthy to be born again in true baptism; he is likewise dead who, although born in genuine
baptism, has joined himself to a traditor." If, therefore, the followers of Maximianus are
not dead, why do the Donatists say, in their plenary Council, that "the shores are covered
with their dying bodies?" But if they are dead, whence is there life in the baptism which
they gave? Again, if Maximianus is not dead, why is a man baptized again who had been
baptized by him? But if he is dead why is not also Felicianus of Musti dead with him, who
ordained him, and might have died beyond the sea with some African colleague or another
who was a traditor? Or, if he also is himself dead, how is there life with him in your society
in those who, having been baptized outside by him who is dead, have never been baptized
again within?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">

<p>18. Then he further adds: "Both are without the life of baptism, both he
who never had it at all, and he who had it but has lost it." He therefore never had it, whom
Felicianus, the follower of Maximianus or Prætextatus, baptized outside; and these men
themselves have lost what once they had when, therefore, these were received with their
followers, who gave to those whom they baptized what previously they did not have? and
who restored to themselves what they had lost? But they took away with them the form of
baptism, but lost the veritable excellence of baptism by their wicked schism. Why do you
repudiate the form itself, which is holy at all times and all places, in the Catholics whom
you have not heard, whilst you are willing to acknowledge it in the followers of Maximianus
whom you have punished?</p>
<p>19. But whatever he seemed to himself to say by way of accusation about the traitor
Judas, I see not how it can concern us, who are not proved by them to have betrayed our
trust; nor, indeed, if such treason were proved on the part of any who before our time have
died in our communion, would that treason in any way defile us by whom it was disavowed,
and to whom it was displeasing. For if they themselves are not defiled by offenses condemned
by themselves, and afterwards condoned, how much less can we be defiled by what we have
disavowed so soon as we have heard of them! However weighty, therefore, his invective
against traditors, let him be assured that they are condemned by me in precisely the same
terms. But yet I make a distinction; for he accuses one on my side who has long been dead
without having been condemned in any investigation made by me. I point to a man adhering
closely to his side, who had been condemned by him, or at least had been separated by a
sacrilegious schism, and whom he received again with undiminished honor.</p>

<p>20. He says: "You who are a most abandoned traditor have come out in
the character of a persecutor and murderer of us who keep the law." If the followers of
Maximianus kept the law when they separated from you, then we may acknowledge you as
a keeper of the law, when you are separated from the Church spread abroad throughout the
world. But if you raise the question of persecutions, I at once reply: If you have suffered
anything unjustly, this does not concern those who, though they disapprove of men who
act in such a way,1949 yet endure them for the peace that is in unity, in a manner deserving
of all praise. Wherefore you have nothing to bring up against the Lord’s wheat, who endure
the chaff that is among them till the last winnowing, from whom you never would have
separated yourself, had you not shown yourself lighter than chaff by flying away under the
blast of temptation before the coming of the Winnower. But not to leave this one example,
which the Lord hath thrust back in their teeth, to close the mouths of these men, for their
correction if they will show themselves to be wise, but for their confusion if they remain in
their folly: if those are more just that suffer persecution than those who inflict it, then those
same followers of Maximianus are the more just, whose basilica was utterly overthrown,
and who were grievously maltreated by the military following of Optatus, when the mandates
of the proconsul, ordering that all of them should be shut out of the basilicas, were manifestly
procured by the followers of Primianus. Wherefore, if, when the emperors hated their
communion, they ventured on such violent measures for the persecution of the followers
of Maximianus, what would they do if they were enabled to work their will by being in
communion with kings? And if they did such things as I have mentioned for the correction
of the wicked, why are they surprised that Catholic emperors should decree with greater
power that they should be worked upon and corrected who endeavor to rebaptize the whole
Christian world, when they have no ground for differing from them? seeing that they,
themselves bear witness that it is right to bear with wicked men even where they have true
charges to bring against them in the cause of peace, since they received those whom they
had themselves condemned, acknowledging the honors conferred among themselves, and
the baptism administered in schism. Let them at length consider what treatment they deserve
at the hands of the Christian powers of the world, who are the enemies of Christian unity
throughout the world. If, therefore, correction be bitter, yet let them not fail to be ashamed;
lest when they begin to read what they themselves have written, they be overcome with
laughter, when they do not find in themselves what they wish to find in others, and fail to
recognize1950 in their own case what they find fault with in their neighbors.</p>

<p>21. What, then, does he mean by quoting in his letter the words with
which our Lord addressed the Jews: "Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and
wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye shall kill and crucify, and some of them shall
ye scourge?"1951 For if by the wise men and the scribes and the prophets they would have
themselves be understood, while we were as it were the persecutors of the prophets and wise
men, why are they unwilling to speak with us, seeing they are sent to us? For, indeed, if the
man who wrote that epistle which we are at this present moment answering, were to be
pressed by us to acknowledge it as his own, stamping its authenticity with his signature, I
question much whether he would do it, so thoroughly afraid are they of our possessing any
words of theirs. For when we were anxious by some means or other to procure the latter
part of this same letter, because those from whom we obtained it were unable to describe
the whole of it, no one who was asked for it was willing to give it to us, so soon as they knew
that we were making a reply to the portion which we had. Therefore, when they read how
the Lord says to the prophet, "Cry aloud, spare not, and write their sins with my pen," 1952
these men who are sent to us as prophets have no fears on this score, but take every precaution
that their crying may not be heard by us: which they certainly would not fear if what they
spoke of us were true. But their apprehension is not groundless, as it is written in the Psalm,
"The mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped."1953 For if the reason that they do not
receive our baptism be that we are a generation of vipers—to use the expression in his
epistle—why did they receive the baptism of the followers of Maximianus, of whom their
Council speaks in the following terms: "Because the enfolding of a poisoned womb has long
concealed the baneful offspring of a viper’s seed, and the moist concretions of conceived
iniquity have by slow heat flowed forth into the members of serpents"? Is it not therefore
of themselves also that it is said in the same Council, "The poison of asps is under their lips,
their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood; destruction
and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have they not known"?1954 And yet
they now hold these men themselves in undiminished honor, and receive within their body
those whom these men had baptized without.</p>

asps under their lips, and all the other things which they have said against those which have
not known the way of peace, are really, if they would but speak the truth, more strictly applicable
to themselves, since for the sake of the peace of Donatus they received the baptism
of these men, in respect of which they used the expressions quoted above in the wording of
the decree of the Council; but the baptism of the Church of Christ dispersed throughout
the world, from which peace itself came into Africa, they repudiate, to the sacrilegious
wounding of the peace of Christ. Which, therefore, are rather the false prophets, who come
in sheep’s clothing, while inwardly they are ravening wolves,1955—they who either fail to
detect the wicked in the Catholic Church, and communicate with them in all innocence, or
else for the sake of the peace of unity are bearing with those whom they cannot separate
from the threshing-floor of the Lord before the Winnower shall come, or they who do in
schism what they censure in the Catholic Church, and receive in their own separation, when
manifest to all and condemned by their own voice, what they profess that they shun in the
unity of the Church when it calls for toleration, and does not even certainly exist?</p>

them by their fruits:"1956 let us therefore examine into their fruits. You bring up against
our predecessors their delivery of the sacred books. This very charge we urge with greater
probability against their accusers themselves. And not to carry our search too far, in the
same city of Constantina your predecessors ordained Silvanus bishop at the very outset of
his schism. He, while he was still a subdeacon, was most unmistakeably entered as a traditor
in the archives of the city. 1957 If you on your side bring forward documents against our
predecessors, all that we ask is equal terms, that we should either believe both to be true or
both to be false. If both are true, you are unquestionably guilty of schism, who have pretended
that you avoid offenses in the communion of the whole world, which you had commonly
among you in the small fragment of your own sect. But again, if both are false, you are unquestionably
guilty of schism, who, on account of the false charges of giving up the sacred
books, are staining yourselves with the heinous offence of severance from the Church. But
if we have something to urge in accusation while you have nothing, or if our charges are
true whilst yours are false, it is no longer matter of discussion how thoroughly your mouths
are closed.</p>

false, while you had possession of some genuine proofs of delivery of the sacred books? what
would then remain for you, except that, if you would, you should show your love of peace,
or otherwise should hold your tongues?1958 For whatever, in that case, you might bring
forward in evidence, I should be able to say with the greatest ease and the most perfect truth,
that then you are bound to prove as much to the full and catholic unity of the Church already
spread abroad and established throughout so many nations, to the end that you should remain
within, and that those whom you convict should be expelled. And if you have endeavored
to do this, certainly you have not been able to make good your proof; and being vanquished
or enraged, you have separated yourselves, with all the heinous guilt of sacrilege, from the
guiltless men who could not condemn on insufficient proof. But if you have not even endeavored
to do this, then with most accursed and unnatural blindness you have cut yourselves
off from the wheat of Christ, which grows throughout His whole fields, that is, throughout
the whole world, until the end, because you have taken offense at a few tares in Africa.</p>

<p>25. In conclusion, the Testament is said to have been given to the flames
by certain men in the time of persecution. Now let its lessons be read, from whatever source
it has been brought to light. Certainly in the beginning of the promises of the Testator this
is found to have been said to Abraham: "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed;"1959 and this saying is truthfully interpreted by the apostle: "To thy seed," he says,
"which is Christ."1960 No betrayal on the part of any man has made the promises of God
of none effect. Hold communion with all the nations of the earth, and then you may boast
that you have preserved the Testament from the destruction of the flames. But if you will
not do so, which party is the rather to be believed to have insisted on the burning of the
Testament, save that which will not assent to its teaching when it is brought to light? For
how much more certainly, without any sacrilegious rashness, can he be held to have joined
the company of traditors who now persecutes with his tongue the Testament which they
are said to have persecuted with the flames! You charge us with the persecution: the true
wheat of the Lord answers you, "Either it was done justly, or it was done by the chaff that
was among us." What have you to say to this? You object that we have no baptism: the
same true wheat of the Lord answers you, that the form of the sacrament even within the
Church fails to profit some, as it did no good to Simon Magus when he was baptized, much
more it fails to profit those who are without. Yet that baptism remains in them when they
depart, is proved from this, that it is not restored to them when they return. Never, therefore,
except by the greatest shamelessness, will you be able to cry out against that wheat, or to
call them false prophets clad in sheep’s clothing, whilst inwardly they are ravening wolves;
since either they do not know the wicked in the unity of the Catholic Church, or for the
sake of unity bear with those whom they know.</p>

<p>26. But let us turn to the consideration of your fruits. I pass over the
tyrannous exercise of authority in the cities, and especially in the estates of other men; I pass
over the madness of the Circumcelliones, and the sacrilegious and profane adoration of the
bodies of those who had thrown themselves of their own accord over precipices, the revellings
of drunkenness, and the ten years’ groaning of the whole of Africa under the cruelty of the
one man Optatus Gildonanius: all this I pass over, because there are certain among you
who cry out that these things are, and have ever been displeasing to them. But they say that
they bore with them in the cause of peace, because they could not put them down; wherein
they condemn themselves by their own judgment: for if indeed they felt such love for peace,
they never would have rent in twain the bond of unity. For what madness can be greater,
than to be willing to abandon peace in the midst of peace itself, and to be anxious to retain
it in the midst of discord? Therefore, for the sake of those who pretend that they do not see
the evils of this same faction of Donatus, which all men see and blame, ignoring them even
to the extent of saying of Optatus himself, "What did he do?" "Who accused him?" "Who
convicted him?" "I know nothing," "I saw nothing," "I heard nothing,"—for the sake of
these, I say, who pretend that they are ignorant of what is generally notorious, the party of
Maximianus has arisen, through whom their eyes are opened, and their mouths are closed:
for they openly sever themselves; they openly erect altar against altar; they are openly in a
Council1961 called sacrilegious and vipers, and swift to shed blood, to be compared with
Dathan and Abiram and Korah, and are condemned in cutting terms of abhorrence; and
are as openly received again with undiminished honors in company with those whom they
have baptized. Such are the fruits of these men, who do all this for the peace of Donatus,
that they may clothe themselves in sheep’s clothing, and reject the peace of Christ
throughout the world that they may be ravening wolves within the fold.</p>

<p>27. I think that I have left unanswered none of the statements in the letter
of Donatus, so far at least as relates to what I have been able to find in that part of which we
are in possession. I should be glad if they would produce the other part as well, in case there
should be anything in it which does not admit of refutation. But as for these answers which
we have made to him, with the help of God, I admonish your Christian love, that ye not
only communicate them to those who seek for them, but also force them on those who show
no longing for them. Let them answer anything they will; and if they shrink from sending
a reply to us, let them at any rate send letters to their own party, only not forbidding that
the contents should be shown to us. For if they do this, they show their fruits most openly,
by which they are proved to demonstration to be ravening wolves disguised in sheep’s
clothing, in that they secretly lay snares for our sheep, and openly shrink from giving any
answer to the shepherds. We only lay to their charge the sin of schism, in which they are
all most thoroughly involved,—not the offenses of certain of their party, which some of
them declare to be displeasing to themselves. If they, on the other hand, abstain from
charging us with the sins of other men, they have nothing they can lay to our charge, and
therefore they are wholly unable to defend themselves from the charge of schism; because
it is by a wicked severance that they have separated themselves from the threshing-floor of
the Lord, and from the innocent company of the corn that is growing throughout the world,
on account of charges which either are false, and invented by themselves, or even if true,
involve the chaff alone.</p>

refute what he has introduced about Manichæus. Now, in respect of this, the only thing
that offends me is that he has censured a most pestilent and pernicious error—I mean the
heresy of the Manichæans—in terms of wholly inadequate severity, if indeed they amount
to censure at all, though the Catholic Church has broken down his defenses by the strongest
evidence of truth.1962 For the inheritance of Christ, established in all nations, is secure
against heresies which have been shut out from the inheritance; but, as the Lord says, "How
can Satan cast out Satan?"1963 so how can the error of the Donatists have power to overthrow
the error of the Manichæans?1964</p>

<p>29. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, though that error is exposed and
overcome in many ways, and dare not oppose the truth on any show of reason whatsoever,
but only with the unblushing obstinacy of impudence; yet, not to load your memory with
a multitude of proofs, I would have you bear in mind this one action of the followers of
Maximianus, confront them with this one fact, thrust this in their teeth, to make them their
treacherous tongues, destroy their calumny with this, as it were a three-pronged dart destroying
a three-headed monster. They charge us with betrayal of the sacred books; they
charge us with persecution; they charge us with false baptism: to all their charges make the
same answer about the followers of Maximianus. For they think that the proofs are lost
which show that their predecessors gave the sacred volumes to the flames; but this at least
they cannot hide, that they have received with unimpaired honors those who were stained
with the sacrilege of schism. Also they think that those most violent persecutions are hidden,
which they direct against any who oppose them whenever they are able; but whilst spiritual
persecution surpasses bodily persecution, they received with undiminished honors the followers
of Maximianus, whom they themselves persecuted in the body, and of whom they
themselves said, "Their feet are swift to shed blood;"1965 and this at any rate they cannot
hide.</p>

<p>Finally, they think that the question of baptism is hidden, with which they
deceive wretched souls. But whilst they say that none have baptism who were baptized
outside the communion of the one Church, they received with undiminished honors the
followers of Maximianus, with those whom they baptized in schism outside the Donatist
communion, and this at least they cannot hide.</p>
<p>30. "But these things," they say, "bring no pollution in the cause of peace; and it is well
to bend to mercy the rigor of extreme severity, that broken branches may be grafted in
anew." Accordingly, in this way the whole question is settled, by defeat in them, by the impossibility
of defeat for us; for if the name of peace be assumed for even the faintest shadow
of defense to justify the bearing with wicked men in schism, then beyond all doubt the violation
of true peace itself involves detestable guilt, with nothing to be said in its defence
throughout the unity of the world.</p>

<p>31. These things, brethren, I would have you retain as the basis of your
action and preaching with untiring gentleness: love men, while you destroy errors; take of
the truth without pride; strive for the truth without cruelty. Pray for those whom you refute
and convince of error. For the prophet prays to God for mercy upon such as these, saying,
"Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Thy name, O Lord." 1966 And this, indeed,
the Lord has done already, so as to fill the faces of the followers of Maximianus with shame
in the sight of all mankind: it only remains that they should learn how to blush to their
soul’s health. For so they will be able to seek the name of the Lord, from which they are
turned away to their utter destruction, whilst they exalt their own name in the place of that
of Christ. May ye live and persevere in Christ, and be multiplied, and abound in the love
of God, and in love towards one another, and towards all men, brethren well beloved.</p>

<p>In which Augustin replies to all the several statements in the letter of Petilianus, as though
disputing with an adversary face to face.</p>

<p>1. That we made a full and sufficient answer to the first part of the letter
of Petilianus, which was all that we had been able to find, will be remembered by all who
were able to read or hear what we replied. But since the whole of it was afterwards found
and copied by our brethren, and sent to us with the view that we should answer it as a whole,
this task was one which our pen could not escape,—not that he says anything new in it, to
which answer has not been already made in many ways and at various times; but still, on
account of the brethren of slower comprehension, who, when they read a matter in any
place, cannot always refer to everything that has been said upon the same subject, I will
comply with those who urge me by all means to reply to every point, and that as though we
were carrying on the discussion face to face in the form of a dialogue. I will set down the
words of his epistle under his name, and I will give the answer under my own name, as
though it had all been taken down by reporters while we were debating. And so there will
be no one who can complain either that I have passed anything over, or that they have been
unable to understand it for want of distinction between the parties to the discussion; at the
same time that the Donatists themselves, who are unwilling to argue the question in our
presence, as is shown by the letters which they have circulated among their party, may thus
not fail to find the truth answering them point by point, just as though they were discussing
the matter with us face to face.</p>
<p>2. In the very beginning of the letter Petilianus said: "Petilianus, a bishop, to his wellbeloved
brethren, fellow-priests, and deacons, appointed ministers with us throughout our
diocese in the gospel, grace be to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord
Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>3. Augustin answered: I acknowledge the apostolic greeting. You see who you are that
employ it, but see from what source you have learned what you say. For in these terms Paul
salutes the Romans, and in the same terms the Corinthians, the Galatians, the Ephesians,
the Colossians, the Philippians, the Thessalonians. What madness is it, therefore, to be
unwilling to share the salvation of peace with those very Churches in whose epistles you
learned its form of salutation?</p>

<p>4. Petilianus said: "Those who have polluted their souls with a guilty laver,
under the name of baptism, reproach us with baptizing twice,—than whose obscenity, indeed,
any kind of filth is more cleanly, seeing that through a perversion of cleanliness they have
come to be made fouler by their washing."</p>
<p>5. Augustin answered: We are neither made fouler by our washing, nor cleaner by
yours. But when the water of baptism is given to any one in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, it is neither ours nor yours, but His of whom it was said to
John, "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same
is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."1968</p>

cleanse that of the recipient."</p>
<p>7. Augustin answered: We therefore need have no anxiety about the conscience of
Christ. But if you assert any man to be the giver, be he who he may, there will be no certainty
about the cleansing of the recipient, because there is no certainty about the conscience of
the giver.</p>

guilt but faith. For he believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, that his faith may be
counted for righteousness.1969</p>

<p>10. Petilianus said: "For everything consists of an origin and root; and if
it have not something for a head, it is nothing: nor does anything well receive second birth,
unless it be born again of good seed."</p>
<p>11. Augustin answered: Why will you put yourself forward in the room of Christ, when
you will not place yourself under Him? He is the origin, and root, and head of him who is
being born, and in Him we feel no fear, as we must in any man, whoever he may be, lest he
should prove to be false and of abandoned character, and we should be found to be sprung
from an abandoned source, growing from an abandoned root, united to an abandoned
head. For what man can feel secure about a man, when it is written, "Cursed be the man
that trusteth in man?"1970 But the seed of which we are born again is the word of God, that
is, the gospel. Whence the apostle says, "For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through
the gospel."1971 And yet he allows even those to preach the gospel who were preaching it
not in purity, and rejoices in their preaching;1972 because, although they were preaching it
not in purity, but seeking their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s,1973 yet the
gospel which they preached was pure. And the Lord had said of certain of like character,
"Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not yet after their works:
for they say, and do not."1974 If, therefore, what is in itself pure is preached in purity, then
the preacher himself also, in that he is a partner with the word, has his share in begetting
the believer; but if he himself be not regenerate, and yet what he preaches be pure, then the
believer is born not from the barrenness of the minister but from the fruitfulness of the
word.</p>

<p>12. Petilianus said: "This being the case, brethren, what perversity must
it be, that he who is guilty through his own sins should make another free from guilt, when
the Lord Jesus Christ says, ‘Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree
bringeth forth evil fruit: do men gather grapes of thorns?’1975 And again: ‘A good man,
out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of
the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things.’"1976</p>
<p>13. Augustin answered: No man, even though he be not guilty through his own sins,
can make his neighbor free from sin, because he is not God. Otherwise, if we were to expect
that out of the innocence of the baptizer should be produced the innocence of the baptized,
then each will be the more innocent in proportion as he may have found a more innocent
person by whom to be baptized; and will himself be the less innocent in proportion as he
by whom he is baptized is less innocent. And if the man who baptizes happens to entertain
hatred against another man, this will also be imputed to him who is baptized. Why, therefore,
does the wretched man hasten to be baptized,—that his own sins may be forgiven him, or
that those of others may be reckoned against him? Is he like a merchant ship, to discharge
one burden, and to take on him another? But by the good tree and its good fruit, and the
corrupt tree and its evil fruit, we are wont to understand men and their works, as is consequently
shown in those other words which you also quoted: "A good man, out of the good
treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure,
bringeth forth evil things." But when a man preaches the word of God, or administers the
sacraments of God, he does not, if he is a bad man, preach or minister out of his own
treasure; but he will be counted among those of whom it is said, "Whatsoever they bid you
observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works:" for they bid you observe what
is God’s, but their works are their own. For if it is as you say, that is, if the fruit of those
who baptize consist in the baptized persons themselves, you declare a great woe against
Africa, if a young Optatus has sprung up for every one that Optatus baptized.</p>

<p>14. Petilianus said: "And again, ‘He who is baptized by one that is dead,
his washing profiteth him nothing.’1977 He did not mean that the baptizer was a corpse, a
lifeless body, the remains of a man ready for burial, but one lacking the Spirit of God, who
is compared to a dead body, as He declares to a disciple in another place, according to the
witness of the gospel. For His disciple says, ‘Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
But Jesus said unto him, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.’1978 The father of the
disciple was not baptized. He declared him as a pagan to belong to the company of pagans;
unless he said this of the unbelieving, The dead cannot bury the dead. He was dead, therefore,
not as smitten by some death, but as smitten even during life. For he who so lives as to be
doomed to eternal death is tortured by a death in life. To be baptized, therefore, by the
dead, is to have received not life but death. We must therefore consider and declare how
far the traditor is to be accounted dead while yet alive. He is dead who has not deserved to
be born again with a true baptism; he is likewise dead who, having been born again with a
true baptism, has become involved with a traditor. Both are wanting in the life of baptism,—
both he who never had it at all, and he who had it and has lost it. For the Lord Jesus
Christ says, ‘There shall come to that man seven spirits more wicked than the former one,
and the last state of that man shall be worse than the first.’"1979</p>
<p>15. Augustin answered: Seek with greater care to know in what sense the words which
you have quoted from Scripture in proof of your position were really uttered, and how they
should be understood. For that all unrighteous persons are wont to be called dead in a
mystical sense is clear enough; but Christ, to whom true baptism belongs, which you say is
false because of the faults of men, is alive, sitting at the right hand of the Father, and He will
not die any more through any infirmity of the flesh: death will no more have dominion
over Him.1980 And they who are baptized with His baptism are not baptized by one who
is dead. And if it so happen that certain ministers, being deceitful workers, seeking their
own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s, proclaiming the gospel not in purity, and
preaching Christ of contention and envy, are to be called dead because of their unrighteousness,
yet the sacrament of the living God does not die even in one that is dead. For that Simon
was dead who was baptized by Philip in Samaria, who wished to purchase the gift of God
for money; but the baptism which he had lived in him still to work his punishment.1981</p>
<p>16. But how false the statement is which you make, that "both are wanting in the life
of baptism, both he who never had it at all, and he who had it and has lost it," you may see

<pb n="1023"/>
from this, that in the case of those who apostatize after having been baptized, and who return
through penitence, baptism is not restored to them, as it would be restored if it were lost.
In what manner, indeed, do your dead men baptize according to your interpretation? Must
we not reckon the drunken among the dead (to say nothing of the rest, and to mention only
what is well known and of daily experience among all), seeing that the apostle says of the
widow, "But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth?"1982 In the next place, in
that Council of yours, in which you condemned Maximianus with his advisers or his ministers,
have you forgotten with what eloquence you said, "Even after the manner of the Egyptians,
the shores are full of the bodies of the dying, on whom the weightier punishment falls
in death itself, in that, after their life has been wrung from them by the avenging waters,
they have not found so much as burial?" And yet you yourselves may see whether or no
one of them, Felicianus, has been brought to life again; yet he has with him within the
communion of your body those whom he baptized outside. As therefore he is baptized by
One that is alive, who is clothed with the baptism of the living Christ, so he is baptized by
the dead who is wrapped in the baptism of the dead Saturn, or any one like him; that we
may set forth in the meanwhile, with what brevity we may, in what sense the words which
you have quoted may be understood without any cavilling on the part of any one of us. For,
in the sense in which they are received by you, you make no effort to explain them, but only
strive to entangle us together with yourselves.</p>

<p>17. Petilianus said: "We must consider, I say, and declare how far the
treacherous traditor is to be accounted dead while yet in life. Judas was an apostle when
he betrayed Christ; and the same man was already dead, having spiritually lost the office of
an apostle, being destined afterwards to die by hanging himself, as it is written: ‘I have
sinned,’ says he, ‘in that I have betrayed the innocent blood; and he departed, and went and
hanged himself.’1983 The traitor perished by the rope: he left the rope for others like himself,
of whom the Lord Christ cried aloud to the Father, ‘Father, those that Thou gavest me I
have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be
fulfilled.’1984 For David of old had passed this sentence on him who was to betray Christ
to the unbelievers: ‘Let another take his office. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife
a widow.’1985 See how mighty is the spirit of the prophets, that it was able to see all future
things as though they were present, so that a traitor who was to be born hereafter should
be condemned many centuries before. Finally, that the said sentence should be completed,
the holy Matthias received the bishopric of that lost apostle. Let no one be so dull, no one
so faithless, as to dispute this: Matthias won for himself a victory, not a wrong, in that he
carried off the spoils of the traitor from the victory of the Lord Christ. Why then, after this,
do you claim to yourself a bishopric as the heir of a worse traitor? Judas betrayed Christ in
the flesh to the unbelievers; you in the spirit madly betrayed the holy gospel to the flames
of sacrilege. Judas betrayed the Lawgiver to the unbelievers; you, as it were, betraying all
that he had left, gave up the law of God to be destroyed by men. Whilst, had you loved the
law, like the youthful Maccabees, you would have welcomed death for the sake of the laws
of God (if indeed that can be said to be death to men which makes them immortal because
they died for the Lord); for of those brethren we learn that one replied to the sacrilegious
tyrant with these words of faith: ‘Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life; but the
King of the world (who reigns for ever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end) shall raise
us up who have died for His laws, unto everlasting life.’ 1986 If you were to burn with fire
the testament of a dead man, would you not be punished as the falsifier of a will? What
therefore is likely to become of you who have burned the most holy law of our God and
Judge? Judas repented of his deed even in death; you not only do not repent, but stand forth
as a persecutor and butcher of us who keep the law, whilst you are the most wicked of
traditors."</p>

your charge is false; you will never be able to prove it,—will not all that smoke of mighty
words presently vanish away? Or will you perchance endeavor to prove the truth of what
you say? This, then, you should do first; and then you might rise against us, as against men
who were already convicted, with whatever mass of invective you might choose. Here is
one absurdity: behold again a second.</p>
<p>19. You yourself, when speaking of the foretelling of the condemnation of Judas, used
these expressions: "See how mighty is the spirit of the prophets, that it was able to see all
future things as though they were present, so that a traitor who was to be born hereafter
should be condemned many centuries before;" and yet you did not see that in the same sure
prophecy, and certain and unshaken truth, in which it was foretold that one of the disciples
should hereafter betray the Christ; it was also foretold that the whole world should hereafter
believe in Christ. Why did you pay attention in the prophecy to the man who betrayed
Christ, and in the same place give no heed to the world for which Christ was betrayed?
Who betrayed Christ? Judas. To whom did he betray Him? To the Jews. What did the
Jews do to Him? "They pierced my hands and my feet," says the Psalmist. "I may tell all my
bones: they look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and cast lots
upon my vesture."1987 Of what importance, then, that is which is bought at such a price, I
would have you read a little later in the psalm itself: "All the ends of the world shall remember
and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee. For
the kingdom is the Lord’s; and He is the governor among the nations."1988 But who is able
to suffice for the quotation of all the other innumerable prophetic passages which bear witness
to the world that is destined to believe? Yet you quote a prophecy because you see in it the
man who sold Christ: you do not see in it the possession which Christ bought by being
sold. Here is the second absurdity: behold again the third.</p>
<p>20. Among the many other expressions in your invective, you said: "If you were to
burn with fire the testament of a dead man, would you not be punished as the falsifier of a
will? What therefore is likely to become of you who have burned the most holy law of our
God and Judge?" In these words you have paid no attention to what certainly ought to have
moved you, to the question of how it might be that we should burn the testament, and yet
<note type="footnote">1987 Ps. xxii. 16-18.</note>

<pb n="1026"/>
stand fast in the inheritance which was described in that testament; but it is marvellous that
you have preserved the testament and lost the inheritance. Is it not written in that testament,
"Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts
of the earth for thy possession"?1989 Take part in this inheritance, and you may bring what
charges you will against me about the testament. For what madness is it, that while you
shrank from committing the testament to the flames, you should yet strive against the words
of the testator! We, on the other hand, though we hold in our hands the records of the
Church and of the State, in which we read that those who ordained a rival bishop1990 in
opposition to Cæcilianus were rather the betrayers of the sacred books, yet do not on this
account insult you, or pursue you with invectives, or mourn over the ashes of the sacred
pages in your hands, or contrast the burning torments of the Maccabees with the sacrilege
of your fear, saying, "You should deliver your own limbs to the flames rather than the utterances
of God." For we are unwilling to be so absurd as to excite an empty uproar against
you on account of the deeds of others, which you either know nothing of, or else repudiate.
But in that we see you separated from the communion of the whole world (a sin both of the
greatest magnitude, and manifest to all mankind, and common to you all), if I were desirous
of exaggerating, I should find time failing me sooner than words. And if you should seek
to defend yourself on this charge, it could only be by bringing accusations against the whole
world, of such a kind that, if they could be maintained, you would simply be furnishing
matter for further accusation against yourself; if they could not be maintained, there is in
them no defence for you. Why therefore do you puff yourself up against me about the betrayal
of the sacred books, which concerns neither you nor me if we abide by the agreement
not to charge each other with the sins of other men: and which, if that agreement does not
stand, affects you rather than me? And, yet, even without any violation of that agreement,
I think I may say with perfect justice that he should be deemed a partner with him who delivered
up Christ who has not delivered himself up to Christ in company with the whole
world. "Then," says the apostle, "then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the
promise."1991 And again he says, "Heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ."1992 And the
same apostle shows that the seed of Abraham belongs to all nations from the promise which
was given to Abraham, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."1993
Wherefore I consider that I am only making a fair demand in asking that we should for a
moment consider the testament of God, which has already long been opened, and that we

should consider every one to be himself an heir of the traitor whom we do not find to be a
joint-heir with Him whom he betrayed; that every one should belong to him who sold Christ
who denies that Christ has bought the whole world. For when He showed Himself after
His resurrection to His disciples, and gave His limbs to those who doubted, that they should
handle them, He says this to them, "For thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to
suffer, and to rise again from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of
sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."1994 See
from what an inheritance you estrange yourselves! see what an Heir you resist! Can it really
be that a man would spare Christ if He were walking here on earth who speaks against Him
while He sits in heaven? Do you not yet understand that whatever you allege against us you
allege against His words? A Christian world is promised and believed in: the promise is
fulfilled, and it is denied. Consider, I entreat of you, what you ought to suffer for such impiety.
And yet, if I know not what you have suffered,—if I have not seen it, have not wrought
it,—then do you to-day, who do not suffer the violence of my persecution, render to me an
account of your separation. But you are likely to say over and over again what, unless you
prove it, can affect no one, and if you prove it, has no bearing upon me.</p>

<p>23. Petilianus said: "Did the apostle persecute any one? or did Christ
betray any one?"</p>
<p>24. Augustin answered: I might indeed say that Satan himself was worse than all wicked
men; and yet the apostle delivered a man over to him for the destruction of the flesh, that
his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.1995 And in the same way he delivered
over others, of whom he says, "Whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not
to blaspheme."1996 And the Lord Christ drove out the impious merchants from the temple
with scourges; in which connection we also find advanced the testimony of Scripture, where
it says, "The zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up."1997 So that we do find the apostle delivering
over to condemnation, and Christ a persecutor. All this I might say, and put you
into no small heat and perturbation, so that you would be compelled to inquire, not into
the complaints of those who suffer, but into the intention of those who cause the suffering.
But do not trouble yourself about this; I do not say this. But I do say that it has nothing to
do with the seed of Abraham, which is in all nations, if anything has been done to you which
ought not to have been done, perhaps by the chaff among the harvest of the Lord, which in
spite of this is found among all nations. Do you therefore render an account of your separation.
But first, consider what kind of men you have among you, with whom you would
not wish to be reproached; and see how unjustly you act, when you cast in our teeth the acts
of other men, even if you proved what you assert. Therefore it will be found that there is
no ground for your separation.</p>

<p>25. Petilianus said: "Yet some will be found to say, We are not the sons
of a traditor. Any one is the son of that man whose deeds he imitates. For those are most
assuredly sons, and at the same time bear a strong resemblance to their parents, who are
born in the likeness of their parents, not only as being of their flesh and blood, but in respect
of their characters and deeds."</p>
<p>26. Augustin answered: A little while ago you were saying nothing contrary to us, now
you even begin to say something in our favor. For this proposition of yours binds you to
as much as this, that if you shall fail to-day to convict us, with whom you are arguing, of
being traditors and murderers, and anything else with which you charge us, you will then
be wholly powerless to hurt us by any charge of the kind which you may prove against those
who have gone before us. For we cannot be the sons of those to whose deeds our actions
bear no resemblance. And see to what you have committed yourself. If you should be so
successful as to convict some man, even of our own times, and living with us, of any guilt
of the kind, that is in no way to the prejudice of all the nations of the earth who are blessed
in the seed of Abraham, by separating yourself from whom you are found to be guilty of
sacrilege. Accordingly, unless (as is altogether impossible) you are acquainted with all men
that exist throughout the world, and have not only made yourself familiar with all their
characters and deeds, but have also proved that they are as bad as you describe, you have
no ground for reproaching all the world, which is among the saints, with parentage of I
know not what description, to whom you prove that they are like. Nor will it help you at
all, even if you are able to show that those who are not of the same character take the holy
sacraments in common with those who are. In the first place, because you ought yourselves
to look at those with whom you celebrate those sacraments, to whom you give them, from
whom you receive them, and whom you would be unwilling to have cast up against you as
a reproach. And again, if all those are the sons of Judas, who was the devil among the
apostles, who imitate his deeds, why do we not call those of the sons of the apostles who
make such men partakers, not in their own deeds, but in the sacraments of the Lord, as the
apostles partook of the supper of the Lord in company with that traitor? and in this way
they are very different from you, who cast in the teeth of men who are striving for the preservation
of unity the very thing that you do to the rending asunder of unity.</p>

and liars in such terms as these: ‘Ye are the children of the devil, for he also was a slanderer
from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.’"</p>
<p>30. Augustin answered: We are not wont to say, "He was a slanderer," but "He was a
murderer."1999 But we ask how it was that the devil was a murderer from the beginning;
and we find that he slew the first man, not by drawing a sword, nor by applying to him any
bodily violence, but by persuading him to sin, and thus driving him from the happiness of
Paradise. What, then, was Paradise is now represented by the Church. Therefore those are
the sons of the devil who slay men by withdrawing them from the Church. But as by the
words of God we know what was the situation of Paradise, so now by the words of Christ
we have learned where the Church is to be found: "Throughout all nations," He says, "beginning
at Jerusalem." Whosoever, therefore, separates a man from that complete whole to
place him in any single part, is proved to be a son of the devil and a murderer. But see,
further, what is the application of the expression which you yourself employed in saying of
the devil, "He was a slanderer, and abode not in the truth." For you bring an accusation
against the whole world on account of the sins of others, though even those others themselves
you were more able to accuse than to convict; and you abode not in the truth of Christ. For
He says that the Church is "throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem;" but ye say that
it is in the party of Donatus.</p>

<p>31. Petilianus said: "In the third place, also, He calls the madness of persecutors
in like manner by this name, ‘Ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation
of hell? Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes;
and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues,
and persecute them from city to city: that upon you may come all the righteous
blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias,
son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.’2000 Are they then really
the sons of vipers according to the flesh, and not rather serpents in mind, and three-tongued
malice, and deadliness of touch, and burning with the spirit of poison? They have truly
become vipers, who by their bites have vomited forth death against the innocent people."</p>
<p>32. Augustin answered: If I were to say that this is said of men of character like unto
yourselves, you would reply, "Prove it." What then, have you proved it? Or if you think
that it is proved by the mere fact of its being uttered, there is no need to repeat the same
words. Pronounce the same judgment against yourselves as coming from us to you. See
you not that I too have proved it, if this amounts to proof? And yet I would have you learn
what is really meant by proof. For indeed I do not even seek for evidence from without to
enable me to prove you vipers. For be well assured that this very fact marks in you the
nature of vipers, that you have not in your mouth the foundation of truth, but the poison
of slanderous abuse, as it is written, "The poison of asps is under their lips."2001 And because
this might be said indiscriminately by any one against any one, as though it were asked,
Under whose lips? he immediately adds, "Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."2002
When, therefore, you say such things as this against men dispersed throughout the whole
world, of whom you know nothing whatsoever, and many of whom have never heard the
name either of Cæcilianus or of Donatus, and when you do not hear them answering amid
silence, Nothing of what you say has reference to us; we never saw it; we never did it; we are
totally at a loss to understand what you are saying,—seeing that you desire nothing else than
to say what you are entirely powerless to prove, how can you help allowing that your mouth
is full of cursing and bitterness? See, therefore, whether you can possibly show that you are
not vipers,2003 unless you show that all Christians throughout all nations of the world are
traditors, and murderers, and anything but Christians. Nay, in very truth, even though you
should be able to know and set before us the lives and deeds of every individual man
throughout the world, yet before you can do that, seeing that you act as you do without any
consideration, your mouth is that of a viper, your mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.

Show to us now, if you can, what prophet, what wise man, what scribe we have slain, or
crucified, or scourged in our synagogues. Look how much labor you have expended without
in any way being able to prove that Donatus and Marculus2004 were prophets, or wise men,
or scribes, because, in fact, they were nothing of the sort. But even if you could prove as
much as this, what progress would you have made towards proving that they had been killed
by us, when even we ourselves did not so much as know them? and how much less the whole
world, whom you calumniate with poisonous mouth?2005 Or whence will you be able to
prove that we have a spirit like that of those who murdered them, when you actually cannot
show that they were murdered by any one at all? Look carefully to all these points, see
whether you can prove any single one of them either about the whole world, or to the satisfaction
of the whole world,—in your persevering calumnies against which you show that
the charges are true in you, which you falsely propagate against the world.</p>
<p>33. Further, even if we should desire to prove you to be slayers of the prophets, it would
be too long a task to collect the evidence through all the several instances of the slaughter
which your infuriated leaders of the Circumcelliones, and the actual crowd of men inflamed
by wine and madness, not only have committed since the beginning of your schism, but
even continue to commit at the present time. To take the case nearest at hand. Let the divine
utterances be produced, which are commonly in the hands of both of us. Let us consider
those to be murderers of the prophets whom we find contradicting the words of the
prophets. What more learned definition could be given? What could admit of speedier
proof? You would be acting less cruelly in piercing the bodies of the prophets with a sword,
than in endeavoring to destroy the words of the prophets with your tongue. The prophet
says, "All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord."2006 Behold and
see how this is being done, how it is being fulfilled. But you not only close your ears in
disbelief against what is said, but you even thrust out your tongues in madness to speak
against what is already being done. Abraham heard the promise, "In thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed,"2007 and "he believed, and it was counted unto him for
righteousness."2008 You see the fact accomplished, and you cry out against it; and you will
not that it should be counted unto you for unrighteousness, as it fairly would be counted,

even if your refusal to believe was not on the accomplishment, but only on the utterance of
the prophecy. Nay, not only are you not willing that it should be counted unto you for unrighteousness,
but even what you suffer as the punishment of this impiety you would fain
have counted unto you for righteousness. Or if your conduct is not a persecution of the
prophets, because your instrument is not the sword but the tongue, what was the reason of
its being said under divine inspiration, "The sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
and their tongue a sharp sword"?2009 But what time would suffice me to collect from all
the prophets all the testimonies to the Church dispersed throughout the world, all of which
you endeavor to destroy and render nought by contradicting them? But you are caught; for
"their sound is gone out into all lands, and their words to the end of the world."2010 I will,
however, advance this one saying from the mouth of the Lord, who is the Witness of witnesses.
"All things must be fulfilled," He says, "which were written in the law of Moses, and
in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me." And what these were let us hear from
Himself: "Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures,
and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from
the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."2011 See what it is that is written in
the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning the Lord. See what
the Lord Himself revealed about Himself and about the Church, making Himself manifest,
uttering promises about the Church. But for you, see that you resist such manifest proofs
as these, and as you cannot destroy them, endeavor to pervert them, what would you do, if
you were to come across the bodies of the prophets, when you rage so madly against the
utterances of the prophets, as not even to hearken to the Lord when He is fulfilling, and
making manifest, and expounding the prophets? For do you not, to the utmost of`your
power, strive to slay the Lord Himself, since even to Himself you will not yield?</p>

<p>34. Petilianus said: "David also spoke of you as persecutors in the following
terms: ‘Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues have they deceived; the poison
of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift
to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of peace have
they not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes. Have all the workers of wickedness
no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread?’"2012</p>
<p>35. Augustin answered: Their throat is an open sepulchre, whence they breathe out
death by lies. For "the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul."2013 But if nothing is more true
than that which Christ said, that His Church should be throughout all nations, beginning
at Jerusalem, then there is nothing more false than that which you say, that it is in the party
of Donatus. But the tongues which have deceived are the tongues of those who, whilst they
are acquainted with their own deeds, not only say that they are just men, but that they are
justifiers of men, which is said of One only "that justifieth the ungodly,"2014 and that because
"He is just and the justifier."2015 As regards the poison of asps, and the mouth full of cursing
and bitterness, we have said enough already. But you have yourselves said that the followers
of Maximianus had feet swift to shed blood, as is testified by the sentence of your plenary
Council, so often quoted in the records of the proconsular province and of the state. But
they, so far as we hear, never killed any one in the body. You evidently, therefore, understood
that the blood of the soul was shed in spiritual murder by the sword of schism, which you
condemned in Maximianus. See then if your feet are not swift to shed blood, when you cut
off men from the unity of the whole world, if you were right in saying it of the followers of
Maximianus, because they cut off some from the party of Donatus. Are we again without
the knowledge of the way of peace, who study to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace? and yet do you possess that knowledge, who resist the discourse which Christ held
with His disciples after His resurrection, of so peaceful a nature that He began it with the
greeting, "Peace be unto you;"2016 and that so strenuously that you are proved to be saying
nothing less to Him than this, "What Thou saidst of the unity of all nations is false; what we
say of the offense of all nations is true"? Who would say such things as this if they had the
fear of God before their eyes? See, therefore, if in daily saying things like this you are not
trying to destroy the people of God dispersed throughout the world, eating them up as it
were bread.</p>

nor with those Churches which were founded by the labor of the apostles. Hereupon you
will say, "I do not communicate with traditors and murderers." The seed of Abraham answers
you, "These are those charges which you made, which are either not true, or have no reference

<p>40. Petilianus said: "Nor is it, after all, so strange that you assume to
yourself the name of bishop without authority. This is the true custom of the devil, to choose
in preference a mode of deceiving by which he usurps to himself a word of holy meaning,
as the apostle declares to us: ‘And no marvel,’ he says: ‘for Satan himself is transformed
into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as
the ministers of righteousness.’2019 Nor is it therefore a marvel if you falsely call yourself
a bishop. For even those fallen angels, lovers of the maidens of the world, who were corrupted
by the corruption of their flesh, though, from having stripped themselves of divine excellence,
they have ceased to be angels, yet retain the name of angels, and always esteem themselves
as angels, though, being released from the service of God, they have passed from the likeness
of their character into the army of the devil, as the great God declares, ‘My spirit shall not
always strive with man, for that he also is flesh.’2020 To those guilty ones and to you the
Lord Christ will say, ‘Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his angels.’2021 If there were no evil angels, the devil would have no angels; of
whom the apostle says, that in the judgment of the resurrection they shall be condemned
by the saints: ‘Know ye not,’ says he, ‘that we shall judge angels?’2022 If they were true angels,
men would not have authority to judge the angels of God. So too those sixty apostles, who,
when the twelve were left alone with the Lord Christ, departed in apostasy from the faith,
are so far yet considered among wretched men to be apostles, that from them Manichæus
and the rest entangle many souls in many devilish sects which they destroyed2023 that they
might take them in their snares. For indeed the fallen Manichæus, if fallen he was, is not
to be reckoned among those sixty, if it be that we can find his name as an apostle among
the twelve, or if he was ordained by the voice of Christ when Matthias was elected into the
place of the traitor Judas, or another thirteenth like Paul, who calls himself the last2024 of
the apostles, expressly that any one who was later than himself might not be held to be an
apostle. For these are his words: ‘For I am the last of the apostles, that am not meet to be
called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.’2025 And do not flatter yourselves
in this: he was a Jew that had done this. You too, as Gentiles, may work destruction upon
us. For you carry on war without license, against whom we may not fight in turn. For you
desire to live when you have murdered us; but our victory is either to escape or to be slain."</p>

<p>41. Augustin answered: See how you have quoted the testimony of holy Scripture, or
how you have understood it, when it has no bearing at all upon the present point at issue.
For all that you have brought forward was simply said to prove that there are false bishops,
just as there are false angels and false apostles. Now we too know quite well that there are
false angels and false apostles, and false bishops, and, as the true apostle says, false brethren
also;2026 but, seeing that charges such as yours may be brought by either side against the
other, what is required is a certain degree of proof, and not mere empty words. But if you
would see to which of us the charge of falseness more truly applies, recall to mind what we
have said before, and you will see it there set forth, that we may not become tedious to our
readers by repeating the same thing over and over again. And yet how is the Church dispersed
throughout the world affected either by what you may have found to say about its
chaff, which is mixed with it throughout the whole world; or by what you said of Manichæus
and the other devilish sects? For if the wheat is not affected by anything which is said even
about the chaff which is still mingled with it, how much less are the members of Christ dispersed
throughout the whole world affected by monstrosities2027 which have been so long
and so openly separated from it?2028</p>

<p>42. Petilianus said: "The Lord Jesus Christ commands us, saying, ‘When
they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another; and if they persecute you in that, flee
yet into a third; for verily I say unto you, ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till
the Son of man be come.’2029 If He gives us this warning in the case of Jews and pagans,
you who call yourself a Christian ought not to imitate the dreadful deeds of the Gentiles.
Or do you serve God in such wise that we should be murdered at your hands? You do err,
you do err, if you are wretched enough to entertain such a belief as this. For God does not
have butchers for His priests."</p>
<p>43. Augustin answered: To flee from one state to another from the face of persecution
has not been enjoined as precept or permission on heretics or schismatics, such as you are;
but it was enjoined on the preachers of the gospel, whom you resist. And this we may easily
prove in this wise: you are now in your own cities, and no man persecutes you. You must
therefore come forth, and give an account of your separation. For it cannot be maintained
that, as the weakness of the flesh is excused when it yields before the violence of persecution,
so truth also ought to yield to falsehood. Furthermore, if you are suffering persecution, why
do you not retire from the cities in which you are, that you may fulfill the instructions which
you quote out of the gospel? But if you are not suffering persecution, why are you unwilling
to reply to us? Or if the fact be that you are afraid lest, when you should have made reply,
you then should suffer persecution, in that case how are you following the example of those
preachers to whom it was said, "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves?"
To whom it was also further said "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
the soul."2030 And how do you escape the charge of acting contrary to the injunction of the
Apostle Peter, who says, "Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a
reason of the faith and hope that is in you?"2031 And, lastly, wherefore are you ever eager
to annoy the Catholic Churches by the most violent disturbances, whenever it is in your
power, as is proved by innumerable instances of simple fact? But you say that you must
defend your places, and that you resist with cudgels and massacres and with whatever else
you can. Wherefore in such a case did you not hearken to the voice of the Lord, when He
says, "But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil"? 2032 Or, allowing that it is possible that in
some cases it should be right for violent men to be resisted by bodily force, and that it does
not violate the precept which we receive from the Lord, "But I say unto you, that ye resist
not evil," why may it not also be that a pious man should eject an impious man, or a just
man him that is unjust, in the exercise of duly and lawfully constituted authority, from seats

which are unlawfully usurped, or retained to the despite of God? For you would not say
that the false prophets suffered persecution at the hands of Elijah, in the same sense that
Elijah suffered persecution from the wickedest of kings?2033 Or that because the Lord was
scourged by His persecutors, therefore those whom He Himself drove out of the temple
with scourges are to be put in comparison with His sufferings? It remains, therefore, that
we should acknowledge that there is no other question requiring solution, except whether
you have been pious or impious in separating yourselves from the communion of the whole
world. For if it shall be found that you have acted impiously, you would not be surprised
if there should be no lack of ministers of God by whom you might be scourged, seeing that
you suffer persecution not from us, but as it is written, from their own abominations.2034</p>

<p>44. Petilianus said: "The Lord Christ cries again from heaven to Paul,
‘Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.’2035 He
was then called Saul, that he might afterwards receive his true name in baptism. But for
you it is not hard so often to persecute Christ in the persons of His priests, though the Lord
Himself cries out, ‘Touch not mine anointed.’2036 Reckon up all the deaths of the saints,
and so often have you murdered Christ, who lives in each of them.2037 Lastly, if you are
not guilty of sacrilege, then a saint cannot be a murderer."</p>
<p>45. Augustin answered: Defend yourselves from the charge of the persecution which
those men suffered at the hands of your party who separated themselves from you with the
followers of Maximianus, and therein you will find our defence. For if you say that you
committed no such deeds, we simply read to you the records of the pro-consular province
and the state. If you say that you were right in persecuting them, why are you unwilling to
suffer the like yourselves? If you say, "But we caused no schism," then let this be inquired
into, and, till it is decided whether it be so or not, let no one make accusation against persecutors.
If you say that even schismatics ought not to have suffered persecution, I ask
whether it is also the case that they ought not to have been driven out of the basilicas, in
which they lay snares for the leading astray of the weak, even though it were done by duly
constituted authorities? If you say that this also should not have been done, first restore the
basilicas to the followers of Maximianus, and then discuss the point with us. If you say that
it was right, then see what they ought to suffer at the hands of duly constituted authority,
who, in resisting it, "resist the ordinance of God." Wherefore the apostle expressly says,
"For he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute
wrath on him that doeth evil." 2038 But even if this had been discovered after the truth had
been searched out with all diligence, that not even after public trial ought schismatics to
undergo any punishment, or be driven from the positions which they have occupied, for
their treachery and deceit; and if you should say that you are vexed that the followers of
Maximianus should have suffered such conduct at the hands of some of you,—why does
not the wheat of the Lord cry out with the more freedom from the whole field of the Lord,
that is, from the world, and say, Neither are we at all affected by what the tares and the chaff
amongst us do, seeing that it is contrary to our wish? If you confess that it is sufficient to

<pb n="1044"/>
clear you of responsibility, that all the evil that is done by men of your party is done in opposition
to your wishes, why then have you separated yourselves? For if your reason for
not separating from the unrighteous among the party of Donatus is that each man bears his
own burden, why have you separated yourselves from those throughout the world whom
you think, or profess to think, to be unrighteous? Is it that you might all share equally in
bearing the burden of schism?</p>
<p>46. And when we ask of you which of your party you can prove to have been slain by
us, I indeed can remember no law issued by the emperors to the effect that you should be
put to death. Those indeed whose deaths you quote most frequently to bring us into odium,
Marculus and Donatus, present a great question,—whether they threw themselves down a
precipice, as your teaching does not hesitate to encourage by examples of daily occurrence,
or whether they were thrown down by the true command of some authority. For if it is a
thing incredible that the leaders of the Circumcelliones should have wrought upon themselves
a death in accordance with their custom, how much more incredible it is that the Roman
authorities should have been able to condemn them to a punishment at variance with custom!
Accordingly, in considering this matter, which you think excessive in its hatefulness,
supposing what you say is true, what is there in it which bears upon the Lord’s wheat? Let
the chaff which flew away outside accuse the chaff which yet remained within for it is not
possible that it should all be separated till the winnowing at the last day. But if what you
say is false, what wonder is it if, when the chaff is carried away as it were by a light blast of
dissension, it even attacks the wheat of the Lord with false accusations? Wherefore, on the
consideration of all such odious accusations, the wheat of Christ, which is ordered to grow
together with the tares throughout the field, that is, throughout the whole world, makes this
answer to you with a free and fearless voice: If you cannot prove what you say, it has no
application to any one; and if you prove it, it yet does not apply to me. The result of which
is, that whosoever has separated himself from the unity of the wheat on account of the offenses
chargeable against the tares, or against the chaff, is unable to defend himself from
the charge of murder which is involved in the mere offense of dissension and schism, as the
Scripture says, "Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer."2039</p>

<p>47. Petilianus said: "Accordingly, as we have said, the Lord Christ cried,
‘Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he
said, Who art Thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Christ of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
And he, trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do? And
the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must
do.’ And so presently it goes on, ‘But Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were
opened, he saw no man.’ See here how blindness, coming in punishment of madness, obscures
the light in the eyes of the persecutor, not to be again expelled except by baptism!
Let us see, therefore, what he did in the city. ‘Ananias,’ it is said, ‘entered into the house to
Saul, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared
unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and
be filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales;
and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.’2040 Seeing therefore that
Paul, being freed by baptism from the offense of persecution, received again his eyesight
freed from guilt, why will not you, a persecutor and traditor, blinded by false baptism be
baptized by those whom you persecute?"</p>
<p>48. Augustin answered: You do not prove that I, whom you wish to baptize afresh, am
either a persecutor or a traditor. And if you prove this charge against any one, yet the persecutor
and traditor is not to be baptized afresh, if he had been baptized already with the
baptism of Christ. For the reason why it was necessary that Paul should be baptized was
that he had never been washed in any baptism of the kind. Therefore what you have chosen
to insert about Paul has no point of resemblance with the case which you are arguing with
us. But if you had not inserted this, you would have found no place for your childish declamation,
"See how blindness comes in punishment of madness, not to be again expelled
except by baptism!" For with how much more force might one exclaim against you, See
how blindness comes in punishment of madness, which, finding its similitude in Simon,
not in Paul, is not expelled from you even when you have received baptism? For if persecutors
ought to be baptized by those whom they persecute, then let Primianus be baptized by the
followers of Maximianus, whom he persecuted with the utmost eagerness.</p>

<p>49. Petilianus said: "It may be urged that Christ said to His apostles, as
you are constantly quoting against us, ‘He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet,
but is clean every whit.’ Now if you discuss those words in all their fullness, you are bound
by what immediately follows. For this is what He said, in His very words: ‘He that is washed
needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. But
this he said on account of Judas, who should betray Him; therefore said He, Ye are not all
clean.’2041 Whosoever, therefore, has incurred the guilt of treason, has forfeited, like you,
his baptism. Again, after that the betrayer of Christ had himself been condemned, He thus
more fully confirmed His words to the eleven apostles: ‘Now are ye clean through the word
which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you.’2042 And again He said to these
same eleven, ‘Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.’2043 Seeing, then, that these
things were said to the eleven apostles, when the traitor, as we have seen, had been condemned,
you likewise, being traditors, are similarly without both peace and baptism."</p>
<p>50. Augustin answered: If therefore every traditor has forfeited his baptism, it will follow
that every one who, having been baptized by you, has afterwards become a traditor, ought
to be baptized afresh. And if you do not do this, you yourselves sufficiently prove the
falseness of the saying, "Whosoever therefore has incurred the guilt of treason, has forfeited,
like you, his baptism." For if he has forfeited it, let him return and receive it again; but if he
returns and does not receive it, it is clear that he had not forfeited it. Again, if the reason
why it was said to the apostles, "Now are ye clean," and "My peace I give unto you," was that
the traitor had already left the room, then was not that supper of so great a sacrament clean
and able to give peace, which He distributed to all before his going out? And if you venture
to say this with your eyes closed against the truth, what can we do save exclaim the more,
See how blindness comes in punishment of the madness of those who wish to be, as the
apostle says, "teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they
affirm?"2044 And yet, unless blindness came in the way of their pertinacity, it was not a very
difficult matter that you should understand and see that the Lord did not say in the presence
of Judas, Ye are not yet clean, but "Now are ye clean." He added, however, "But not all,"
because there was one there who was not clean; yet if he had been polluting the others by
his presence, it would not have been declared to them, "Now are ye clean," but, as I said before,
Ye are not yet clean. But, after Judas had gone out, He said to them, "Now are ye clean,"
and did not add the words, But not all, because he had now departed in whose presence indeed,
as had been said to them, they were already clean, but not all, because there was one

there unclean. Wherefore in these words the Lord rather declared that in the one company
of men receiving the same sacraments, the uncleanness of some members cannot hurt the
clean. Certainly, if you think that there are among us men like Judas, you might apply to
us the words, "Ye are clean, but not all." But this is not what you say; but you say that because
of the presence of some who are unclean, therefore we are all unclean. This the Lord did
not say to the disciples in the presence of Judas, and therefore whoever says this has not
learned from the good Master what He says.</p>

<p>51. Petilianus said: "But if you say that we give baptism twice over, truly
it is rather you who do this, who slay men who have been baptized; and this we do not say
because you baptize them, but because you cause each one of them, by the act of slaying
him, to be baptized in his own blood. For the baptism of water or of the Spirit is as it were
doubled when the blood of the martyr is wrung from him. And so our Saviour also Himself,
after being baptized in the first instance by John, declared that He must be baptized again,
not this time with water nor with the Spirit, but with the baptism of blood, the cross of suffering,
as it is written, ‘Two disciples, the sons of Zebedee, came unto Him, saying, Lord,
when thou comest into thy kingdom grant that we may sit, one on Thy right hand, and the
other on Thy left hand. But Jesus said unto them, Ye ask a difficult thing: can ye drink of
the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They said
unto Him, We are able. And He said unto them, Ye can indeed drink of the cup that I drink
of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized,’2045 and so forth.
If these are two baptisms, you commend us by your malice, we must needs confess. For
when you kill our bodies, then we do celebrate a second baptism; but it is that we are baptized
with our baptism and with blood, like Christ. Blush, blush, ye persecutors. Ye make martyrs
like unto Christ, who are sprinkled with the baptism of blood after the water of the genuine
baptism."</p>
<p>52. Augustin answered: In the first place, we reply without delay that we do not kill
you, but you kill yourselves by a true death, when you cut yourselves off from the living root
of unity. In the next place, if all who are killed are baptized in their own blood, then all
robbers, all unrighteous, impious, accursed men, who are put to death by the sentence of
the law, are to be considered martyrs, because they are baptized in their own blood. But if
only those are baptized in their own blood who are put to death for righteousness’ sake,
since theirs is the kingdom of heaven,2046 you have already seen that the first question is
why you suffer, and only afterwards should we ask what you suffer. Why therefore do you
puff out your cheeks before you have shown the righteousness of your deeds? Why, does
your tongue resound before your character is approved? If you have made a schism, you
are impious; if you are impious, you die as one guilty of sacrilege, when you are punished
for impiety; if you die as one guilty of sacrilege, how are you baptized in your blood? Or
do you say, I have not made a schism? Let us then inquire into this. Why do you make an
outcry before you prove your case?</p>
<p>53. Or do you say, Even if I am guilty of sacrilege, I ought not to be slain by you? It is
one question as to the enormity of my action, which you never prove with any truth, another
as to the baptism of your blood, from whence you derive your boast. For I never killed you,
<note type="footnote">2045 Mark x. 35-39.</note>
<note type="footnote">2046 Matt. v. 10.</note>

<pb n="1049"/>
nor do you prove that you are killed by any one. Nor even if you were to prove it would it
in any way affect me, whoever it was that killed you, whether he did it justly in virtue of
power lawfully given by the Lord, or committed the crime of murder, like the chaff of the
Lord’s harvest, through some evil desire; just as you are in no way concerned with him who
in recent times, with an intolerable tyranny, attended even by a company of soldiers, not
because he feared any one, but that he might be feared by all, oppressed widows, destroyed
pupils, betrayed the patrimonies of other men, annulled the marriages of other men, contrived
the sale of the property of the innocent, divided the price of the property when sold with its
mourning owners. I should seem to be saying all this out of the invention of my own head,
if it were not sufficiently obvious of whom I speak without the mention of his name.2047
And if all this is undoubtedly true, then just as you are not concerned with this, so neither
are we concerned with anything you say, even though it were true. But if that colleague of
yours, being really a just and innocent man, is maligned by a lying tale, then should we also
learn in no way to give credit to reports, which have been spread abroad of innocent men,
as though they had delivered up the sacred books, or murdered any of their fellow-men.
To this we may add, that I refer to a man who lived with you, whose birthday you were wont
to celebrate with such large assemblies, with whom you joined in the kiss of peace in the
sacraments, in whose hands you placed the Eucharist, to whom in turn you extended your
hands to receive it from his ministering, whose ears, when they were deaf amid the groanings
of all Africa, you durst not offend by free speech; for paying to whom, even indirectly, a
most witty compliment, by saying that in the Count 2048 he had a god for his companion,
some one of your party was extolled to the skies. But you reproach us with the deeds of
men with whom we never lived, whose faces we never saw, in whose lifetime we were either
boys, or perhaps as yet not even born. What is the meaning, then, of your great unfairness
and perversity, that you should wish to impose on us the burdens of those whom we never
knew, whilst you will not bear the burdens of your friends? The divine Scriptures exclaim:
"When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him."2049 If he whom you saw did
not pollute you, why do you reproach me with one whom I could not have seen? Or do you
say, I did not consent with him, because his deeds were displeasing to me? But, at any rate,
you went up to the altar of God with him. Come now, if you would defend yourself, make
a distinction between your two positions, and say that it is one thing to consent together
for sin, as the two elders consented together when they laid a plot against the chastity of

Susannah, and another thing to receive the sacrament of the Lord in company with a thief,
as the apostles received even that first supper in company with Judas. I am all in favor of
your defense. But why do you not consider how much more easily, in the course of your
defense, you have acquitted all the nations and boundaries of the earth, throughout which
the inheritance of Christ is dispersed? For if it was possible for you to see a thief, and to
share the sacraments with the thief whom you saw, and yet not to share his sin, how much
less was it possible for the remotest nations of the earth to have anything in common with
the sins of African traditors and persecutors, supposing your charges and assertions to be
true, even though they held the sacraments in common with them? Or do you say, I saw
in him the bishop, I did not see in him the thief? Say what you will. I allow this defense
also, and in this the world is acquitted of the charges which you brought against it. For if
it was permitted you to ignore the character of a man whom you knew, why is the whole
world not allowed to be ignorant of those it never knew, unless, indeed, the Donatists are
allowed to be ignorant of what they do not wish to know, while the nations of the earth may
not be ignorant of what they cannot know?</p>
<p>54. Or do you say, Theft is one thing, delivery of the sacred books or persecution is
another? I grant there is a difference, nor is it worth while now to show wherein that difference
consists. But listen to the summary of the argument. If he could not make you a thief,
because his thieving was displeasing in your sight, who can make men traditors or murderers
to whom such treachery or murder is abhorrent? First, then, confess that you share in all
the evil of Optatus, whom you knew, and even so reproach me with any evil which was
found in those whom I knew not. And do not say to me, But my charges are serious, yours
but trifling. You must first acknowledge them, however trifling they may be in your case,
not before I on my side confess the charges against me, but before I can allow you to say
these serious things about me at all. Did Optatus, whom you knew make you a thief by being
your colleague, or not? Answer me one or the other. If you say he did not, I ask why he did
not,—because he was not a thief himself? or because you do not know it? or because you
disapprove of it? If you say, Because he himself was not a thief, much more ought we not
to believe that those with whom you reproach us were of such a character as you assert. For
if we must not believe of Optatus what both Christians and pagans and Jews, ay, and what
both our party and yours assert, how much less should we believe what you assert of any
one? But if you say, Because you do not know it, all the nations of the earth answer you,
Much more do we not know of all that you reproach us with in these men. But if you say,
Because you disapproved of it, they answer you with the same voice, Although you have
never proved the truth of what you say, yet acts like these are viewed by us with disapproval.
But if you say, Lo, Optatus, whom I knew, made me a thief because he was my colleague,
and I was in the habit of going to the altar with him when he committed those deeds; but I
do not greatly heed it, because the fault was trivial, but your party made you a traditor and

<pb n="1051"/>
a murderer,—I answer that I do not allow that I too am made a traditor and a murderer by
the sins of other men, just because you confess that you are made a thief by the sin of another
man; for it must be remembered that you are proved a thief, not by our judgment, but by
your own confession. For we say that every man must bear his own burden, as the apostle
is our witness.2050 But you, of your own accord, have taken the burden of Optatus on your
own shoulders, not because you committed the theft, or consented to it, but because you
declared your conviction that what another did applied to you. For, as the apostle says,
when speaking of food, "I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing
unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean;"2051
by the same rule, it may be said that the sins of others cannot implicate those who disapprove
of them; but if any one thinks that they affect him, then he is affected by them. Wherefore
you do not convict us of being traditors or murderers, even though you were to prove
something of the sort against those who share the sacraments with us; but the guilt of theft
is fastened on you, even if you disapprove of everything that Optatus did, not in virtue of
our accusation, but by your own decision. And that you may not think this a trivial fault,
read what the apostle says, "Nor shall thieves inherit the kingdom of God."2052 But those
who shall not inherit the kingdom of God will certainly not be on His right hand among
those whom it shall be said, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation of the world." If they are not there, where will they be except
on the left hand? Therefore among those to whom it shall be said, "Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."2053 In vain, therefore,
do you indulge in your security, thinking it a trivial fault which separates you from the
kingdom of God, and sends you into everlasting fire. How much better will you do to betake
yourself to true confusion, saying, Every one of us shall bear his own burden, and the winnowing
fan at the last day shall separate the chaff from the wheat!</p>
<p>55. But it is evident that you are afraid of its being forthwith said to you, "Why then,
whilst you attempt to place on some men’s backs the burdens of their neighbors, have you
dared to separate yourselves from the Lord’s corn, dispersed throughout the world, before
the winnowing at the last day?" Accordingly, you who disapprove of the deeds of your party,
whilst you are taking precautions against being charged with the schism which you all have
made, are involving yourselves also in their sins which you did not commit; and while the
shrewd Petilianus is afraid of my being able to say that am I not such as he thinks Cæcilianus
was, he is obliged to confess that he himself is such as he knows Optatus to have been. Or

are you not such as the common voice of Africa proclaims him to have been? Then neither
are we such as those with whom you reproach us are either suspected to have been by your
mistake, or calumniously asserted to have been by your madness, or proved to have been
by the truth. Much less is the wheat of the Lord in all the nations of the earth of such a
character, seeing that it never heard the names of those of whom you speak. There is
therefore no reason why you should perish in such sin of separation and such sacrilege of
schism. And yet, if you are made to suffer for this great impiety by the judgment of God,
you say that you are even baptized in your blood; so that you are not content with feeling
no remorse for your division, but you must even glory in your punishment.</p>

man baptizes with a false baptism, then none of those have true baptism who are baptized
by men in your party, that are, I do not say openly, but even secretly guilty. For if he who
gives baptism gives something that is God’s, if he is already guilty in the sight of God, how
can he be giving something that is God’s if a guilty man cannot give true baptism? But in
reality you wait till he is guilty in your sight as well, as though what he proposes to confer
were something that belonged to you.</p>

<p>60. Petilianus said: "For if you mix what is false with what is true, falsehood
often imitates the truth by treading in its steps. Just in the same way a picture imitates the
true man of nature, depicting with its colors the false resemblance of truth. And in the same
way, too, the brilliancy of a mirror catches the countenance, so as to represent the eyes of
him who gazes on it. In this way it presents to each comer his own countenance, so that
the very features of the comer meet themselves in turn; and of such virtue is the falsehood
of a clear mirror, that the very eyes which see themselves recognize themselves as though
in some one else. And even when a shadow stands before it, it doubles the reflection, dividing
its unity in great part through a falsehood. Must we then hold that anything is true, because
a lying representation is given of it? But it is one thing to paint a man, another to give birth
to one. For does any one represent fictitious children to a man who wishes for an heir? or
would any one look for true heirs in the falsehood of a picture? Truly it is a proof of madness
to fall in love with a picture, letting go one’s hold of what is true."</p>
<p>61. Augustin answered: Are you then really not ashamed to call the baptism of Christ
a lie, even when it is found in the most false of men? Far be it from any one to suppose that
the wheat of the Lord, which has been commanded to grow among the tares throughout
the whole field, that is, throughout the whole of this world, until the harvest, that is, until
the end of the world,2056 can have perished in consequence of your evil words. Nay, even
among the very tares themselves, which are commanded not to be gathered, but to be tolerated
even to the end, and among the very chaff, which shall only be separated from the wheat
by the winnowing at the last day,2057 does any one dare to say that any baptism is false which
is given and received in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?
Would you say that those whom you depose from their office, whether as your colleagues
or your fellow-priests, on the testimony of women whom they have seduced (since examples
of this kind are not wanting anywhere), were false or true before their crime was proved
against them? You will certainly answer, False. Why then were they able both to have and
to give true baptism? Why did not their falseness as men corrupt in them the truth of God?
Is it not most truly written, "For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit?"2058 Seeing
then that the Holy Spirit fled from them, how came it that the truth of baptism was in them,
except because what the Holy Spirit fled from was the falseness of man, not the truth of the
sacrament? Further, if even the deceitful have the true baptism, how do they have it who
possess it in truthfulness? Whence you ought to observe that it is rather your conversation
which is colored with childish pigments; and accordingly, he who neglects the living Word
to take pleasure in such coloring is himself loving the picture in the place of the reality.</p>

that those who declare that there are two are mad."</p>
<p>63. Augustin replied: These words of yours are arguments against yourselves; but in
your madness you are not aware of it. For the men who say there are two baptisms are those
who declare their opinion that the just and the unjust have different baptisms; whereas it
belongs neither to one party nor the other, but in both of them is one, being Christ’s, although
they themselves are not one: and yet the baptism, which is one, the just have to salvation,

<p>64. Petilianus said: "But yet, if I may be allowed the comparison, it is
certain that the sun appears double to the insane, although it only be that a dark blue cloud
often meets it, and its discolored surface, being struck by the brightness, while the rays of
the sun are reflected from it, seems to send forth as it were rays of its own. So in the same
way in the faith of baptism, it is one thing to seek for reflections, another to recognize the
truth."</p>
<p>65. Augustin answered: What are you saying, if I may ask? When a dark blue cloud
reflects the rays of the sun with which it is struck, is it only to the insane, and not to all who
look on it, that there appear to be two suns? But when it appears so to the insane as such,
it appears to them alone. But if I may say so without being troublesome, I would have you
take care lest saying such things and talking in such a way should be itself a sign of madness.
I suppose, however, that what you meant to say was this,—that the just had the truth of
baptism, the unjust only its reflection. And if this be so, I venture to say that the reflection
was found in that man of our party,2060 to whom not God, but a certain Count,2061 was
God; but that the truth was either in you or in him who uttered the witty saying against
Optatus, when he said that "in the Count he had a god for his companion."2062 And distinguish
between those who were baptized by either of these, and in the one party approve the
true baptism, in the others exclude the reflection, and introduce the truth.</p>

<p>66. Petilianus said: "But to pass rapidly through these minor points: can
he be said to lay down the law who is not a magistrate of the court? or is what he lays down
to be considered law, when in the character of a private person he disturbs public rights?
Is it not rather the case that he not only involves himself in guilt, but is held to be a forger,
and that which he composes a forgery?"</p>
<p>67. Augustin answered: What if your private person, whom you deem a forger, were
to set forth to any one the law of the emperor? Would not the man, when he had compared
it with the law of those who have the genuine law, and found it to be identically the same,
lay aside all care about the source from which he had obtained it, and consider only what
he had obtained? For what the forger gives is false when he gives it of his own falseness; but
when something true is given by any person, even though he be a forger, yet, although the
giver be not truthful, the gift is notwithstanding true.</p>

<p>68. Petilianus said: "Or if any one chance to recollect the chants of a
priest, is he therefore to be deemed a priest, because with sacrilegious mouth he publishes
the strain of a priest?"</p>
<p>69. Augustin answered: In this question you are speaking just as though we were at
present inquiring what constituted a true priest, not what constituted true baptism. For
that a man should be a true priest, it is requisite that he should be clothed not with the sacrament
alone, but with righteousness, as it is written, "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness."
2063 But if a man be a priest in virtue of the sacrament alone, as was the high
priest Caiaphas, the persecutor of the one most true Priest, then even though he himself be
not truthful, yet what he gives is true, if he gives not what is his own but what is God’s; as
it is said of Caiaphas himself, "This spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year,
he prophesied."2064 And yet, to use the same simile which you employed yourself: if you
were to hear even from any one that was profane the prayer of the priest couched in the
words suitable to the mysteries of the gospel, can you possibly say to him, Your prayer is
not true, though he himself may be not only no true priest, but not a priest at all? seeing
that the Apostle Paul said that certain testimony of I know not what Cretan prophet was
true, though he was not reckoned among the prophets of God for he says, "One of themselves,
even a prophet of their own, said the Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies: this
witness is true."2065 If, therefore, the apostle even himself bore witness to the testimony of
some obscure prophet of a foreign race, because he found it to be true, why do not we, when
we find in any one what belongs to Christ, and is true even though the man with whom it
may be found be deceitful and perverse, why do not we in such a case make a distinction
between the fault which is found in the man, and the truth which he has not of his own but
of God’s? and why do we not say, This sacrament is true, as Paul said, "This witness is true"?
Does it at all follow that we say, The man himself also is truthful, because we say, This sacrament
is true? Just as I would ask whether the apostle counted that prophet among the
prophets of the Lord, because he confirmed the truth of what he found to be true in him.
Likewise the same apostle, when he was at Athens, perceived a certain altar among the altars
of the false gods, on which was this inscription, "To the unknown God." And this testimony
he made use of to build them up in Christ, to the extent of quoting the inscription in his
sermon, and adding, "Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you."
Did he, because he found that altar among the altars of idols, or set up by sacrilegious hands,
therefore condemn or reject what he found in it that was true? or did he, because of the
truth which he found upon it, therefore persuade them that they ought also to follow the
<note type="footnote">2063 Ps. cxxxii. 9.</note>

<note type="footnote">2065 Tit. i. 12, 13.</note>

<pb n="1060"/>
sacrilegious practices of the pagans? Surely he did neither of the two; but presently, when,
as he judged fitting, he wished to introduce to their knowledge the Lord Himself unknown
to them, but known to him, he says among other things, that "He is not far from every one
of us: for in Him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets
have said."2066 Can it be said that here also, because he found among the sacrilegious, the
evidence of truth, he either approved their wickedness because of the evidence, or condemned
the evidence because of their wickedness? But it is unavoidable that you should be always
in the wrong, so long as you do despite to the sacraments of God because of the faults of
men, or think that we take upon ourselves the sacrilege even of your schism, for the sake of
the sacraments of God, to which we are unwilling to do despite in you.</p>

<p>72. Petilianus said: "For although there is only one baptism, yet it is
consecrated in three several grades. John gave water without the name of the Trinity, as he
declared himself, saying, ‘I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but He that
cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize
you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.’2070 Christ gave the Holy Spirit, as it is written, ‘He
breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost,’2071 And the Comforter
Himself came on the apostles as a fire burning with rustling flames. O true divinity, which
seemed to blaze, not to burn! as it is written, ‘And suddenly there came a sound from
heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where the apostles were sitting.
And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the
Spirit gave them utterance.’2072 But you, O persecutor, have not even the water of repentance,
seeing that you hold the power not of the murdered John, but of the murderer Herod. You
therefore, O traditor, have not the Holy Spirit of Christ; for Christ did not betray others to
death, but was Himself betrayed. For you, therefore, the fire in the spirit in Hades is full of
life,—that fire which, surging with hungry tongues of flame, will be able to burn your limbs
to all eternity without consuming them, as it is written of the punishment of the guilty in
hell, ‘Neither shall their fire be quenched.’"2073</p>
<p>73. Augustin answered: You are the calumnious slanderer, not the truthful arguer.
Will you not at length cease to make assertions of a kind which, if you do not prove them,
can apply to nobody; and even if you prove them, certainly cannot apply to the unity of the
whole world, which is in the saints as in the wheat of God? If we too were pleased to return
calumnies for calumnies, we too might possibly be able to give vent to eloquent slanderers.
We too might use the expression, "With rustling flames;" but to me an expression never
sounds in any way eloquent which is inappropriate in its use. We too might say, "Surging
with hungry tongues of flame;" but we do not wish that the tongues of flame in our writings,
when they are read by any one in his senses, should be judged hungry for want of the sap
of weightiness, or that the reader himself, while he finds in them no food of useful sentiments,
should be left to suffer from the hunger of excessive emptiness. See, I declare that your
Circumcelliones are burning, not with rustling but with headlong flames. If you answer,
What is that to us? why do not you, when you reproach with any one whom you will, not
listen in turn to our answer, We too know nothing of it? If you answer, You do not prove
the fact, why may not the whole world answer you in turn, Neither do you prove it? Let us

agree, therefore, if you please, that you should not charge us with the guilt of the wicked
men whom you consider to belong to us, and that we should abstain from similar charges
against you. So you will see, by this just agreement, confirmed and ratified, that you have
no charge which you can bring against the seed of Abraham, as found in all the nations of
the earth. But I find without difficulty a grievous charge to bring against you: Why have
you impiously separated yourselves from the seed of Abraham, which is in all nations of the
earth? Against this charge you certainly have no means whereby you may defend yourselves.
For we each of us clear ourselves of the sins of other men; but this, that you do not hold
communion with all the nations of the earth, which are blessed in the seed of Abraham, is
a very grievous crime, of which not some but all of you are guilty.</p>
<p>74. And yet you know, as you prove by your quotation, that the Holy Spirit descended
in such wise, that those who were then filled with it spake with divers tongues: what was
the meaning of that sign and prodigy? Why then is the Holy Spirit given now in such wise,
that no one to whom it is given speaks with divers tongues, except because that miracle then
prefigured that all nations of the earth should believe, and that thus the gospel should be
found to be in every tongue? Just as it was foretold in the psalm so long before: "There is
no speech nor language where their voice is not heard." This was said with reference to
those men who were destined, after receiving the Holy Spirit, to speak with every kind of
tongue. But because this passage itself signified that the gospel should be found hereafter
in all nations and languages, and that the body of Christ should sound forth throughout all
the world in every tongue, therefore he goes on to say, "Their sound is gone out throughout
all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world." Hence it is that the true Church is
hidden from no one. And hence comes that which the Lord Himself says in the gospel, "A
city that is set on a hill cannot be hid."2074 And therefore David continues in the same
psalm, "In the sun hath He placed His tabernacle," that is, in the open light of day; as we
read in the Book of Kings, "For thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel,
and before the sun."2075 And He Himself is "as a bridegroom coming out of His chamber,
and rejoiceth as a giant to run His race. His going forth is from the end of heaven:" here
you have the coming of the Lord in the flesh. "And His circuit unto the ends of it:" here
you have His resurrection and ascension. "And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof:"
2076 here you have the coming of the Holy Spirit, whom He sent in tongues of fire, that
He might make manifest the glowing heat of charity, which he certainly cannot have who
does not keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace with the Church, which is
throughout all languages.</p>

<pb n="1064"/>
<p>75. Next, however, with regard to your statement that there is indeed one baptism,2077
but that it is consecrated in three several grades, and to your having distributed the three
forms of it to three persons after such fashion, that you ascribe the water to John, the Holy
Spirit to the Lord Jesus Christ, and, in the third place, the fire to the Comforter sent down
from above,—consider for a moment in how great an error you are involved. For you were
brought to entertain such an opinion simply from the words of John: "I indeed baptize you
with water: but He that cometh after me is mightier than I: He shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost, and with fire."2078 Nor were you willing to take into consideration that the
three things are not attributed to three persons taken one by one,—water to John, the Holy
Spirit to Christ, fire to the Comforter,—but that the three should rather be referred to two
persons—one of them to John, the other two to our Lord. For neither is it said, I indeed
baptize you with water: but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am
not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost: and the Comforter, who is
to come after Him, He shall baptize you with fire; but "I indeed," He says, "with water: but
He that cometh after me with the Holy Ghost, and with fire." One he attributes to himself,
two to Him that cometh after him. You see, therefore, how you have been deceived in the
number. Listen further. You said that there was one baptism consecrated in three
stages—water, the Holy Spirit, and fire; and you assigned three persons to the three stages
severally—John to the water, Christ to the Spirit, the Comforter to the fire. If, therefore,
the water of John bears reference to the same baptism which is commended as being one,
it was not right that those should have been baptized a second time by the command of the
Apostle Paul whom he found to have been baptized by John. For they already had water,
belonging, as you say, to the same baptism; so that it remained that they should receive the
Holy Spirit and fire, because these were wanting in the baptism of John, that their baptism
might be completed, being consecrated, as you assert, in three stages. But since they were
ordered to be baptized by the authority of an apostle, it is sufficiently made manifest that
that water with which John baptized had no reference to the baptism of Christ, but belonged
to another dispensation suited to the exigencies of the times.</p>
<p>76. Lastly, when you wished to prove that the Holy Spirit was given by Christ, and had
brought forward as a proof from the gospel, that Jesus on rising from the dead breathed
into the face of His disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost;"2079 and when you wished
to prove that that last fire which was named in connection with baptism was found in the

rustling flames," as though there were one Holy Spirit whom He gave by breathing on the
face of His disciples, and another who, after His ascension, came on the apostles? Are we
to suppose, therefore, that there are two Holy Spirits? Who will be found so utterly mad as
to assert this? Christ therefore Himself gave the same Holy Spirit, whether by breathing on
the face of the disciples, or by sending Him down from heaven on the day of Pentecost, with
undoubted commendation of His holy sacrament. Accordingly it was not that Christ gave
the Holy Spirit, and the Comforter gave the fire, that the saying might be fulfilled, "With
the Holy Spirit, and with fire;" but the same Christ Himself gave the Holy Spirit in both
cases, making it manifest while He was yet on earth by His breathing, and when He was
ascended into heaven by the tongues of flame. For that you may know that the words of
John, "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost," were not fulfilled at the time when He
breathed on His disciples face, so that they should require to be baptized, when the Comforter
should come, not with the Spirit any longer, but with fire, I would have you remember
the most outspoken words of Scripture, and see what the Lord Himself said to them when
He ascended into heaven: "John truly baptized you with water; but ye shall be baptized with
the Holy Ghost, whom ye shall receive not many days hence at Pentecost."2080 What could
be plainer than this testimony? But according to your interpretation, what He should have
said was this: John verily baptized you with water; but ye were baptized with the Holy
Spirit when I breathed on your faces; and next in due order shall ye be baptized with fire,
which ye shall receive not many days hence;—in order that by this means the three stages
should be completed, in which you say that the one baptism was consecrated. And so it
proves to be the case that you are still ignorant of the meaning of the words, "He shall baptize
you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire;" and you are rash enough to be williing to teach
what you do not know yourselves.</p>

<p>77. Petilianus said: "But that I may thoroughly investigate the baptism
in the name of the Trinity, the Lord Christ said to His apostles: ‘Go ye, and baptize the nations,
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to
observe all things whatsoever I command you.’2081 Whom do you teach, traditor? Him
whom you condemn? Whom do you teach, traditor? Him whom you slay? Once more,
whom do you teach? Him whom you have made a murderer? How then do you baptize in
the name of the Trinity? You cannot call God your Father. For when the Lord Christ said,
‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God,’2082 you who have
not peace of soul cannot have God for your Father. Or how, again, can you baptize in the
name of the Son, who betray that Son Himself, who do not imitate the Son of God in any
of His sufferings or crosses? Or how, again, can you baptize in the name of the Holy Ghost,
when the Holy Ghost came only on those apostles who were not guilty of treason? Seeing,
therefore, that God is not your Father, neither are you truly born again with the water of
baptism. No one of you is born perfectly. You in your impiety have neither father nor
mother. Seeing, then, that you are of such a kind, ought I not to baptize you, even though
you wash yourselves a thousand times, after the similitude of the Jews, who as it were baptize
the flesh?"</p>
<p>78. Augustin answered: certainly you had proposed thoroughly to investigate the
baptism in the name of the Trinity, and you had set us to listen with much attention; but
following, as it would seem, what is the easiest course to you, how soon have you returned
to your customary abuse! This you carry out with genuine fluency. For you set before
yourself what victims you please, against whom to inveigh with whatsoever bitterness you
please: in the midst of which last latitude of discourse you are driven into the greatest straits
if any one does but use the little word, Prove it. For this is what is said to you by the seed
of Abraham; and since in him all nations of the earth are blessed, they care but little when
they are cursed by you. But yet, since you are treating of baptism, which you consider to
be true when it is found in a just man, but false when it is found in the unjust, see how I too,
if I were to investigate baptism in the name of the Trinity, according to your rule, might
say, with great fullness, as it seems to me, that he has not God for his father who in a Count
has God for his companion,2083 nor believes that any is his Christ, save him for whose sake
he has endured suffering; and that he has not the Holy Ghost who burned the wretched
Africa in so very different a fashion with tongues of fire. How then can they have baptism,
or how can they administer it in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost? Surely you must now perceive that baptism can exist in an unrighteous man, and

<pb n="1067"/>
be administered by an unrighteous man, and that no unrighteous baptism, but such as is
just and true,—not because it belongs to the unrighteous man, but because it is of God.
And herein I am uttering no calumny against you, as you never cease to do, on some pretense
or other, against the whole world; and, what is even more intolerable, you do not even bring
any proof about the very points on which you found your calumnies. But I know not how
this can possibly be endured, because you not only bring calumnies against holy men about
unrighteous men, but you even bring a charge against the holy baptism itself, which must
needs be holy in any man, however unrighteous he may be, from a comparison with the
infection arising from the sins of wicked men, so that you say that baptism partakes of the
character of him by whom it is possessed, or administered, or received. Furthermore, if a
man partakes of the character of him in whose company he approaches sacred mysteries,
and if the sacraments themselves partake of the character of the men in whom they are, holy
men may well be satisfied to find consolation in the thought that they only fare like holy
baptism itself in hearing false accusations from your lips. But it would be well for you to
see how you are condemned out of your own mouths, if both the sober among you are
counted as drunken from the infection of the drunken in your ranks, and the merciful among
you become robbers from the infection of the robbers, and whatever evil is found among
you in the persons of wicked men is perforce shared by those who are not wicked; and if
baptism itself is unclean in all of you who are unclean, and if it is of different kinds according
to the varying character of uncleanness itself, as it must be if it is perforce of the same
character as the man by whom it is possessed or administered. These suppositions most
undoubtedly are false, and accordingly they in no wise injure us, when you bring them forward
against us without looking back upon yourselves. But they do injure you, because,
when you bring them forward falsely, they do not fall on us; but since you imagine them to
be true, they recoil upon yourselves.</p>

<p>79. Petilianus said: "For if the apostles were allowed to baptize those
whom John had washed with the baptism of repentance, shall it not likewise be allowed to
me to baptize men guilty of sacrilege like yourselves?"</p>
<p>80. Augustin answered: Where then is what you said above, that there was not one
baptism of John and another of Christ, but that there was one baptism, consecrated in three
stages, of which three stages John gave the water, Christ the Spirit, and the Comforter the
fire? Why then did the apostles repeat the water in the case of those to whom John had
already administered water belonging to the one baptism which is consecrated in three
stages? Surely you must see how necessary it is that every one should understand the

<p>81. Petilianus said: "Nor indeed will it be possible that the Holy Spirit
should be implanted in the heart of any one by the laying on of the hands of the priest, unless
the water of a pure conscience has gone before to give him birth."</p>
<p>82. Augustin answered: In these few words of yours two errors are involved; and one
of them, indeed, has no great bearing on the question which is being discussed between us,
but yet it helps to convict you of want of skill. For the Holy Spirit came upon a hundred
and twenty men, without the laying on of any person’s hands, and again upon Cornelius
the centurion and those who were with him, even before they were baptized. 2084 But the
second error in these words of yours entirely overthrows your whole case. For you say that
the water of a pure conscience must necessarily precede to give new birth, before the Holy
Spirit can follow on it. Accordingly, either all the water consecrated in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is water of a pure conscience, not for the
merits of those by whom it is administered, or by whom it is received, but in virtue of the
stainless merits of Him who instituted this baptism; or else if only a pure conscience on the
part both of the ministrant and the recipient can produce the water of a pure conscience,
what do you make of those whom you find to have been baptized by men who bore a conscience
stained with as yet undiscovered guilt, especially if there exist among the said baptized
persons any one that should confess that he at the time when he was baptized had a bad
conscience, in that he might possbily have desired to use that opportunity for the accomplishment
of some sinful act? When, therefore, it shall be made clear to you that neither
the man who administered baptism, nor the man who received it, had a pure conscience,
will you give your judgment that he ought to be baptized afresh? You will assuredly neither
say nor do anything of the sort. The purity therefore of baptism is entirely unconnected
with the purity or impurity of the conscience either of the giver or the recipient. Will you
therefore dare to say that the deceiver, or the robber, or the oppressor of the fatherless and
widows, or the sunderer of marriages, or the betrayer, the seller, the divider of the patrimony
of other men,2085 was a man of pure conscience? Or will you further dare to say that those
were men of pure conscience, whom it is hard to imagine wanting in such times, men who
made interest with the man I have described, that they might be baptized, not for the sake
of Christ, nor for the sake of eternal life, but to conciliate earthly friendships, and to satisfy
earthly desires? Further, if you do not venture to say that these were men of pure conscience,
then if you find any of their number who have been baptized, give to them the water of a
pure conscience, which they as yet have not received; and if you will not do this, then leave
off casting in our teeth a matter which you do not understand, lest you should be forced to
answer in reply to us about a matter which you know full well.</p>

<p>83. Petilianus said: "Which Holy Spirit certainly cannot come on you,
who have not been washed even with the baptism of repentance; but the water of the traditor,
which most truly needs to be repented of, does but work pollution."</p>
<p>84. Augustin answered: As a matter of fact, not only do you not prove us to be traditors,
but neither did your fathers prove that our fathers were guilty of that sin; though, even if
that had been proved, the consequence would have been that they would not be our fathers,
according to your earlier assertion, seeing that we had not followed their deeds: yet neither
should we on their account be severed from the companionship of unity, and from the seed
of Abraham, in which all nations of the earth are blessed.2086 However, if the water of Christ
be one thing, and the water of the traditor another, because Christ was not a traditor, why
should not the water of Christ be one thing, and the water of a robber another, since certainly
Christ was not a robber? Do you therefore baptize again after baptism by your robber, and
I will baptize again after the traditor, who is neither mine nor yours; or, if one must believe
the documents which are produced, who is both mine and yours; or, if we are to believe the
communion of the whole world rather than the party of Donatus, who is not mine, but
yours. But, by a better and a sounder judgment, because it is according to the words of the
apostle, every one of us shall bear his own burden;2087 nor is either that robber yours, if you
are not yourselves robbers; nor does any traditor belong to any one either of us or you, who
is not himself a traditor. And yet we are Catholics, who, following the spirit of that judgment,
do not desert the unity of the Church; but you are heretics, who, on account of charges,
whether true or false, which you have brought against certain men, are unwilling to maintain
Christian charity with the seed of Abraham.</p>

<p>85. Petilianus said: "But that the truth of this may be made manifest from
the apostles, we are taught by their actions, as it is written: ‘It came to pass that while
Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus;
and finding certain disciples, he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any
Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said,
Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance,
saying unto the people, that they should believe on Him which should come after him, that
is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they
spake with tongues, and prophesied. And all the men were about twelve.’2088 If, therefore,
they were baptized that they might receive the Holy Ghost, why do not you, if you wish to
receive the Holy Ghost, take measures to obtain a true renewing, after your falsehoods?
And if we do ill in urging this, why do you seek after us? or at any rate, if it is an offense,
condemn Paul in the first instance; the Paul who certainly washed off what had already existed,
whereas we in you give baptism which as yet does not exist. For you do not, as we
have often said before, wash with a true baptism; but you bring on men an ill repute by your
empty name of a false baptism."</p>
<p>86. Augustin answered: "We bring no accusation against Paul, who gave to men the
baptism of Christ because they had not the baptism of Christ, but the baptism of John, according
to their own reply; for, being asked, Unto what were ye baptized? they answered,
Unto John’s baptism; which has nothing to do with the baptism of Christ, and is neither a
part of it nor a step towards it. Otherwise, either at that time the water of the baptism of
Christ was renewed a second time, or if the baptism of Christ was then made perfect by the
two waters, the baptism is less perfect which is given now, because it is not given with the
water which was given at the hands of John. But either one of these opinions it is impious
and sacrilegious to entertain. Therefore Paul gave the baptism of Christ to those who had
not the baptism of Christ, but only the baptism of John.</p>
<p>87. But why the baptism of John, which is not necessary now, was necessary at that
time, I have explained elsewhere; and the question has no bearing on the point at issue
between us at the present time, except so far as that it may appear that the baptism of John
was one thing, the baptism of Christ another,—just as that baptism was a different thing
with which the apostle says that our fathers were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, when
they passed through the Red Sea under the guidance of Moses.2089 For the law and the
prophets up to the time of John the Baptist had sacraments which foreshadowed things to
<note type="footnote">2088 Acts xix. 1-7.</note>
<note type="footnote">2089 1 Cor. x. 1, 2.</note>

<pb n="1072"/>
come; but the sacraments of our time bear testimony that that has come already which the
former sacraments foretold should come. John therefore was a foreteller of Christ nearer
to Him in time than all who went before him. And because all the righteous men and
prophets of former times desired to see the fulfillment of what, through the revelation of
the Spirit, they foresaw would come to pass,—whence also the Lord Himself says, "That
many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard
them,"2090—therefore it was said of John that he was more than a prophet, and that among
all that were born of women there was none greater than he;2091 because to the righteous
men who went before him it was only granted to foretell the coming of Christ, but to John
it was given both to foretell Him in His absence and to behold His presence, so that it should
be found that to him was made manifest what the others had desired. And therefore the
sacrament of his baptism is still connected with the foretelling of Christ’s coming, though
as of something very soon to be fulfilled, seeing that up to his time there were still foretellings
of the first coming of our Lord, of which coming we have now announcements, but no
longer predictions. But the Lord, teaching the way of humility, condescended to make use
of the sacraments which He found here in reference to the foretelling of His coming, not in
order to assist the operation of His cleansing, but as an example for our piety, that so He
might show to us with what reverence we ought to receive those sacraments which bear
witness that He is already come, when He did not disdain to make use of those which foreshadowed
His coming in the future. And John, therefore, though the nearest to Christ in
point of time, and within one year of the same age with Him, yet, while he was baptizing,
went before the way of Christ who was still to come; for which reason it was said of him,
"Behold, I send my messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee."2092
And he himself preached, saying, "There cometh one mightier than I after me."2093 In like
manner, therefore, the circumcision on the eighth day, which was given to the patriarchs,
foretold our justification, to the putting away of carnal lusts through the resurrection of our
Lord, which took place after the seventh day, which is the Sabbath-day, on the eighth, that
is, the Lord’s day, which fell on the third day after His burial; yet the infant Christ received
the same circumcision of the flesh, with its prophetic signification. And as the Passover,
which was celebrated by the Jews with the slaying of a lamb, prefigured the passion of our
Lord and His departure from this world to the Father, yet the same Lord celebrated the same
Passover with His disciples, when they reminded Him of it, saying, Where wilt Thou that

<note type="footnote">2093 Mark i. 7.</note>

<pb n="1073"/>
we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover?2094 so too He Himself also received the baptism
of John, which formed a part of the latest foretelling of His coming. But as the Jews’ circumcision
of the flesh is one thing, and the ceremony which we observe on the eighth day after
persons are baptized is another;2095 and the Passover which the Jews still celebrate with the
slaying of a lamb is one thing,2096 and that which we receive in the body and blood of our
Lord is another,—so the baptism of John was one thing, the baptism of Christ is another.
For by the former series of rites the latter were foretold as destined to arrive; by these latter
the others are declared to be fulfilled. And even though Christ received the others, yet are
they not necessary for us, who have received the Lord Himself who was foretold in them.
But when the coming of our Lord was as yet recent, it was necessary for any one who had
received the former that he should be imbued with the latter also; but it was wholly needless
that any one who had been so imbued should be compelled to go back to the former rites.</p>
<p>88. Wherefore do not seek to raise confusion out of the baptism of John, the source
and intention of which was either such as I have here set forth; or if any other better explanation
of it can be given, this much still is clear, that the baptism of John and the baptism of
Christ are two distinct and separate things, and that the former was expressly called the
baptism of John, as is clear both from the answer of those men whose case you quoted, and
from the words of our Lord Himself, when he says, "The baptism of John, whence was it?
from heaven, or of men?"2097 But the latter is never called the baptism of Cæcilianus, or of
Donatus, or of Augustin, or of Petilianus, but the baptism of Christ. For if you think that
we are shameless, because we will not allow that any one should be baptized after baptism
from us, although we see that men were baptized again who had received the baptism of
John, who certainly is incomparably greater than ourselves, will you maintain that John and
Optatus were of equal dignity? The thing appears ridiculous. And yet I fancy that you do
not hold them to be equals, but consider Optatus the greater of the two. For the apostle
baptized after baptism by John: you venture to baptize no one after baptism by Optatus.
Was it because Optatus was in unity with you? I know not with what heart a theory like
<note type="footnote">2094 Matt. xxvi. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">2095 In his treatise on the Sermon on the Mount, Book I. iv. 12, Augustin again compares the "celebratio
octavarum feriarum quas in regeneratione novi hominis celebramus" with the circumcision on the eighth day;
and in Serm. 376, c. ii. 2, he says that the heads of the infants were uncovered on the eighth day, as a token of
liberty. Cp. Bingham, Orig. Sacr. XII. iv. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">2096 Augustin apparently supposed that the sacrifice of the paschal lamb was still observed among the Jews
of the dispersion; cp. Retract. I. x. 2. It was, however, forbidden them to sacrifice the Passover except in the
place which the Lord should choose to place His name there; and hence the Jews, though they observe the other
paschal solemnities, abstain from the sacrifice of the lamb.</note>
<note type="footnote">2097 Matt. xxi. 25.</note>

<pb n="1074"/>
this can be maintained, if the friend of the Count,2098 who had in the Count a god for his
companion, is said to have been in unity, and the friend of the Bridegroom to have been
excluded from it. But if John was preeminently in unity, and far more excellent and greater
than all of us and all of you, and yet the Apostle Paul baptized after him, why do you then
not baptize after Optatus? Unless indeed it be that your blindness brings you into such a
strait that you should say that Optatus had the power of giving the Holy Spirit, and that
John had not! And if you do not say this, for fear of being ridiculed for your madness even
by the insane themselves, what answer will you be able to make when you are asked why
men should have required to be baptized after receiving baptism from John, while no one
needs to be baptized after receiving it from Optatus, unless it be that the former were baptized
with the baptism of John, while, whenever any one is baptized with the baptism of Christ,
whether he be baptized by Paul or by Optatus, there is no difference in the nature of his
baptism, though there is so great a difference between Paul and Optatus? Return then, O
ye transgressors, to a right mind,2099 and do not seek to weigh the sacraments of God by
considerations of the characters and deeds of men. For the sacraments are holy through
Him to whom they belong; but when taken in hand worthily, they bring reward, when unworthily,
judgment. And although the men are not one who take in hand the sacrament of
God worthily or unworthily, yet that which is taken in hand, whether worthily or unworthily,
is the same; so that it does not become better or worse in itself, but only turns to the life or
death of those who handle it in either case. And in respect of what you said, that "in those
whom Paul baptized after they had received the baptism of John, he washed off what had
already existed," you certainly would not have said it had you taken a moment to consider
what you were saying. For if the baptism of John required washing off, it must, beyond all
doubt, have had some foulness in it. Why then should I press you further? Recollect or
read, and see whence John received it, so shall you see against whom you have uttered that
blasphemy; and when you have discovered this, your heart will surely be beaten, if a rein be
not set on your tongue.</p>
<p>89. To come next to what you think you say against us with so much point: "If we do
ill in urging this, why do you seek after us?" cannot you even yet call to mind that only those
are sought after who have perished? Or is the incapacity for seeing this an element in your
ruin? For the sheep might say to the shepherd with equal absurdity, If I do wrong in straying
from the flock, why do you search after me? not understanding that the very reason why it
is being sought is because it thinks there is no need for seeking it. But who is there that
seeks for you, either through His Scriptures, or by catholic and conciliatory voices, or by
the scourgings of temporal afflictions, save only Him who dispenses that mercy to you in

all things? We therefore seek you that we may find you; for we love you that you should
have life, with the same intensity with which we hate your error, that it might be destroyed
which seeks to ruin you, so long as it is not itself involved in your destruction. And would

you are not in the whole, because you have gone aside into the part."</p>
<p>91. Augustin answered: I too indeed have attained to a very slight knowledge of the
Greek language, scarcely to be called knowledge at all, yet I am not shameless in saying that
I know that ὅλον means not "one," but "the whole;" and that καθ’ ὅλον means "according
to the whole:" whence the Catholic Church received its name, according to the saying of
the Lord, "It is not for you to know the times, which the Father hath put in His own power.
But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be
witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole

they are related to it as being its dregs, but everything that is reprobate will flow away. It is
the very sink of iniquity; according to the saying of John, ‘They went out from us, but they

There is no gold among their pollution: all that is precious has been purged away. For it is
written, ‘As gold is tried in the furnace, so also are the just tried by the harassing of tribulation.’
2104 Cruelty is not a part of gentleness, nor religion a part of sacrilege; nor can the
party of Macarius2105 in any way be part of us, because he pollutes the likeness of our rite.
For the enemy’s line, which fills up an enemy’s name, is no part of the force to which it is
opposed; but if it is truly to be called a part, it will find a suitable motto in the judgment of
Solomon, ‘Let their part be cut off from the earth.’"2106</p>
<p>93. Augustin answered: What is it but sheer madness to utter these taunts without
proving anything? You look at the tares throughout the world, and pay no heed to the
wheat, although both have been bidden to grow together throughout the whole of it. You
look at the seed sown by the wicked one, which shall be separated in the time of harvest,2107
and you pay no heed to the seed of Abraham, in which all nations of the earth shall be
blessed.2108 Just as though you were already a purged mass, and virgin honey, and refined
oil, and pure gold, or rather the very similitude of a whited wall. For, to say nothing of your
other faults, do the drunken form a portion of the sober, or are the covetous reckoned among
the portion of the wise? If men of gentle temper appropriate the term of light, where shall
the madness of the Circumcelliones be esteemed to be, excepting in the darkness? Why
then is baptism, given by men like these, held valid among you, and the same baptism of
Christ not held valid, by whatsoever men it may be administered throughout the world?
You see, in fact, that you are separated from the communion of the whole world in so far
as this, that you are not indeed all drunk, nor all of you covetous, nor all men of violence,
but that you are all heretics, and, in virtue of this, are all impious and all sacrilegious.</p>

<p>94. But as to your saying that the whole world that rejoices in Christian communion
is the party of Macarius, who with any remnant of sanity in his brain could make such a
statement? But because we say that you are of the party of Donatus, you therefore seek for
a man of whose party you may say we are; and, being in a great strait, you mention the name
of some obscure person, who, if he is known in Africa, is certainly unknown in any other
quarter of the globe. And therefore hearken to the answer made to you by all the seed of
Abraham from every corner of the earth: Of that Macarius, to whose party you assert us to
belong, we know absolutely nothing. Can you reply in turn that you know nothing of
Donatus? But even if we were to say that you are the party of Optatus, which of you can
say that he is unacquainted with Optatus, unless in the sense that he does not know him
personally, as perhaps he does not know Donatus either? But you acknowledge that you
rejoice in the name of Donatus, do you also take any pleasure in the name of Optatus? What
then can the name of Donatus profit you, when all of you alike are polluted by Optatus?
What advantage can you derive from the sobriety of Donatus, when you are defiled by the
drunkenness of the Circumcelliones? What, according to your views, are you profited by
the innocence of Donatus, when you are stained by the rapacity of Optatus? For this is your
mistake, that you think that the unrighteousness of a man has more power in infecting his
neighbor than the righteousness of a man has in purifying those around him. Therefore, if
two share in common the sacraments of God, the one a just man, the other an unrighteous
one, but so that neither the former should imitate the unrighteousness of the latter, nor the
latter the righteousness of the former, you say that the result is not that both are made just,
but that both are made unrighteous; so that also that holy thing, which both receive in
common, becomes unclean and loses its original holiness. When does unrighteousness find
for herself such advocates as these, through whose madness she is esteemed victorious?
How comes it then that, in the midst of such mistaken perversity, you congratulate yourselves
upon the name of Donatus, when it shows not that Petilianus deserves to be what Donatus
is, but that Donatus is compelled to be what Optatus is? But let the house of Israel say, "God
is my portion for ever;"2109 let the seed of Abraham say in all nations "The Lord is the portion
of mine inheritance."2110 For they know how to speak through the gospel of the glory of
the blessed God. For you, too, through the sacrament which is in you, like Caiaphas the
persecutor of the Lord, prophesy without being aware of it.2111 For what in Greek is expressed
by the word Μαχάριος is in our language simply "Blessed;" and in this way certainly
we are of the party of Macarius, the Blessed One. For what is more blessed than Christ, of
whose party we are, after whom all the ends of the earth are called, and to whom they all

<pb n="1079"/>
are turned, and in whose sight all the countries of the nations worship? Therefore the party
of this Macarius, that is to say, of this Blessed One, feels no apprehension at your last curse,
distorted from the words of Solomon, lest it should perish from the earth. For what is said
by him of the impious you endeavor to apply to the inheritance of Christ, and you strive to
prove that this has been achieved with inexpressible impiety; for when he was speaking of
the impious, he says, "Let their portion perish from off the earth."2112 But when you say,
with reference to the words of Scripture, "I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance,"
2113 and "all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord,"2114 that
the promise contained in them has already perished from the earth, you are seeking to turn
against the inheritance of Christ what was foretold about the lot of the impious; but so long
as the inheritance of Christ endures and increases, you are perishing in saying such things.
For you are not in every case prophesying through the sacrament of God, since in this case
you are merely uttering evil wishes through your own madness. But the prophecy of the
true prophets is more powerful than the evil speaking of the false prophets.</p>

yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and
what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or
what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?’"2115</p>
<p>96. Augustin answered: I recognize the words of the apostle; but how they can help
you I cannot see at all. For which of us says that there is any fellowship between righteousness
and unrighteousness, even though the righteous and the unrighteous, as in the case of Judas
and Peter, should be alike partakers of the sacraments? For from one and the same holy
thing Judas received judgment to himself and Peter salvation, just as you received the sacrament
with Optatus, and, if you were unlike him, were not therefore partakers in his robberies.
Or is robbery not unrighteousness? Who would be mad enough to assert that? What fellowship
was there, then, on the part of your righteousness with his unrighteousness, when
you approached together to the same altar?</p>

<p>101. Petilianus said: "Can it be that the traitor Judas hung himself for
you, or did he imbue you with his character, that, following his deeds, you should seize on
the treasures of the Church, and sell for money to the powers of this world us who are the
heirs of Christ?"</p>
<p>102. Augustin answered: Judas did not die for us, but Christ, to whom the Church
dispersed throughout the world says, "So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth
me: for I trust in Thy word."2117 When, therefore, I hear the words of the Lord,
saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria,
and even in the whole earth,"2118 and through the voice of His prophet, "Their sound is
gone out through all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world,"2119 no bodily
admixture of evil ever is able to disturb me, if I know how to say, "Be surety for Thy servant
for good: let not the proud oppress me."2120 I do not, therefore, concern myself about a
vain calumniation when I have a substantial promise. But if you complain about matters
or places appertaining to the Church, which you used once to hold, and hold no longer,
then the Jews also may say that they are righteous, and reproach us with unrighteousness,
because the Christians now occupy the place in which of old they impiously reigned. What
then is there unfitting, if, according to a similar will of the Lord, the Catholics now hold the
things which formerly the heretics used to have? For against all such men as this, that is to
say, against all impious and unrighteous men, those words of the Lord have force, "The
kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
thereof;"2121 or is it written in vain, "The righteous shall eat of the labors of the impious"?2122
Wherefore you ought rather to be amazed that you still possess something, than that there
is something which you have lost. But neither need you wonder even at this, for it is by
degrees that the whitened wall falls down. Yet look back at the followers of Maximianus,
see what places they possessed, and by whose agency and under whose attacks they were
driven from them, and do you venture, if you can, to say that to suffer things like these is
righteousness, while to do them is unrighteousness. In the first place, because you did the
deed, and they suffered them; and secondly, because, according to the rule of this righteousness,
you are found to be inferior. For they were driven from the ancient palaces by Catholic
emperors acting through judges, while you are not even driven forth by the mandates of
the emperors themselves from the basilicas of unity. For what reason is this, save that you

the betrayer, the robber, the oppressor, the separater of husband and wife; but far be it from
me that the desire of returning an evil word should provoke me into any falsehood: for
neither do you put on Optatus, nor we Judas. Therefore, if each one who comes to us shall
answer to our questions that he has been baptized in the name of Optatus, he shall be baptized
in the name of Christ; and if you baptized any that came from us and said that they had
been baptized in the name of the traitor Judas, in that case we have no fault to find with
what you have done. But if they had been baptized in the name of Christ, do you not see
what an error you commit in thinking that the sacraments of God can undergo change
through any changeableness of human sins, or be polluted by defilement in the life of any
man?</p>

be alike, there is a great difference in the reality, that the way of righteousness should not
be defiled by fellowship in a name. "</p>
<p>106. Augustin answered: You have been afraid of the comparison of your numbers
with the multitude throughout the world; and therefore, in order to win praise for the
scantiness of your party, you have sought to bring in the comparison of yourself walking in
the narrow path. Would to God that you had betaken yourself not to its praise, but to the
path itself! Truly you would have seen that there was the same scantiness in the Church of
all nations; but that the righteous are said to be few in comparison with the multitude of
the unrighteous, just as, in comparison with the chaff, there may be said to be few grains of
corn in the most abundant crop, and yet these very grains of themselves, when brought into
a heap, fill the barn. For the followers of Maximianus themselves will surpass you in this
scantiness of number, if you think that righteousness consists in this, as well as in the persecution
involved in the loss of places which they held.</p>

<p>107. Petilianus said: "In the first Psalm David separates the blessed from
the impious, not indeed making them into parties, but excluding all the impious from
holiness. ‘Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
in the way of sinners.’ Let him who had strayed from the path of righteousness, so that he
should perish, return to it again. ‘Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.’2124 When he gives
this warning, O ye miserable men, why do you sit in that seat? ‘But his delight is in the law
of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season: his leaf also shall
not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The ungodly are not so: but are like the
chaff which the wind driveth away.’ He blindeth their eyes, so that they should not see.
‘Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of
the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly
shall perish.’"2125</p>
<p>108. Augustin answered: Who is there in the Scriptures that would not distinguish
between these two classes of men? But you slanderously charge the corn with the offenses
of the chaff; and being yourselves mere chaff, you boast yourselves to be the only corn. But
the true prophets declare that both these classes have been mingled together throughout
the whole world, that is, throughout the whole corn-field of the Lord, until the winnowing
which is to take place on the day of judgment. But I advise you to read that first Psalm in
the Greek version, and then you will not venture to reproach the whole world with being
of the party of Macarius; because you will perhaps come to understand of what Macarius
there is a party among all the saints, who throughout all nations are blessed in the seed of
Abraham. For what stands in our language as "Blessed is the man," is in Greek Μαχάριος
ἀνήρ. But that Macarius who offends you, if he is a bad man, neither belongs to this division,
nor is to its prejudice. But if he is a good man, let him prove his own work, that he may
have glory in himself alone, and not in another.2126</p>

<p>109. Petilianus said: "But the same Psalmist has sung the praises of our
baptism. ‘The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in the
green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me
in the paths of righteousness for His name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death,’—though the persecutor, he means, should slay me,—‘I will fear no
evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me.’ It was by this that it
conquered Goliath, being armed with the anointing oil. ‘Thou hast prepared a table before
me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth
over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord for ever.’"2127</p>
<p>110. Augustin answered: This psalm speaks of those who receive baptism aright, and
use as holy what is so holy. For those words have no reference even to Simon Magus, who
yet received the same holy baptism; and because he would not use it in a holy way, he did
not therefore pollute it, or show that in such cases it should be repeated. But since you have
made mention of Goliath, listen to the psalm which treats of Goliath himself, and see that
he is portrayed in a new song; for there it is said, "I will sing a new song unto Thee, O God:
upon a psaltery, and an instrument of ten strings, will I sing praise unto Thee."2128 And
see whether he belongs to this song who refuses to communicate with the whole earth. For
elsewhere it is said, "O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth."2129
Therefore the whole earth, with whom you are not in unity, sings the new song. And these
too are the words of the whole earth, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want," etc. These
are not the words of the tares, though they be endured until the harvest in the same crop.
They are not the words of the chaff, but of the wheat, although they are nourished by one
and the same rain, and are threshed out on the same threshing-floor at the same time, till
they shall be separated the one from the other by the winnowing at the last day. And yet
these both assuredly have the same baptism, though they are not the same themselves. But
if your party also were the Church of God, you would certainly confess that this psalm has
no application to the infuriated bands of the Circumcelliones. Or if they too themselves are
led through the paths of righteousness, why do you deny that they are your associates, when
you are reproached with them, although, for the most part, you console yourselves for the
scantiness of your section, not by the rod and staff of the Lord, but by the cudgels of the
Circumcelliones, with which you think that you are safe even against the Roman laws,—to
bring oneself into collision with which is surely nothing less than to walk through the valley
of the shadow of death? But he with whom the Lord is, fears no evils. Surely, however, you

<pb n="1089"/>
will not venture to say that the words which are sung in this song belong even to those infuriated
men, and yet you not only acknowledge, but ostentatiously set forth the fact that
they have baptism. These words, therefore, are not used by any who are not refreshed by
the holy water, as are all the righteous men of God; not by those who are brought to destruction
by using it, as was that magician when baptized by Philip: and yet the water itself in
both kinds of men is the same, and of the same degree of sanctity. These words are not used
except by those who will belong to the right hand; but yet both sheep and goats feed in the
same pasture under one Shepherd, until they shall be separated, that they may receive their
due reward. These words are not used except by those who, like Peter, receive life from the
table of the Lord, not judgment, as did Judas; and yet the supper was itself the same to both,
but it was not of the same profit to both, because they were not one. These words are not
used except by those who, by being anointed with the sacred oil, are blessed in spirit also,
as was David; not merely consecrated in the body only, as was Saul: and yet, as they had
both received the same outward sign, it was not the sacrament, but the personal merit that
was different in the two cases. These words are not used except by those who, with converted
heart, receive the cup of the Lord unto eternal life; not by those who eat and drink damnation
to themselves, as the apostle says:2130 and yet, though they are not one, the cup which they
receive is one, exerting its power on the martyrs that they should obtain a heavenly reward,
not on the Circumcelliones, that they should mark precipices with death. Remember,
therefore, that the characters of bad men in no wise interfere with the virtue of the sacraments,
so that their holiness should either be destroyed, or even diminished; but that they
injure the unrighteous men themselves, that they should have them as witnesses of their
damnation, not as aids to health. For beyond all doubt you should have taken into consideration
the actual concluding words of this psalm, and have understood that, on account
of those who forsake the faith after they have been baptized, it cannot be said by all who
receive holy baptism that "I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever:" and yet, whether
they abide in the faith, or whether they have fallen away, though they themselves are not
one, their baptism is one, and though they themselves are not both holy, yet the baptism in
both is holy; because even apostates, if they return, are not baptized as though they had lost
the sacrament, but undergo humiliation, because they have done a despite to it which remains
in them.</p>

<p>111. Petilianus said: "Yet that you should not call yourselves holy, in the
first place, I declare that no one has holiness who has not led a life of innocence."</p>
<p>112. Augustin answered: Show us the tribunal where you have been enthroned as judge,
that the whole world should stand for trial before you, and with what eyes you have inspected
and discussed, I do not say the consciences, but even the acts of all men, that you should
say that the whole world has lost its innocence. He who was carried up as far as the third
heaven says, "Yea, I judge not mine own self;" 2131 and do you venture to pronounce sentence
on the whole world, throughout which the inheritance of Christ is spread abroad? In the
next place, if what you have said appears to you to be sufficiently certain, that "no one has
holiness who has not led a life of innocence," I would ask you, if Saul had not the holiness
of the sacrament, what was in him that David reverenced? But if he had innocence, why
did he persecute the innocent? For it was on account of the sanctity of his anointing that
David honored him while alive, and avenged him after he was dead; and because he cut off
so much as a scrap from his garment, he trembled with a panic-stricken heart. Here you
see that Saul had not innocence, and yet he had holiness,—not the personal holiness of a
holy life (for that no one can have without innocence), but the holiness of the sacrament of
God, which is holy even in unrighteous men.</p>

<p>113. Petilianus said: "For, granting that you faithless ones are acquainted
with the law, without any prejudice to the law itself, I may say so much as this, the devil
knows it too. For in the case of righteous Job he answered the Lord God concerning the
law as though he were himself righteous, as it is written, "And the Lord said unto Satan,
Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man without
malice, a true worshipper of God abstaining from every evil; and still he holdeth fast his
integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause?"2132 And
Satan answered the Lord, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. Behold
he speaks in legal phrase, even when he is striving against the law. And a second time he
endeavored thus to tempt the Lord Christ with his discourse, as it is written, ‘The devil
taketh Jesus into the holy city, and setteth Him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto
Him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give His angels
charge concerning thee; and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou
dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shall not tempt
the Lord thy God.’2133 You know the law, I say, as did the devil, who is conquered in his
endeavors, and blushes in his deeds."</p>
<p>114. Augustin answered: I might indeed ask of you in what law the words are written
which the devil used when he was uttering calumnies against the holy man Job, if the position
which I am set to prove were this, that you yourself are unacquainted with the law which
you assert the devil to have known, but as this is not the question at issue between us, I pass
it by. But you have endeavored in such sort to prove that the devil is skilled in the law, as
though we maintained that all who know the law are just. Accordingly, I do not see in what
manner you are assisted by what you have chosen to quote concerning the devil,—unless,
indeed, it may be that we should be thereby reminded how you imitate the devil himself.
For as he brought forward the words of the law against the Author of the law, so you also
out of the words of the law bring accusation against men whom you do not know, that you
may resist the promises of God which are made in that very self-same law. Then I should
be glad if you would tell me in whose honor do those confessors of yours achieve their
martyrdom, when they throw themselves over precipices,—in honor of Christ, who thrust
the devil from Him when he made a like suggestion, or rather in honor of the devil himself,
who suggested such a deed to Christ? There are two especially vile and customary deaths
resorted to by those who kill themselves,—hanging and the precipice. You assuredly said
in the earlier part of this epistle, "The traitor hung himself: he left this death to all who are
like him." This has no application whatever to us; for we refuse to reverence with the name
of martyr any who have strangled themselves. With how much greater show of reason

might we say against you, That master of all traitors, the devil, wished to persuade Christ
to throw Himself headlong down, and was repulsed! What, therefore, must we say of those
whom he persuaded with success? What, indeed, except that they are the enemies of Christ,
the friends of the devil, the disciples of the seducer, the fellow-disciples of the traitor? For
both have learned to kill themselves from the same master,—Judas by hanging himself, the
others by throwing themselves over precipices.</p>

we said before, you assuredly have that one of which the prophet and psalmist David speaks
as being the seat of the scornful.2134 For to you it is rightly left, seeing that the holy cannot
sit therein."</p>
<p>118. Augustin answered: Here again you do not see that this is no kind of argument,
but empty abuse. For this is what I said a little while ago, You utter the words of the law,
but take no heed against whom you utter them; just as the devil uttered the words of the
law, but failed to perceive to whom he uttered them. He wished to thrust down our Head,
who was presently to ascend on high; but you wish to reduce to a small fraction the body
of that same Head which is dispersed throughout the entire world. Certainly you yourself
said a little time before that we know the law, and speak in legal terms, but blush in our
deeds. Thus much indeed you say without a proof of anything; but even though you were
to prove it of some men, you would not be entitled to assert it of these others. However, if
all men throughout all the world were of the character which you most vainly charge them
with, what has the chair done to you of the Roman Church, in which Peter sat, and which
Anastasius fills to-day; or the chair of the Church of Jerusalem, in which James once sat,
and in which John sits today, with which we are united in catholic unity, and from which
you have severed yourselves by your mad fury? Why do you call the apostolic chair a seat
of the scornful? If it is on account of the men whom you believe to use the words of the law
without performing it, do you find that our Lord Jesus Christ was moved by the Pharisees,
of whom He says, "They say, and do not," to do any despite to the seat in which they sat?
Did He not commend the seat of Moses, and maintain the honor of the seat, while He convicted
those that sat in it? For He says, "They sit in Moses’ seat: all therefore whatsoever
they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and
do not."2135 If you were to think of these things, you would not, on account of men whom
you calumniate, do despite to the apostolic seat, in which you have no share. But what else
is conduct like yours but ignorance of what to say, combined with want of power to abstain
from evil-speaking?</p>

<p>119. Petilianus said: "If you suppose that you can offer sacrifice, God
Himself thus speaks of you as most abandoned sinners: ‘The wicked man,’ He says, ‘that
sacrificeth a calf is as if he cut off a dog’s neck; and he that offereth an oblation, as if he
offered swine’s blood.’2136 Recognize herein your sacrifice, who have already poured out
human blood. And again He says, ‘Their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of
mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted.’"2137</p>
<p>120. Augustin answered: We say that in the case of every man the sacrifice that is
offered partakes of the character of him who approaches to offer it, or approaches to partake
of it; and that those eat of the sacrifices of such men, who in approaching to them partake
of the character of those who offer them. Therefore, if a bad man offer sacrifice to God, and
a good man receive it at his hands, the sacrifice is to each man of such character as he himself
has shown himself to be, since we find it also written that "unto the pure all things are
pure."2138 In accordance with this true and catholic judgment, you too are free from pollution
by the sacrifice of Optatus, if you disapproved of his deeds. For certainly his bread was the
bread of mourners, seeing that all Africa was mourning under his iniquities. But the evil
involved in the schism of all your party makes this bread of mourners common to you all.
For, according to the judgment of your Council, Felicianus of Musti was a shedder of man’s
blood. For you said, in condemning them,2139 "Their feet are swift to shed blood."2140 See
therefore what kind of sacrifice he offers whom you hold to be a priest, when you have
yourselves convicted him of sacrilege. And if you think that this is in no way to your prejudice,
I would ask you how the emptiness of your calumnies can be to the prejudice of the
whole world?</p>

<p>121. Petilianus said: "If you make prayer to God, or utter supplication,
it profits you absolutely nothing whatsoever. For your blood-stained conscience makes
your feeble prayers of no effect; because the Lord God regards purity of conscience more
than the words of supplication, according to the saying of the Lord Christ, ‘Not every one
that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth
the will of my Father which is in heaven.’2141 The will of God unquestionably is good, for
therefore we pray as follows in the holy prayer, ‘Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,’
2142 that, as His will is good, so it may confer on us whatever may be good. You therefore
do not do the will of God, because you do what is evil every day."</p>
<p>122. Augustin answered: If we on our side were to utter against you all that you assert
against us, would not any one who heard us consider that we were rather insane litigants
than Christian disputants, if he himself were in his senses? We do not, therefore, render
for railing. For it is not fitting that the servant of the Lord should strive; but he should be
gentle unto all men, willing to learn, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.
2143 If, therefore, we reproach you with those who daily do what is evil among you,
we are guilty of striving unbefittingly, accusing one for the sins of another. But if we admonish
you, that as you are unwilling that these things should be brought against yourselves, so
you should abstain from bringing against us the sins of other men, we then in meekness are
instructing you, solely in the hope that some time you will return to a better mind.</p>

themselves yield neither to your faith nor to your merits, but are driven out in the name of
the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>124. Augustin answered: God be thanked that you have at length confessed that the
invocation of the name of Christ may be of profit for the salvation of others, even though
it be invoked by sinners! Hence, therefore, you may understand that when the name of
Christ is invoked, the sins of one man do not stand in the way of the salvation of another.
But to determine in what manner we invoke the name of Christ, we require not your judgment,
but the judgment of Christ Himself who is invoked by us; for He alone can know in
what spirit He is invoked. Yet from His own words we are assured that He is invoked to
their salvation by all nations, who are blessed in the seed of Abraham.</p>

<p>125. Petilianus said: "Even though you do very virtuous actions, and
perform miraculous works, yet on account of your wickedness the Lord does not know you;
even so, according to the words of the Lord Himself, ‘Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name? and in Thy name have cast out devils? and in
Thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew
you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.’"2144</p>
<p>126. Augustin answered: We acknowledge the word of the Lord. Hence also the apostle
says, "Though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
nothing."2145 Here therefore we must inquire who it is that has charity: you will find that
it is no one else but those who are lovers of unity. For as to the driving out of devils, and
as to the working of miracles, seeing that very many do not do such things who yet belong
to the kingdom of God, and very many do them who do not belong to it, neither our party
nor your party have any cause for boasting, if any of them chance to have this power, since
the Lord did not think it right that even the apostles, who could truly do such things both
to profit and salvation, should boast in things like this, when He says to them, "In this rejoice
not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written
in heaven."2146 Wherefore all those things which you have advanced from the writings of
the gospel I also might repeat to you, if I saw you working the powerful acts of signs and
miracles; and so might you repeat them to me, if you saw me doing things of a like sort. Let
us not, therefore, say one to another what may equally be said on the other side as well; and,
putting aside all quibbles, since we are inquiring where the Church of Christ is to be found,
let us listen to the words of Christ Himself, who redeemed it with His own blood: "Ye shall
be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the
whole earth."2147 You see then who it is with whom a man refuses to communicate who
will not communicate with this Church, which is spread throughout all the world, if at least
you hear whose words these are. For what is a greater proof of madness than to hold communion
with the sacraments of the Lord, and to refuse to hold communion with the words
of the Lord? Such men at any rate are likely to say, In Thy name have we eaten and drunken,
and to hear the words, "I never knew you," 2148 seeing that they eat His body and drink His
blood in the sacrament, and do not recognize in the gospel His members which are spread
abroad throughout the earth, and therefore are not themselves counted among them in the
judgment.</p>

<p>131. Petilianus said: "It is written, ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor.’ When you falsely declare to the kings of this world that we hold your
opinions, do you not make up a falsehood?"</p>
<p>132. Augustin answered: If those are not our opinions which you hold, neither were
they your opinions which you received from the followers of Maximianus. But if they were
therefore yours, because they were guilty of a sacrilegious schism in not communicating
with the party of Donatus, take heed what ground you occupy, and with whose inheritance
you refuse communion, and consider what answer you can make, not to the kings of this
world, but to Christ your King. Of Him it is said, "He shall have dominion also from sea to
sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth."2150 From what river does it mean, save
that where He was baptized, and where the dove descended on Him, that mighty token of
charity and unity? But you refuse communion with this unity, and occupy as yet the place
of unity; and you bring us into disfavor with the kings of this world in making use of the
edicts of the proconsul to expel your schismatics from the place of the party of Donatus.
These are not mere words flying at random through the empty void: the men are still alive,
the states bear witness to the fact, the archives of the proconsuls and of the several towns
are quoted in evidence of it. Let then the voice of calumny be at length silent, which would
bring up against the whole earth the kings of this world, through whose proconsuls you,
yourselves a fragment, would not spare the fragment which was separated from you. When
then we say that you hold our opinions, we are not shown to be bearing false witness, unless
you can show that we are not in the Church of Christ, which indeed you never cease alleging,
but never will be able to establish; nay, in real truth, when you say this, you are bringing a
charge of false witness no longer against us, but against the Lord Himself. For we are in the
Church which was foretold by His own testimony, and where He bore witness to His witnesses,
saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in
Samaria, and even in the whole earth." But you show yourselves to be false witnesses not
only from this, that you resist this truth, but also in the very trial in which you joined issue
with the schism of Maximianus. For if you were acting according to the law of Christ, how
much more consistently do certain Christian emperors frame ordinances in accordance
with it, if even pagan proconsuls can follow its behests in passing judgment? But if you
thought that even the laws of an earthly empire were to be summoned to your aid, we do
not blame you for this. It is what Paul did when he bore witness before his adversaries that
he was a Roman citizen.2151 But I would ask by what earthly laws it is ordained that the
followers of Maximianus should be driven from their place? You will find no law whatever
to this effect. But, in point of fact, you have chosen to expel them under laws which have
<note type="footnote">2150 Ps. lxxii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">2151 Acts xxii. 25.</note>

<pb n="1102"/>
been passed against heretics, and against yourselves among their number. You, as though
by superior strength, have prevailed against the weak. Whence they, being wholly powerless,
say that they are innocent, like the wolf in the power of the lion. Yet surely you could not
use laws which were passed against yourselves as instruments against others, except by the
aid of false witness. For if those laws are founded on truth, then do you come down from
the position which you occupy; but if on falsehood, why did you use them to drive others
from the Church? But how if they both are founded on truth, and could not be used by you
for the expulsion of others except with the aid of falsehood? For that the judges might
submit to their authority, they were willing to expel heretics from the Church, from which
they ought first to have expelled yourselves; but you declared yourselves to be Catholics,
that you might escape the severity of the laws which you employed to oppress others. It is
for you to determine what you appear to yourselves among yourselves; at any rate, under
those laws you are not Catholics. Why then have you either made them false, if they are
true, by your false witness, or made use of them, if they are false, for the oppression of others?</p>

other than ourselves, who remain in unity, not in accordance with the calumnies of men,
but with the words of Christ, in whom all the nations of the whole earth are blessed. Nor
do we separate ourselves from the society of the wheat, on account of the unrighteous men
whom we cannot separate from the wheat of the Lord before the winnowing at the judgment;
and if there are any things which you who are cut off begin already to possess, we do not,
because the Lord has given to us what has been taken away from you, therefore covet our
neighbors’ goods, seeing that they have been made ours by the authority of Him to whom
all things belong; and they are rightly ours, for you were wont to use them for purposes of
schism, but we use them for the promotion of unity. Otherwise your party might reproach
even the first people of God with coveting their neighbors’ goods, seeing that they were
driven forth before their face by the power of God, because they used the land amiss; and
the Jews in turn themselves, from whom the kingdom was taken away, according to the
words of the Lord, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,2153 may bring a
charge against that nation, of coveting their neighbors’ goods, because the Church of Christ
is in possession where the persecutors of Christ were wont to reign. And, after all, when it
has been said to yourselves, You are coveting the goods of other men, because you have
driven out from the basilicas the followers of Maximianus, you are at a loss to find any answer

you wretched men as follows: ‘Whosoever shall break one of these commandments, he shalt
be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.’"</p>
<p>138. Augustin answered: When you happen to quote the testimony of Scripture as
other than it really is, and it does not bear on the question which is at issue between us, I
am not greatly concerned; but when it interferes with the matter on hand, unless it is quoted
truly, then I think that you have no right to find fault if I remind you how the passage really
stands. For you must be aware that the verse which you quoted is not as you quoted it, but
rather thus: "Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men
so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." And immediately He continues,
"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness
of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."2154 For
elsewhere He shows and proves of the Pharisees that they say and do not. It is these, therefore,
to whom He is referring also here, when He said, "Whosoever shall break one of these
commandments, and shall teach men so,"—that is, shall teach in words what he has violated
in deeds; whose righteousness He says that our righteousness must excel, in that we must
both keep the commandments and teach men so. And yet not even on account of those
Pharisees, with whom you compare us,—not from any motives of prudence, but from
malice,—did our Lord enjoin that the seat of Moses should be deserted, which seat He
doubtless meant to be a figure of His own; for He said indeed that they who sat in Moses’
seat were ever saying and not doing, but warns the people to do what they say, and not to
do what they do,2155 lest the chair, with all its holiness, should be deserted, and the unity
of the flock divided through the faithlessness of the shepherds.</p>

sin is without the body; but he that sinneth in the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him,
neither in this world, neither in the world to come.’"</p>
<p>140. Augustin answered: This too is not written as you have quoted it, and see how far
it has led you astray. The apostle, writing to the Corinthians, says, "Every sin that a man
doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own
body."2156 But this is one thing, and that is another which the Lord said in the gospel: "All
manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but whosoever speaketh against
the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to
come."2157 But you have begun a sentence from the writing of the apostle, and ended it as
though it were one from the gospel, which I fancy you have done not with any intention to
deceive, but through mistake; for neither passage has any bearing on the matter in hand.
And why you have said this, and in what sense you have said it, I am wholly unable to perceive,
unless it be that, whereas you had said above that all were condemned by the Lord
who had broken any one of His commandments, you have considered since how many there
are in your party who break not one but many of them; and lest an objection should be
brought against you on that score, you have sought, by way of surpassing the difficulty, to
bring in a distinction of sins, whereby it might be seen that it is one thing to break a commandment
in respect of which pardon may easily be obtained, another thing to sin against
the Holy Ghost, which shall receive no forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to
come. In your dread, therefore, of infection from sin, you were unwilling to pass this over
in silence; and again, in your dread of a question too deep for your powers, you wish to
touch cursorily on it in passing, in such a state of agitation, that, just as men who are setting
about a task in haste, and consequent confusion, are wont to fasten their dress or shoes
awry, so you have not thought fit either to see what belongs to what, or in what context or
what sense the passage which you quote occurs. But what is the nature of that sin which
shall not be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come, you are so far from
knowing, that, though you believe that we are actually living in it, you yet promise us forgiveness
of it through your baptism. And yet how could this be possible, if the sin be of
such a nature that it cannot be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come?</p>

mercy.’ But how shall I call you merciful when you inflict punishment on the righteous?
Shall I not rather call you a most unrighteous communion, so long as you pollute souls?"</p>
<p>150. Augustin answered: You have proved neither point,—neither that you yourselves
are righteous, nor that we inflict punishment on even the unrighteous; and yet, even as false
flattery is generally cruel, so just correction is ever merciful. For whence is that which you
do not understand: "Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove
me"? For while he says this of the severity of merciful correction, the Psalmist immediately
went on to say of the gentleness of destructive flattery, "But the oil of sinners shall not break
my head."2161 Do you therefore consider whither you are called, and from what you are
summoned away. For how do you know what feelings he entertains towards you whom
you suppose to be cruel? But whatever be his feelings, every one must bear his own burden
both with us and with you. But I would have you cast away the burden of schism which
you all of you are bearing, that you may bear your good burdens in unity; and I would bid
you mercifully correct, if you should have the power, all those who are bearing evil burdens;
and, if this be beyond your power, I would bid you bear with them in peace.</p>

<p>153. Petilianus said: "‘Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called
the children of God.’2162 You make a pretence of peace by your wickedness, and seek unity
by war."</p>
<p>154. Augustin answered: We do not make a pretense of peace by wickedness, but we
preach peace out of the gospel; and if you were at peace with it, you would be at peace also
with us. The risen Lord, when presenting Himself to the disciples, not only that they should
gaze on Him with their eyes, but also that they should handle Him with their hands, began
His discourse to them with the words, "Peace be unto you." And how this peace itself was
to be maintained, He disclosed to them in the words which followed. For "then opened He
their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus
is it written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day;
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations,
beginning at Jerusalem."2163 If you will keep peace with these words, you will not be at
variance with us. For if we seek unity by war, our war could not be praised in more glorious
terms, seeing that it is written, "Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself."2164 And again it
is written, "No man ever yet hated his own flesh."2165 And yet the flesh lusteth against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.2166 But if no man ever yet hated his own flesh, and
yet a man lusteth against his own flesh, here you have unity sought by war, that the body,
being subject to correction, may be brought under submission. But what the spirit does
against the flesh, waging war with it, not in hatred but in love, this those who are spiritual
do against those who are carnal, that they may do towards them what they do towards
themselves, because they love their neighbors as neighbors indeed. But the war which the
spiritual wage is that correction which is in love: their sword is the word of God. To such
a war they are aroused by the trumpet of the apostle sounding with a mighty force: "Preach
the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering
and doctrine."2167 See then that we act not with the sword, but with the word. But you
answer what is not true, while you accuse us falsely. You do not correct your own faults,
and you bring against us those of other men. Christ bears true witness concerning the nations
of the earth; you, in opposition to Christ, bear false witness against the nations of the earth.
If we were to believe you rather than Christ, you would call us peacemakers; because we
believe Christ rather than you, we are said to make a pretense of peace by our wickedness.

where is there peace?" what will you show? Will you show the party of Donatus, unknown
to the countless nations to whom Christ is known? It is surely not the city which cannot be

<p>161. Petilianus said: "Since then you are not blessed by falsifying the
commands of God, the Lord Christ condemns you by His divine decrees: ‘Woe unto you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for
ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and
when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. Woe unto
you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and
have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye
to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat,
and swallow a camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto
whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but are within full of dead
men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men,
but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.’"2174</p>
<p>162. Augustin answered: Tell me whether you have said anything which may not equally
be said against you in turn by any slanderous and evil-speaking tongue. But from what has
been said by me before, any one who wishes may find out that these things may be said
against you, not by way of empty abuse, but with the support of truthful testimony. As,
however, the opportunity is presented to us we must not pass this by. There is no doubt
that to the ancient people of God circumcision stood in the place of baptism. I ask, therefore,
putting the case that the Pharisees against whom those words you quote are spoken, had
made some proselyte, who, if he were to imitate them, would, as it is said, become twofold
more the child of hell than themselves, supposing that he were to be converted, and desire
to imitate Simeon, or Zacharias, or Nathanael, would it be necessary that he should be circumcised
again by them? And if it is absurd to put this case why, although in empty fashion
and with empty sounds you compare us to men like this, do you nevertheless baptize after
us? But if you are really men like this, how much better and how much more in accordance
with truth do we act in not baptizing after you, as neither was it right that those whom I
have mentioned should be circumcised after the worst of Pharisees! Furthermore, when
such men sit in the seat of Moses, for which the Lord preserved its due honor, why do you
blaspheme the apostolic chair on account of men whom, justly or unjustly, you compare
with these?</p>

<p>163. Petilianus said: "But these things do not alarm us Christians; for of
the evil deeds which you are destined to commit we have before a warning given us by the
Lord Christ. ‘Behold,’ He says, ‘I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.’2175 You
fill up the measure of the madness of wolves, who either lay or are preparing to lay snares
against the Churches in precisely the same way in which wolves, with their mouths wide
open against the fold, even with destructive eagerness, breathe forth panting anger from
their jaws, suffused with blood."</p>
<p>164. Augustin answered: I should be glad to utter the same sentiment against you, but
not in the words which you have used: they are too inappropriate, or rather mad. But what
was required was, that you should show that we were wolves and that you were sheep, not
by the emptiest of evil-speaking, but by some distinct proofs. For when I too have said, We
are sheep, and you are wolves, do you think that there is any difference caused by the fact
that you express the idea in swelling words? But listen whilst I prove what I assert. For the
Lord says in the gospel, as you know full well, whether you please it or not, "My sheep hear
my voice, and follow me."2176 There are many sayings of the Lord on different subjects;
but supposing, for example, that any one were in doubt whether the same Lord had risen
in the body, and His words were to be quoted where He says, "Handle me, and see; for a
spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have;"—if even after this he should be unwilling
to acquiesce in the belief that His body had risen from the dead, surely such a man could
not be reckoned among the sheep of the Lord, because he would not hear His voice. And
so too now, when the question between us is, Where is the Church? whilst we quote the
words that follow in the same passage of the gospel, where, after His resurrection, He gave
His body even to be handled by those who were in doubt, in which He showed the future
wide extent of the Church, saying, "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer,
and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should
be preached in His name throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem;"2177 whereas you
will not communicate with all nations, in whom these words have been fulfilled, how are
you the sheep of this Shepherd, whose words you not only do not obey when you have heard
them, but even fight against them? And so we show to you from this that you are not sheep.
But listen further whence we show you that, on the contrary, you are wolves. For necessarily,
when it is shown by His own words where the Church is to be found, it is also clear where
we must look for the fold of Christ. Whenever, therefore, any sheep separate themselves
from this fold, which is expressly pointed out and shown to us by the unmistakeable declaration
of the Lord,—and that, I will not say because of charges falsely brought, but on account

of charges brought, as no one can deny, with great uncertainty against their fellow-men,
and consequently slay those sheep which they have torn and alienated from the life of unity
and Christian love—is it not evident that they are ravening wolves? But it will be said that
these very men themselves praise and preach the Lord Christ. They are therefore those of
whom He says Himself, "They come unto you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are
ravening wolves. By their fruits ye shall know them."2178 The sheep’s clothing is seen in
the praises of Christ; the fruits of their wolfish nature in their slanderous teeth.</p>

heathen, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils among false brethren.’2181 And again

brethren like yourselves assault us, we imitate the patience of our master Paul under our
dangers."</p>
<p>170. Augustin answered: Certainly those of whom you speak are false brethren, of
whom the apostle thus complains in another place, where he is extolling the natural sincerity
of Timothy: "I have no man," he says, "like-minded, who will naturally care for your state.
For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s."2183 Undoubtedly he was
speaking of those who were with him at the time when he was writing that epistle; for it
could not be that all Christians in every quarter of the earth were seeking their own, and
not the things which were Jesus Christ’s. It was of those, therefore, as I said, who were with
him at the time when he was writing the words which you have quoted, that he uttered this
lamentation. For who else was it to whom he referred, when he says in another place,
"Without were fightings, within were fears,"2184 except those whom he feared all the more
intensely because they were within? If, therefore, you would imitate Paul, you would be
tolerant of false brethren within, not a slanderer of the innocent without.</p>

<p>171. Petilianus said: "For what kind of faith is that which is in you which
is devoid of charity? when Paul himself says, ‘Though I speak with the tongues of men, and
have the knowledge of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and
all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.’"</p>
<p>172. Augustin answered: This is what I said just now, that you were desirous to be clad
in sheep’s clothing, that, if possible, the sheep might feel your bite before it had any consciousness
of your approach. Is it not that praise of charity in which you indulge that
commonly proves your calumny in the clearest light of truth? Will you bring it about that
those arms shall be no longer ours, because you endeavor to appropriate them first? Furthermore,
these arms are endowed with life: from whatever quarter they are launched, they
recognize whom they should destroy. If they have been sent forth from our hands, they will
fix themselves in you; if they are aimed by you, they recoil upon yourselves. For in these
apostolic words, which commend the excellence of charity, we are wont to show to you how
profitless it is to man that he should be in possession of faith or of the sacraments, when he
has not charity, that, when you come to Catholic unity, you may understand what it is that
is conferred on you, and how great a thing it is of which you were at least to some extent in
want; for Christian charity cannot be preserved except in the unity of the Church: and that
so you may see that without it you are nothing, even though you may be in possession of
baptism and faith, and through this latter may be able even to remove mountains. But if
this is your opinion as well, let us not repudiate and reject in you either the sacraments of
God which we know, or faith itself, but let us hold fast charity, without which we are nothing
even with the sacraments and with faith. But we hold fast charity if we cling to unity; while
we cling to unity, if we do not make a fictitious unity in a party by our own words, but recognize
it in a united whole through the words of Christ.</p>

<p>173. Petilianus said: "And again, ‘Charity suffereth long, and is kind;
charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly,
seeketh not her own.’ But you seek what belongs to other men. ‘Is not easily provoked,
thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things,
endureth all things. Charity never faileth.’ 2185 This is to say, in short, Charity does not
persecute, does not inflame emperors to take away the lives of other men; does not plunder
other men’s goods; does not go on to murder men whom it has spoiled."</p>
<p>174. Augustin answered: How often must I tell you the same thing? If you do not prove
these charges, they tell against no one in the world; and if you prove them, they have no
bearing upon us; just as those things have no bearing upon you which are daily done by the
furious deeds of the insane, by the luxury of the drunken, by the blindness of the suicides,
by the tyranny of robbers. For who can fail to see that what I say is true? But now if charity
were in you, it would rejoice in the truth. For how neatly it is said under covering of the
sheep’s clothing, "Charity beareth all things, endureth all things!" but when you come to the
test, the wolf’s teeth cannot be concealed. For when, in obedience to the words of Scripture,
"forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace,"2186 charity would compel you, even if you knew of any evils within the Church, I
do not say to consent to them, but yet to tolerate them if you could not prevent them, lest,
on account of the wicked who are to be separated by the winnowing-fan at the last day, you
should at the present time sever the bond of peace by breaking off from the society of good
men, you, resisting her influence, and being cast out by the wind of levity, charge the wheat
with being chaff, and declare that what you invent of the wicked holds good through the
force of contagion even in the righteous. And when the Lord has said, "The field is the
world, the harvest is the end of the world," though He said of the wheat and of the tares,
"Let both grow together until the harvest,"2187 you endeavor by your words to bring about
a belief that the wheat has perished throughout the main portion of the field, and only
continued to exist in your little corner,—being desirous that Christ should be proved a liar,
but you the man of truth. And you speak, indeed, against your own conscience; for no one
who in any way looks truly at the gospel will venture in his heart to say that in all the many
nations throughout which is heard the response of Amen, and among whom Alleluia is
sung almost with one single voice, no Christians are to be found. And yet, that it may not
appear that the party of Donatus, which does not communicate with the several nations of
the world, is involved in error, if any angel from heaven, who could see the whole world,
were to declare that outside your communion good and innocent men were nowhere to be

boast of having told the truth before you had received assurance of it. How then is there in
you that charity which rejoices not in iniquity? But be not deceived. Throughout the field,
that is, throughout the world, there will be found the wheat of the Lord growing till the end
of the world. Christ has said this: Christ is truth. Let charity be in you, and let it rejoice in
the truth. Though an angel from heaven preach unto you another gospel contrary to His

<p>177. Petilianus said: "But I answer you, on the other hand, that Jesus
Christ never persecuted any one. And when the apostle found fault with certain parties,
and suggested that He should have recourse to persecution (He Himself having come to
create faith by inviting men to Him, rather than by compelling them), those apostles say,
‘Many lay on hands in Thy name, and are not with us:’ but Jesus said, ‘Let them alone; if
they are not against you, they are on your side.’"</p>
<p>178. Augustin answered: You say truly that you will bring forth out of your store with
greater abundance things which are not written in the Scriptures. For if you wish to bring
forth proofs from holy Scripture, will you bring forth even those which you cannot find
therein? But it is in your own power to multiply your lies according to your will. For where
is what you quoted written? or when was that either suggested to our Lord, or answered by
our Lord? "Many lay on hands in Thy name, and are not with us," are words that no one
of the disciples ever uttered to the Son of God; and therefore neither could the answer have
been made by Him, "Let them alone: if they are not against you, they are on your side." But
there is something somewhat like it which we really do read in the gospel,—that a suggestion
was made to the Lord about a certain man who was casting out devils in His name, but did
not follow Him with His disciples; and in that case the Lord does say, "Forbid him not: for
he that is not against us is for us."2190 But this has nothing to do with pointing out parties
whom the Lord is supposed to have spared. And if you have been deceived by an apparent
resemblance of sentiment, this is not a lie, but merely human infirmity. But if you wished
to cast a mist of falsehood over those who are unskilled in holy Scripture, then may you be
pricked to the heart, and covered with confusion and corrected. Yet there is a point which
we would urge in respect of this very man of whom the suggestion was made to our Lord.
For even as at that time, beyond the communion of the disciples, the holiness of Christ was
yet of the greatest efficacy, even so now, beyond the communion of the Church, the holiness
of the sacraments is of avail. For neither is baptism consecrated save in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. But who will be so utterly insane as to declare
that the name of the Son may be of avail even beyond the communion of the Church, but
that this is not possible with the names of the Father and of the Holy Ghost? or that it may
be of avail in healing a man, but not in consecrating baptism? But it is manifest that outside
the communion of the Church, and the most holy bond of unity, and the most excellent gift
of charity, neither he by whom the devil is cast out nor he who is baptized obtains eternal
life; just as those do not obtain it, who through communion in the sacraments seem indeed
to be within, and through the depravity of their character are understood to be without.
But that Christ persecuted even with bodily chastisement those whom He drove with scourges
from the temple, we have already said above.</p>

<p>179. Petilianus said: "But the holy apostle said this: ‘In any way, whatsoever
it may be,’ he says, ‘let Christ be preached.’"</p>
<p>180. Augustin answered: You speak against yourself; but yet, since you speak on the
side of truth, if you love it, let what you say be counted for you. For I ask of you of whom
it was that the Apostle Paul said this? Let us, if you please, trace this a little further back.
"Some," he says, "preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will, some of
love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel. But some indeed preach Christ
even of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds. What then?
notwithstanding every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein
do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice."2191 We see that they preached what was in itself holy, and
pure, and true, but yet not in a pure manner, but of envy and contention, without charity,
without purity. Certainty a short time ago you appeared to be urging the praises of charity
as against us, according to the witness of the apostle, that where there is no charity, whatever
there is is of no avail; and yet you see that in those there is no charity, and there was with
them the preaching of Christ, of which the apostle says here that he rejoices. For it is not
that he rejoices in what is evil in them, but in what is good in the name of Jesus Christ. In
him assuredly there was the charity which "rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the
truth."2192 The envy, moreover, which was in them is an evil proceeding from the devil,
for by this he has both killed and cast down. Where then were these wicked men whom the
apostle thus condemns, and in whom there was so much that was good to cause him to rejoice?
Were they within, or without? Choose which you will. If they were within, then Paul
knew them, and yet they did not pollute him. And so you would not be polluted in the unity
of the whole world by those of whom you make certain charges, whether these be true, or
falsehoods invented by yourselves. Wherefore do you separate yourself? Why do you destroy
yourself by the criminal sacrilege of schism? But if they were without, then you see that
even in those who were without, and who certainly cannot belong to everlasting life, since
they have not charity, and do not abide in unity, there is yet found the holiness of the name
of Christ, so that the apostle joyfully confirms their teaching, on account of the intrinsic
holiness of the name, although he repudiates them. We are right, therefore, in not doing
wrong to the actual name, when those come to us who were without; but we correct the individuals,
while we do honor to the name. Do you therefore take heed, and see how wickedly
you act in the case of those whose acts as it seems you condemn, by treating as naught the
sacrament of the name of Christ, which is holy in them. And you, indeed, as is shown by
your words, think that those men of whom the apostle spoke were outside the limits of the
Church. Therefore, when you fear persecution from the Catholics, of which you speak in

<p>181. Petilianus said: "If then there are not some to whom all this power
of faith is found to be in opposition, on what principle do you persecute, so as to compel
men to defile themselves:?"</p>
<p>182. Augustin answered: We neither persecute you, except so far as truth persecutes
falsehood; nor has it anything to do with us if any one has persecuted you in other ways,
just as it has nothing to do with you if any of your party do likewise; nor do we compel you
to defile yourselves, but we persuade you to be cured.</p>

<head>Chapter 84.</head>
<p>183. Petilianus said: "But if authority had been given by some law for
persons to be compelled to what is good, you yourselves, unhappy men, ought to have been
compelled by us to embrace the purest faith. But far be it, far be it from our conscience to
compel any one to embrace our faith."</p>
<p>184. Augustin answered: No one is indeed to be compelled to embrace the faith against
his will; but by the severity, or one might rather say, by the mercy of God, it is common for
treachery to be chastised with the scourge of tribulation. Is it the case, because the best
morals are chosen by freedom of will, that therefore the worst morals are not punished by
integrity of law? But yet discipline to punish an evil manner of living is out of the question,
except where principles of good living which had been learned have come to be despised.
If any laws, therefore, have been enacted against you, you are not thereby forced to do well,
but are only prevented from doing ill.2193 For no one can do well unless he has deliberately
chosen, and unless he has loved what is in free will; but the fear of punishment, even if it
does not share in the pleasures of a good conscience, at any rate keeps the evil desire from
escaping beyond the bounds of thought. Who are they, however, that have enacted adverse
laws by which your audacity could be repressed? Are they not those of whom the apostle
says that "they bear not the sword in vain; for they are the ministers of God, revengers to
execute wrath upon them that do evil?"2194 The whole question therefore is, whether you
are not doing ill, who are charged by the whole world with the sacrilege of so great a schism.
And yet, neglecting the discussion of this question, you talk on irrelevant matters; and while
you live as robbers, you boast that you die as martyrs.2195 And, through fear either of the
laws themselves, or of the odium which you might incur, or else because you are unequal
to the task of resisting, I do not say so many men, but so many Catholic nations, you even
glory in your gentleness, that you do not compel any to join your party. According to your
way of talking, the hawk, when he has been prevented by flight from carrying off the fowls,
might call himself a dove. For when have you ever had the power without using it? And
hence you show how you would do more if you only could. When Julian, envying the peace
of Christ, restored to you the churches which belonged to unity, who could tell of all the
massacres which were committed by you, when the very devils rejoiced with you at the
opening of their temples? In the war with Firmus and his party, let Mauritania Cæsariensis
itself be asked to tell us what the Moor Rogatus2196 suffered at your hands. In the time of

<note type="footnote">2195 Augustin speaks of the Moor Rogatus, bishop of Cartenna in ecclesiastical province of Mauritania
Cæsariensis in his ninety-third epistle, to Vincentius, c. iii. 11. We learn from the eighty-seventh epistle, to
Emeritus, sec. 10, that the followers of Rogatus called the other Donatists Firmiani, because they had been subjected
to much cruelty at their hands under the authority of Firmus.</note>

Gildo, because one of your colleagues2197 was his intimate friend, let the followers of Maximianus
be our witnesses to their sufferings. For if one might appeal to Felicianus himself,
who is now with you, on his oath, whether Optatus did not compel him against his will to
return to your communion, he would not dare to open his lips, especially if the people of
Musti could behold his face, who were witnesses to everything that was done. But let them,
as I have said, be witnesses to what they have suffered at the hands of those with whom they
acted in such wise towards Rogatus. The Catholic Church herself, though strengthened by
the assistance of Catholic princes ruling by land and sea, was savagely attacked by hostile
troops in arms under Optatus. It was this that first made it necessary to urge before the
vicar Seranus that the law should be put in force against you which imposes a fine of ten
pounds of gold, which none of you have ever paid to this very day, and yet you charge us
with cruelty. But where could you find a milder course of proceeding, than that crimes of
such magnitude on your part should be punished by the imposition of a pecuniary fine?
Or who could enumerate all the deeds which you commit in the places which you hold, of
your own sovereign will and pleasure, each one as he can, without any friendship on the
part of judges or any others in authority? Who is there of our party, among the inhabitants
of our towns, who has not either learned something of this sort from those who came before
him, or experienced it for himself? Is it not the case that at Hippo, where I am, there are
not wanting some who remember that your leader Faustinus gave orders, in the time of his
supreme power, in consequence of the scanty numbers of the Catholics in the place, that
no one should bake their bread for them, insomuch that a baker, who was the tenant of one
of our deacons, threw away the bread of his landlord unbaked, and though he was not sentenced
to exile under any law, he cut him off from all share in the necessaries of life not only
in a Roman state,2198 but even in his own country, and not only in his own country, but in
his own house? Why, even lately, as I myself recall with mourning to this day, did not
Crispinus of Calama, one of your party, having bought a property, and that only copyhold,
2199 boldly and unhesitatingly immerse in the waters of a second baptism no less than
eighty souls, murmuring with miserable groans under the sole influence of terror; and this
in a farm belonging to the Catholic emperors, by whose laws you were forbidden even to
be in any Roman city?2200 But what else was it, save such deeds as these of yours, that made

it necessary for the very laws to be passed of which you complain? The laws, indeed, are
very far from being proportionate to your offenses; but, such as they are, you may thank
yourselves for their existence. Indeed, should we not certainly be driven on all sides from
the country by the furious attacks of your Circumcelliones, who fight under your command
in furious troops, unless we held you as hostages in the towns, who might well be unwilling
to endure under any circumstances the mere gaze of the people, and the censure of all
honorable men. from very shame, if not from fear? Do not therefore say, "Far be it, far be
it from our conscience, to force any one to embrace our faith." For you do it when you can;
and when you do not do it, it is because you are unable, either from fear of the laws or the
odium which would accompany it, or because of the numbers of those who would resist.</p>

<p>185. Petilianus said: "For the Lord Christ says, ‘No man can come to me,
except the Father which hath sent me draw him.’2201 But why do we not permit each several
person to follow his free will, since the Lord God Himself has given free will to men, showing
to them, however, the way of righteousness, lest any one by chance should perish from ignorance
of it? For He said, ‘I have placed before thee good and evil. I have set fire and water
before thee; choose which thou wilt.’ From which choice, you wretched men, you have
chosen for yourselves not water, but rather fire. ‘But yet,’ He says, ‘choose the good, that
thou mayest live.’2202 You who will not choose the good, have, by your own sentence, declared
that you do not wish to live."</p>
<p>186. Augustin answered: If I were to propose to you the question how God the Father
draws men to the Son, when He has left them to themselves in freedom of action, you would
perhaps find it difficult of solution. For how does He draw them to Him if He leaves them
to themselves, so that each should choose what he pleases? And yet both these facts are
true; but this is a truth which few have intellect enough to penetrate. As therefore it is possible
that, after leaving men to themselves in free will, the Father should yet draw them to the
Son, so is it also possible that those warnings which are given by the correction of the laws
do not take away free will. For whenever a man suffers anything that is harsh and unpleasing,
he is warned to consider why it is that he is suffering, so that, if he shall discover that he is
suffering in the cause of justice, he may choose the good that consists in the very act of suffering
as he does in the cause of justice; but if he sees that it is unrighteousness for which
he suffers, he may be induced, from the consideration that he is suffering and being tormented
most fruitlessly, to change his purpose for the better, and may at the same time escape
both the fruitless annoyance and the unrighteousness itself, which is likely to prove yet more
hurtful and pernicious in the mischief it produces. And so you, when kings make any enactments
against you, should consider that you are receiving a warning to consider why this
is being done to you. For if it is for righteousness’ sake, then are they truly your persecutors;
but you are the blessed ones, who, being persecuted for righteousness’ sake, shall inherit
the kingdom of heaven:2203 but if it is because of the iniquity of your schism, what are they
more than your correctors; while you, like all the others who are guilty of various crimes,
and pay the penalty appointed by the law, are undoubtedly unhappy both in this world and
in that which is to come? No one, therefore, takes away from you your free will. But I would
urge you diligently to consider which you would rather choose,—whether to live corrected
in peace, or, by persevering in malice, to undergo real punishment under the false name of
martyrdom. But I am addressing you just as though you were suffering something propor-

tionate to your sin, whereas you are committing sins of such enormity and reigning in such
impunity. You are so furious, that you cause more terror than a war trumpet with your cry
of "Praise to God;" so full of calumny, that even when you throw yourselves over precipices
without any provocation, you impute it to our persecutions.</p>
<p>187. He says also, like the kindest of teachers, "You who will not choose the good, have,
by your own sentence, declared that you do not wish to live." According to this, if we were
to believe your accusations, we should live in kindness; but because we believe the promises
of God, we declare by our own sentence that we do not wish to live. You remember well,
it seems to me, what the apostles answered to the Jews when they were desired to abstain
from preaching Christ. This therefore we also say, that you should answer us whether we
ought rather to obey God or man.2204 Traditors, offerers of incense, persecutors: these are
the words of men against men. Christ remained only in the love of Donatus: these are the
words of men extolling the glory of a man under the name of Christ, that the glory of Christ
Himself may be diminished. For it is written, "In the multitude of people is the king’s honor:
but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince:"2205 these, therefore, are the words
of men. But those words in the gospel, "It behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the
dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His
name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem,"2206 are the words of Christ, showing forth
the glory which He received from His Father in the wideness of His kingdom. When we
have heard them both, we choose in preference the communion of the Church, and prefer
the words of Christ to the words of men. I ask, who is there that can say that we have chosen
what is evil, except one who shall say that Christ taught what was evil?</p>

even of schismatics? and if He were to issue such an order at all, you ought to be slain by
some barbarians and Scythians, not by Christians."</p>
<p>189. Augustin answered: Let your Circumcelliones remain quiet, and let me entreat
you not to terrify us about barbarians. But as to whether we or you are schismatics, let the
question be put neither to you nor to me, but to Christ, that He may show where His Church
is to be found. Read the gospel then, and there you find the answer, "In Jerusalem, and in
all Judea, and in Samaria and even in the whole earth."2207 If any one, therefore, is not
found within the Church, let not any further question be put to him, but let him either be
corrected or converted, or else, being detected, let him not complain.</p>

<p>190. Petilianus said: "For neither has the Lord God at any time rejoiced
in human blood, seeing that He was even willing that Cain, the murderer of his brother,
should continue to exist in his murderer’s life."</p>
<p>191. Augustin answered: If God was unwilling that death should be inflicted on him
who slew his brother, preferring that he should continue to exist in his murderer’s life, see
whether this be not the cause why, seeing that the heart of the king is in the hand of God,
whereby he has himself enacted many laws for your correction and reproof, yet no law of
the king has commanded that you should be put to death, perhaps with this very object,
that any one of you who persists in the obstinate self-will of his sacrilegious madness should
be tortured with the punishment of the fratricide Cain, that is to say, with the life of a murderer.
For we read that many were slain in mercy by Moses the servant of the Lord; for in
that he prayed thus in intercession to the Lord for their wicked sacrilege, saying, "O Lord,
if Thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book which Thou
hast written," 2208 his unspeakable charity and mercy are plainly shown. Could it be, then,
that he was suddenly changed to cruelty, when, on descending from the mount, he ordered
so many thousands to be slain? Consider, therefore, whether it may not be a sign of greater
anger on the part of God, that, whilst so many laws have been enacted against you, you have
not been ordered by any emperor to be put to death. Or do you think that you are not to
be compared to that fratricide? Hearken to the Lord speaking through His prophet: "From
the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among
the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering;
for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts."2209 On this brother’s
sacrifice you show that you look with malignant eyes, over and above the respect which God
pays to it; and if ye have ever heard that "from the rising of the sun, unto the going down
of the same, the Lord’s name is to be praised,"2210 which is that living sacrifice of which it
is said, "Offer unto God thanksgiving,"2211 then will your countenance fall like that of yonder
murderer. But inasmuch as you cannot kill the whole world, you are involved in the same
guilt by your mere hatred, according to the words of John, "Whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer."2212 And I would that any innocent brother might rather fall into the hands
of your Circumcelliones, to be murdered by their weapons, than be subjected to the poison
of your tongue and rebaptized.</p>

<p>192. Petilianus said: "We advise you, therefore, if so be that you will hear
it willingly, and even though you do not willingly receive it, yet we warn you that the Lord
Christ instituted for Christians, not any form of slaying, but one of dying only. For if He
loved men who thus delight in battle, He would not have consented to be slain for us."</p>
<p>193. Augustin answered: Would that your martyrs would follow the form that He
prescribed! they would not throw themselves over precipices, which He refused to do at the
bidding of the devil.2213 But when you persecute our ancestors with false witness even now
that they are dead, whence have you received this form? In that you endeavor to stain us
with the crimes of men we never knew, while you are unwilling that the most notorious
misdeeds of your own party should be reckoned against you, whence have you received this
form? But we are too much yielding to our own conceit if we find fault about ourselves,
when we see that you utter false testimony against the Lord Himself, since He Himself both
promised and made manifest that His Church should extend throughout all nations, and
you maintain the contrary. This form, therefore, you did not receive even from the Jewish
persecutors themselves, for they persecuted His body while He was walking on the earth:
you persecute His gospel as He is seated in heaven. Which gospel endured more meekly
the flames of furious kings than it can possibly endure your tongues; for while they blazed,
unity remained, and this it cannot do amid your words. They who desired that the word
of God should perish in the flames did not believe that it could be despised if read. They
would not, therefore, set their flames to work upon the gospel, if you would let them use
your tongues against the gospel. In the earlier persecution the gospel of Christ was sought
by some in their rage, it was betrayed by others in their fear; it was burned by some in their
rage, it was hidden by others in their love; it was attacked, but none were found to speak
against its truth. The more accursed share of persecution was reserved for you when the
persecution of the heathen was exhausted. Those who persecuted the name of Christ believed
in Christ: now those who are honored for the name of Christ are found to speak against
His truth.</p>

<p>194. Petilianus said: "Here you have the fullest possible proof that a
Christian may take no part in the destruction of another. But the first establishing of this
principle was in the case of Peter, as it is written, ‘Simon Peter having a sword, drew it, and
smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up
thy sword into the sheath. For all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.’"2214</p>
<p>195. Augustin answered: Why then do you not restrain the weapons of the Circumcelliones
with such words as these? Should you think that you were going beyond the words
of the gospel if you should say, All they that take the cudgel shall perish with the cudgel?
Withhold not then your pardon, if our ancestors were unable to restrain the men by whom
you complain that Marculus was thrown down a precipice; for neither is it written in the
gospel, He that useth to throw men down a precipice shall be cast therefrom. And would
that, as your charges are either false or out of date, so the cudgels of those friends of yours
would cease! And yet, perhaps, you take it ill that, if not by force of law, at any rate in words,
we take away their armor from your legions in saying that they manifest their rage with
sticks alone. For that was the ancient fashion of their wickedness, but now they have advanced
too far. For amid their drunken revellings, and amid the free license of assembling
together, wandering in the streets, jesting, drinking, passing the whole night in company
with women who have no husbands, they have learned not only to brandish cudgels, but to
wield swords and whirl slings. But why should I not say to them (God knows with what
feelings I say it and with what feelings they receive it!), Madmen, the sword of Peter, though
drawn from motives not yet free from fleshly impurity, was yet drawn in defence of the body
of Christ against the body of His persecutor, but your arms are portioned out against the
cause of Christ; but the body of which He is the head, that is, His Church, extends
throughout all nations. He Himself has said this, and has ascended into heaven, whither
the fury of the Jews could not follow Him; and it is your fury which attacks His members
in the body, which on His ascension He commended to our care. In defense of those
members all men rage against you, all men resist you, as many as being in the Catholic
Church, and possessing as yet but little faith, are influenced by the same motives as Peter
was when he drew his sword in the name of Christ. But there is a great difference between
your persecution and theirs. You are like the servant of the Jews’ high priest; for in the
service of your princes you arm yourselves against the Catholic Church, that is, against the
body of Christ. But they are such as Peter then was, fighting even with the strength of their
bodies for the body of Christ, that is, the Church. But if they are bidden to be still, as Peter
then was bidden, how much more should you be warned that, laying aside the madness of
heresy, you should join the unity of those members for which they so fight? But, being
wounded by such men as these, you hate us also; and, as though you had lost your right

ears, you do not hear the voice of Christ as He sits at the right hand of the Father. But to
whom shall I address myself, or how shall I address myself to them, seeing that in them I
find no time wherein to speak? for even early in the morning they are reeking with wine,
drunk, it may be already in the day, it may be still from overnight. Moreover, they utter
threats, and not they only, but their own bishops utter threats concerning them, being ready
to deny that what they have done has any bearing on them. May the Lord grant to us a song
of degrees, in which we may say, "When I am with those who hate peace, I am peaceful.
When I would speak with them, they are wont to fight me without cause."2215 For thus says
the body of Christ, which throughout the whole world is assailed by heretics, by some here,
by others there, and by all alike wherever they may be.2216</p>

<p>196. Petilianus said: "Therefore I say, He ordained that we should undergo
death for the faith, which each man should do for the communion of the Church. For
Christianity makes progress by the deaths of its followers. For if death were feared by the
faithful, no man would be found to live with perfect faith. For the Lord Christ says, ‘Except
a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth
much fruit.’"2217</p>
<p>197. Augustin answered: I should be glad to know which of your party it was who first
threw himself over a precipice. For truly that grain of corn was fruitful from which so great
a crop of similar suicides has sprung. Tell me, when you make mention of the words of the
Lord, that He says a grain of wheat shall die and bring forth much fruit, why do you envy
the real fruit, which has most truly2218 sprung up throughout the whole world, and bring
up against it all the charges of the tares or chaff which you have ever either heard of or invented?</p>

prisons more frequent, in deaths oft’?2220 He makes mention of the sufferings which he
underwent, not of the deeds which he performed. It had been enough for the Christian
faith that these things should be done by the Jews: why do you, wretched men, do these

<p>202. Petilianus said: "But what have you to do with the kings of this
world, in whom Christianity has never found anything save envy towards her? And to teach
you shortly the truth of what I say, A king persecuted the brethren of the Maccabees.2222
A king also condemned the three children to the sanctifying flames, being ignorant what
he did, seeing that he himself was fighting against God.2223 A king sought the life of the
infant Saviour.2224 A king exposed Daniel, as he thought, to be eaten by wild beasts.2225
And the Lord Christ Himself was slain by a king’s most wicked judge.2226 Hence it is that
the apostle cries out, ‘We speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom
of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: but we speak the wisdom
of God in a mystery, which was hidden, which God ordained before the world unto our
glory; which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not
have crucified the Lord of glory.’2227 But grant that this was said of the heathen kings of
old. Yet you, rulers of this present age, because you desire to be Christians, do not allow
men to be Christians, seeing that, when they are believing in all honesty of heart, you draw
them by the defilement and mist of your falsehood wholly over to your wickedness, that
with their arms, which were provided against the enemies of the state, they should assail
the Christians, and should think that, at your instigation, they are doing the work of Christ
if they kill us whom you hate, according to the saying of the Lord Christ: ‘The time cometh,’
He says, ‘that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.’2228 It makes no
matter therefore to you, false teachers, whether the kings of this world desire to be heathens,
which God forbid, or Christians, so long as you cease not in your efforts to arm them against
the family of Christ. But do you not know, or rather, have you not read, that the guilt of
one who instigates a murder is greater than the guilt of him who carries it out? Jezebel had
excited the king her husband to the murder of a poor and righteous man, yet husband and
wife alike perished by an equal punishment.2229 Nor indeed is your mode of urging on
kings different from that by which the subtle persuasion of women has often urged kings
on to guilt. For the wife of Herod earned and obtained the boon by means of her daughter,
that the head of John should be brought to table in a charger.2230 Similarly the Jews forced

on Pontius Pilate that he should crucify the Lord Jesus, whose blood Pilate prayed might
remain in vengeance upon them and on their children.2231 So therefore you also overwhelm
yourselves with our blood by your sin. For it does not follow that because it is the hand of
the judge that strikes the blow, your calumnies therefore are not rather guilty of the deed.
For the prophet David says, speaking in the person of Christ, ‘Why do the heathen rage,
and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers
take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His Anointed, saying, Let us break their
bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh:
the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath, and vex
them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare
the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee.
Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts
of the earth for Thy possession. Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash
them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ And he warned the kings themselves in the following
precepts, that they should not, like ignorant men devoid of understanding, seek to persecute
the Christians, lest they should themselves be destroyed,—which precepts I would that we
could teach them, seeing that they are ignorant of them; or, at least, that you would show
them to them, as doubtless you would do if you desired that they should live; or, at any rate,
if neither of the other courses be allowed, that your malice would have permitted them to
read them for themselves. The first Psalm of David would certainly have persuaded them
that they should live and reign as Christians; but meanwhile you deceive them, so long as
they entrust themselves to you. For you represent to them things that are evil, and you hide
from them what is good. Let them then at length read this, which they should have read
already long ago. For what does he say, ‘Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed,
ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Lay hold of
instruction lest the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the right way. Since how quickly has
His wrath kindled over you? Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.’2232 You urge
on emperors, I say, with your persuasions, even as Pilate, whom, as we showed above, the
Jews urged on, though he himself cried aloud, as he washed his hands before them all, ‘I am
innocent of the blood of this just person,’2233—as though a person could be clear from the
guilt of a sin who had himself committed it. But, to say nothing of ancient examples, observe,
from instances taken from your own party, how very many of your emperors and judges
have perished in persecuting us. To pass over Nero, who was the first to persecute the

Christians, Domitian perished almost in the same way as Nero, as also did Trajan, Geta,2234
Decius, Valerian, Diocletian; Maximian also perished, at whose command that men should
burn incense to their gods, burning the sacred volumes, Marcellinus indeed first, but after
him also Mensurius of Carthage, and Cæcilianus, escaped death from the sacrilegious flames,
surviving like some ashes or cinders from the burning. For the consciousness of the guilt
of burning incense involved you all, as many as agreed with Mensurius. Macarius perished,
Ursacius 2235 perished, and all your counts perished in like manner by the vengeance of
God. For Ursacius was slain in a battle with the barbarians, after which birds of prey with
their savage talons, and the greedy teeth of dogs with their biting, tore him limb from limb.
Was not he too a murderer at your suggestion, who, like king Ahab, whom we showed to
have been persuaded by a woman, slew a poor and righteous man?2236 So you too do not
cease to murder us, who are just and poor (poor, that is, in worldly wealth; for in the grace
of God no one of us is poor). For even if you do not murder a man with your hands, you
do not cease to do so with your butcherous tongues. For it is written, ‘Death and life are in
the power of the tongue.’2237 All, therefore, who have been murdered, you, the instigator
of the deed, have slain. Nor indeed does the hand of the butcher glow save at the instigation
of your tongue; and that terrible heat of the breast is inflamed by your words to take the
blood of others,—blood that shall take a just vengeance upon him who shed it."</p>
<p>203. Augustin answered: If I were to answer adequately, and as I ought, to this passage,
which has been exaggerated and arranged at such length by you, where you speak in invidious
terms against us concerning the kings of this world, I am much afraid that you would accuse
me too of having wished to excite the anger of kings against you. And yet, whilst you are
borne after your own fashion by the violence of this invective against all Catholics, you

against himself: "But so soon as Silvanus, bishop of Cirta, had refused to communicate with Ursacius and Zenophilus
the persecutors, he was driven into exile." Usuardus, deceived by a false story made up by the Donatists,
enters in his Martyrology, that a pseudo-martyr Donatus suffered on the 1st of March, under Ursacius and
Marcellinus, to this effect: "On the same day of the holy martyr Donatus, who suffered under Ursacius the judge
(or dux), and the tribune Marcellinus."</note>

certainly do not pass me by. I will endeavor, however, to show, if I can, that it is rather you
who have been guilty of this offense by speaking as you have done, than myself by answering
as I shall do. And first of all, see how you yourself oppose your self; for certainly you prefaced
the passage which you quoted with the words, "What have you to do with the kings of this
world, in whom Christianity has never found anything save envy towards her?" In these
words you certainly cut off from us all access to the kings of this world. And a little later
you say, "And he warned the kings themselves in the following precepts, that they should
not, like ignorant men devoid of understanding, seek to persecute the Christians, lest they
should be themselves destroyed,—which precepts I would that we could teach them, seeing
that they are ignorant of them; or, at least, that you would show them to them, as doubtless
you would do if you desired that they should live." In what way then do you wish us to be
the instructors of kings? And indeed those of our body who have any friendship with
Christian kings commit no sin if they make a right use of that friendship; but if any are
elated by it, they yet sin far less grievously than you. For what had you, who thus reproach
us,—what had you to do with a heathen king, and what is worse, with Julian, the apostate
and enemy of the name of Christ, to whom, when you were begging that the basilicas should
be restored to you as though they were your own, you ascribed this meed of praise, "that in
him justice alone was found to have a place"?—in which words (for I believe that you understand
the Latin tongue) both the idolatry and the apostasy of Julian are styled justice. I hold
in my hands the petition which your ancestors presented; the memorial2238 which embodied
their request; the chronicles, where they made their representation. Watch and attend. To
the enemy of Christ, to the apostate, the antagonist of Christians, the servant of the devil,
that friend, that representative, that Pontius of yours, made supplication in such words as
these: "Go to then, and say to us, What have you to do with the kings of this world?" that
as deaf men you may read to the deaf nations what you as well as they refuse to hear;" Thou
beholdest the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine
own eye."2239</p>
<p>204. "What," say you, "have you to do with the kings of this world, in whom Christianity
has never found anything save envy towards her?" Having said this, you endeavored to
reckon up what kings the righteous had found to be their enemies, and did not consider
how many more might be enumerated who have proved their friends. The patriarch Abraham
was both most friendly treated, and presented with a token of friendship, by a king
who had been warned from heaven not to defile his wife.2240 Isaac his son likewise found

a king most friendly to him.2241 Jacob, being received with honor by a king in Egypt, went
so far as to bless him.2242 What shall I say of his son Joseph, who, after the tribulation of a
prison, in which his chastity was tried as gold is tried in the fire, being raised by Pharaoh to
great honors,2243 even swore by the life of Pharaoh,2244—not as though puffed up with vain
conceit, but being not unmindful of his kindness. The daughter of a king adopted Moses.2245
David took refuge with a king of another race, compelled thereto by the unrighteousness
of the king of Israel.2246 Elijah ran before the chariot of a most wicked king,—not by the
king’s command, but from his own loyalty.2247 Elisha thought it good to offer of his own
accord to the woman who had sheltered him anything that she might wish to have obtained
from the king through his intercession.2248 But I will come to the actual times when the
people of God were in captivity, in which, to use a mild expression, a strange forgetfulness
came over you. For, wishing to prove that Christianity has never found anything in kings
saving envy towards her, you made mention of the three children and Daniel, who suffered
at the hands of persecuting kings, and you could not derive instruction from circumstances
not occurring near, but in the very same passages, viz., from the conduct of the king himself
after the miracle of the flames which did no hurt, whether as shown in praising and setting
forth the name of God, or in honoring the three children themselves, or from the esteem in
which the king held Daniel, and the gifts with which he honored him, nothing loth to receive
them, when he, rendering the honor that was due to the king’s power, as sufficiently appears
from his own words, did not hesitate to use the gift with which he was endowed by God, in
interpreting the king’s dream. And when, in consequence, the king was compelled by the
men who envied the holy prophet, and heaped calumnies upon him with sacrilegious
madness, most unwillingly to cast him into the den of lions, sadly though he did it, yet he
had the conviction that he would be safe through the help and protection of his God. Accordingly,
when Daniel, by the miraculous repression of the lions’ rage, had been preserved
unhurt, when the friendly voice of the king spoke first to him, in accents of anxiety, he
himself replied with benediction from the den, "O king, live for ever!"2249 How came it that,
when your argument was turning on the very same subject, when you were yourself quoting

the examples of the servants of God in whose case these things were done, you either failed
to see, or were unwilling to see, or seeing and knowing, were silent, in a manner which I
know not how you will defend, about those instances of friendship felt by kings for the
saints? But if it were not that, as a defender of the basest cause, you are hindered by the
desire of building up falsehood, and thereby turned away either as unwilling or as ignorant
from the light of truth, there can be no doubt that you could, without any difficulty, recall
some good kings as well as some bad ones, and some friendly to the saints as well as some
unfriendly. And we cannot but wonder that your Circumcelliones thus throw themselves
from precipices. Who was running after you, I pray? What Macarius, what soldier was
pursuing you? Certainly none of our party thrust you into this abyss of falsehood. Why
then did you thus run headlong with your eyes shut, so that when you said, "What have you
to do with the kings of this world?" you did not add, In whom Christianity has often found
envy towards herself, instead of boldly venturing to say, "In whom Christianity has never
found anything save envy towards her?" Was it really true that you neither thought yourself,
nor considered that those who read your writings would think, how many instances of kings
there were that went against your views? Does he not know what he says?</p>
<p>205. Or do you think that, because those whom I have mentioned belonged to olden
times, therefore they form no argument against you, because you did not say, In whom
righteousness has never found anything save envy towards her, but "In whom Christianity
has never found anything saving envy towards her,"—meaning, perhaps, that it should be
understood that they began to show envy towards the righteous from the time when they
began to bear the name of Christians? What then is the meaning of those examples from
olden times, by which you even more imprudently wished to prove what you had so imprudently
ventured to assert? For was it not before Christ was born in the world that the
Maccabees, and the three children, and Daniel, did and suffered what you told of them?
And again, why was it, as I asked just now, that you offered a petition to Julian, the undoubted
foe of Christianity? Why did you seek to recover the basilicas from him? Why did you declare
that only righteousness found a place with him? If it is the foe of Christianity that
hears such things as these, what then are they from whom he hears them? But it should be
observed that Constantine, who was certainly no foe to the name of Christian, but rather
rendered glorious by it, being mindful of the hope which he maintained in Christ, and deciding
most justly on behalf of His unity, was not worthy to be acknowledged by you, even
when you yourselves appealed to him. Both these were emperors in Christian times, but
yet not both of them were Christians. But if both of them were foes of Christianity, why
did you thus appeal to one of them? why did you thus present a petition to the other? For
on your ancestors making their petition, Constantine had given an episcopal judgment both
at Rome and at Arles; and yet the first of them you accused before him, from the other you
appealed to him. But if, as is the case, one of them had believed in Christ, the other had

<pb n="1151"/>
apostatized from Christ, why is the Christian despised while furthering the interests of unity,
the apostate praised while favoring deceit? Constantine ordered that the basilicas should
be taken from you, Julian that they should be restored. Do you wish to know which of these
actions is conducive to Christian peace? The one was done by a man who had believed in
Christ, the other by one who had abandoned Christ. O how you would wish that you could
say, It was indeed ill done that supplication should so be made to Julian, but what has that
to do with us? But if you were to say this, the Catholic Church would also conquer in these
same words, whose saints dispersed throughout the world are much less concerned with
what you say of those towards whom you feel as you may be disposed to feel. But it is beyond
your power to say, It was ill done that supplication should so be made to Julian. Your throat
is closed; your tongue is checked by an authority close at home. It was Pontius that did it.
Pontius presented the petition; Pontius declared that the apostate was most righteous;
Pontius set forth that only righteousness found a place with the apostate. That Pontius
made a petition to him in these words, we have the express evidence of Julian himself,
mentioning him by name, without any disguise. Your representations still exist. It is no
uncertain rumor, but public documents that bear witness to the fact. Can it be, that because
the apostate made some concession to your prayer, to the detriment of the unity of Christ,
you therefore find truth in what was said, that only righteousness found a place with him?
but because Christian emperors decide against your wishes, since this appears to them most
likely to contribute to the unity of Christ, therefore they are called the foes of Christianity?
Such folly may all heretics display; and may they regain wisdom, so that they should be no
longer heretics.</p>
<p>206. And when is that fulfilled, you will say, which the Lord declares, "The time cometh,
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service"?2250 At any rate neither
can this be said of the heathen, who persecuted Christians, not for the sake of God, but for
the sake of their idols. You do not see that if this had been said of these emperors who rejoice
in the name of Christian, their chief command would certainly have been this, that you
should have been put to death; and this command they never gave at all. But the men of
your party, by opposing the laws in hostile fashion, bring deserved punishment on themselves;
and their own voluntary deaths, so long as they think that they bring odium on us, they
consider in no wise ruinous to themselves. But if they think that that saying of Christ refers
to kings who honor the name of Christ, let them ask what the Catholic Church suffered in
the East, when, Valens the Arian was emperor. There indeed I might find what I should
understand to be sufficient fulfillment of the saying of the Lord, "The time cometh, that
whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service," that heretics should not claim,
as conducing to their especial glory, the injunctions issued against their errors by Catholic

emperors. But we remember that that time was fulfilled after the ascension of our Lord, of
which holy Scripture is known by all to be a witness. The Jews thought that they were doing
a service to God when they put the apostles to death. Among those who thought that they
were showing service to God was even our Saul, though not ours as yet; so that among his
causes for confidence which were past and to be forgotten, he enumerates the following:
"An Hebrew," he says, "of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal,
persecuting the Church."2251 Here was one who thought that he did God service when he
did what presently he suffered himself. For forty Jews bound themselves by an oath that
they would slay him, when he caused that this should be made known to the tribune, so that
under the protection of a guard of armed men he escaped their snares.2252 But there was
no one yet to say to him, What have you to do (not with kings, but) with tribunes and the
arms of kings? There was no one to say to him, Dare you seek protection at the hand of
soldiers, when your Lord was dragged by them to undergo His sufferings? There were as
yet no instances of madness such as yours; but there were already examples being prepared,
which should be sufficient for their refutation.</p>
<p>207. Moreover, with what terrible force did you venture to set forth and utter the following:
"But to say nothing of ancient examples, observe, from instances taken from your
own party, how very many of your emperors and judges have perished in persecuting us."
When I read this in your letter, I waited with the most earnest expectation to see what you
were going to say, and whom you were going to enumerate, when, lo and behold! as though
passing them over; you began to quote to me Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Geta, Decius, Valerian,
Diocletian, Maximian. I acknowledge that there were more; but you have altogether forgotten
against whom you are arguing. Were not all of these pagans, persecuting generally the
Christian name on behalf of their idols? Be vigilant, then; for the men whom you mention
were not of our communion. They were persecuting the whole aggregate of unity itself,
from which we as you think, or you, as Christ teaches, have gone forth. But you had proposed
to show that our emperors and judges had perished in consequence of persecuting you. Or
is it that you yourself do not require that we should reckon these, because, in mentioning
them, you passed them over, saying, "To pass over Nero;" and with this reservation did you
mean to run through all the rest? What then was the use of their being quoted, if they had
nothing to do with the matter? But what has it to do with me? I now join with you in
leaving these. Next, let that larger number which you promised to us be produced, unless,
indeed, it may be that they cannot be found, inasmuch as you said that they had perished.</p>
<p>208. For now you go on to make mention of the bishops whom you are wont to accuse
of having delivered up the sacred books, concerning whom we on our part are wont to an-

swer: Either you fail in your proof, and so it concerns no one at all; or you succeed and then
it still has no concern with us. For they have borne their own burden, whether it be good
or bad; and we indeed believe that it was good. But of whatever character it was, yet it was
their own; just as your bad men have borne their own burden, and neither you theirs nor
they yours. But the common and most evil burden of you all is schism. This we have already
often said before. Show us, therefore, not the names of bishops, but the names of our emperors
and judges, who have perished in persecuting you. For this, is what you had proposed,
this is what you had promised, this is what you had caused us most eagerly to expect. "Hear,"
he says, "Macarius perished, Ursacius perished, and all your counts perished in like manner,
by the vengeance of God." You have mentioned only two by name, and neither of them was
emperor. Who would be satisfied with this, I ask? Are you not utterly dissatisfied with
yourself? You promise that you will mention a vast number of emperors and judges of our
party who perished in persecuting you; and then, without a word of emperors, you mention
two who were either judges or counts. For as to what you add, "And all your counts perished
in like manner by the vengeance of God," it has nothing to do with the matter. For on this
principle you might some time ago have closed your argument, without mentioning the
name of any one at all. Why then have you not made mention of our emperors, that is to
say, of emperors of our communion? Were you afraid that you should be indicted for high
treason? Where is the fortitude that marks the Circumcelliones? And further, what do you
mean by introducing those whom you mentioned above in such numbers? They might with
more right say to you, Why did you seek us out? For they did nothing to assist your cause,
and yet you mentioned them by name. What kind of man, then, must you be, who fear to
mention those by name, who, as you say, have perished? At any rate, you might mention
more of the judges and counts, of whom you seem to feel no fear. But yet you stopped at
Macarius and Ursacius. Are these two whom you mention the vast number of whom you
spoke? Are you thinking of the lesson which we learned as boys? For if you were to ask of
me what number two is, singular or plural, what could I answer, except that it was plural?
But even so I am still not without the means of reply. I take away Macarius from your list;
for you certainly have not told us how he perished. Or do you maintain that any one who
persecutes you, unless he be immortal on the face of this earth, is to be deemed when he
dies to have died because of you? What if Constantine had not lived to enjoy so long a reign,
and such prolonged prosperity, who was the first to pass many decrees against your errors?
And what if Julian, who gave you back the basilicas, had not been so speedily snatched away
from life?2253 In that case, when would you make an end of talking such nonsense as you
do, seeing that even now you are unwilling to hold your tongues? And yet neither do we
<note type="footnote">2253 The reign of Constantine lasted about thirty-two years, from 306 to 337 A.D. Julian succeeded Constantius,
and reigned one year and seven months, dying at the age of thirty, in a war against the Persians, in 363 A.D.</note>

<pb n="1154"/>
say that Julian died so soon because he gave back the basilicas to you. For we might be
equally prolix with you in this, but we are unwilling to be equally foolish. Well, then, as I
had begun to say, from these two we will take away Macarius. For when you had mentioned
the names of two, Macarius and Ursacius, you repeated the name of Ursacius with the view
of showing us how he deserved his death; and you said, "For Ursacius was slain in a battle
with the barbarians, after which birds of prey with their savage talons, and the greedy teeth
of dogs with their biting, tore him limb from limb." Whence it is quite clear, since it is your
custom to excite greater odium against us on account of Macarius, insomuch that you call
us not Ursacians but Macarians, that you would have been sure to say by far the most concerning
him, had you been able to say anything of the sort about his death. Of these two,
therefore, when you used the plural number, if you take away Macarius, there remains
Ursacius alone, a proper name of the singular number. Where is therefore the fulfillment
of your threatening and tremendous promise of so many who should support your argument?</p>
<p>209. By this time all men who are in any degree acquainted with the meaning of words
must understand, it seems to me, how ridiculous it is that, when you had said, "Macarius
perished, Ursacius perished, and all your counts perished in like manner, by the vengeance
of God," as though men were calling upon you to prove the fact, whereas, in reality, neither
hearer nor reader was calling on you for anything further whatsoever, you immediately
strung together a long argument in order to prove that all our counts perished in like manner
by the vengeance of God. "For Ursacius," you say, "was slain in a battle with the barbarians,
after which birds of prey with their savage talons, and the greedy teeth of dogs with their
biting, tore him limb from limb." In the same way, any one else, who was similarly ignorant
of the meaning of what he says, might assert that all your bishops perished in prison by the
vengeance of God; and when asked how he could prove this fact, he might at once add, For
Optatus, having been accused of belonging to the company of Gildo, was put to death in a
similar way. Frivolous charges such as these we are compelled to listen to, to consider, to
refute; only we are apprehensive for the weak, lest, from the greater slowness of their intellect,
they should fall speedily into your toils. But Ursacius, of whom you speak, if it be the case
that he lived a good life, and really died as you assert, will receive consolation from the
promise of God, who says, "Surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
every beast will I require it."2254</p>
<p>210. But as to the calumnious charges which you bring against us, saying that by us the
wrath of the kings of the world is excited against you, so long as we do not teach them the
lesson of holy Scripture, but rather suggest our own desire of war, I do not imagine that you
are so absolutely deaf to the eloquence of the sacred books themselves as that you should
not rather fear that they should be acquainted with it. But whether you so will or no, they
<note type="footnote">2254 Gen. ix. 5.</note>

<pb n="1155"/>
gain entrance to the Church; and even if we hold our tongues, they give heed to the readers;
and, to say nothing of the rest, they especially listen with the most marked attention to that
very psalm which you quoted. For you said that we do not teach them, nor, so far as we can
help it, allow them to become acquainted with the words of Scripture: "Be wise now therefore,
O ye kings; be instructed ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with
trembling. Take hold of instruction lest the Lord be angry,2255 etc. Believe that even this
is sung, and that they hear it. But, at any rate, they hear what is written above in the same
psalm, which you, unless I am mistaken, were only unwilling to pass over, for fear you should
be understood to be afraid. They hear therefore this as well "The Lord hath said unto me,
Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen
for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession."2256 On
hearing which, they cannot but marvel that some should be found to speak against this inheritance
of Christ, endeavoring to reduce it to a little corner of the earth; and in their
marvel they perhaps ask, on account of what they hear in what follows, "Serve the Lord with
fear," wherein they can serve Him, in so far as they are kings. For all men ought to serve
God,—in one sense, in virtue of the condition common to them all, in that they are men;
in another sense, in virtue of their several gifts, whereby this man has one function on the
earth, and that man has another. For no man, as a private individual, could command that
idols should be taken from the earth, which it was so long ago foretold should come to
pass.2257 Accordingly, when we take into consideration the social condition of the human
race, we find that kings, in the very fact that they are kings, have a service which they can
render to the Lord in a manner which is impossible for any who have not the power of kings.</p>
<p>211. When, therefore, they think over what you quote, they hear also what you yourself
quoted concerning the three children, and hear it with circumstances of marvellous solemnity.
For that same Scripture is most of all sung in the Church at a time when the very
festal nature of the season excites additional fervor even in those who, during the rest of the
year, are more given to be sluggish. What then do you think must be the feelings of Christian
emperors, when they hear of the three children being cast into the burning fiery furnace
because they were unwilling to consent to the wickedness of worshipping the image of the
king,2258 unless you suppose that they consider that the pious liberty of the saints cannot
be overcome either by the power of kings, or by any enormity of punishment, and that they
rejoice that they are not of the number of those kings who used to punish men that despised

<pb n="1156"/>
idols as though they were guilty of sacrilege? But, further, when they hear in what follows
that the same king, terrified by the marvellous sight of, not only the three children, but the
very flames performing service unto God, himself too began to serve God in fear, and to
rejoice with reverence, and to lay hold of instruction, do they not understand that the reason
that this was recorded, and set forth with such publicity, was that an example might be set
both before the servants of God, to prevent them from committing sacrilege in obedience
to kings, and before kings themselves, that they should show themselves religious by belief
in God? Being willing, therefore, on their part, from the admonition of the very psalm which
you yourself inserted in your writings, both to be wise, and to receive instruction, and to
serve God with fear and to rejoice unto Him with reverence, and to lay hold of instruction,
with what attention do they listen to what that king said afterwards! For he said that he
would make a decree for all the people over whom he ruled, that whosoever should speak
blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego should perish, and their
house be utterly destroyed. And if they know that he made this decree that blasphemy
should not be uttered against the God who tempered the force of the fire, and liberated the
three children, they surely go on to consider what decrees they ought to make in their
kingdom, that the same God who has granted remission of sins, and given freedom to the
whole earth, should not be treated with scorn among the faithful in their realm.</p>
<p>212. See therefore, when Christian kings make any decree against you in defence of
Catholic unity, that it be not the case that with your lips you are accusing them of being
unlearned, as it were, in holy Scripture, while in your hearts you are grieving that they are
so well acquainted with its teaching. For who could put up with the sacrilegious and hateful
fallacy which you advance in the case of one and the same Daniel, to find fault with kings
because he was cast into the den of lions, and to refuse praise to kings in that he was raised
to exalted honor, seeing that, even when he was cast into the den of lions, the king himself
was more inclined to believe that he would be safe than that he would be destroyed, and, in
anxiety for him, refused to eat his food? And then do you dare to say to Christians, "What
have you to do with the kings of the world?" because Daniel suffered persecution at a king’s
hands, and yet not look back upon the same Daniel faithfully interpreting dreams to kings,
calling a king lord, receiving gifts and honors from a king? And so again do you dare, in
the case of the aforesaid three children, to excite the flames of odium against kings, because,
when they refused to worship the statue, they were cast into the flames, while at the same
time you hold your tongue, and say nothing about their being thus extolled and honored
by the king? Granted that the king was a persecutor when he cast Daniel into the lions’ den;
but when, on receiving him safely out again, in his joy and congratulations he cast in his
enemies to be torn in pieces and devoured by the same lions, what was he then,—a persecutor,
or not?2259 I call on you to answer me. For if he was, why did not Daniel himself resist
<note type="footnote">2259 Dan. ii.-vi.</note>

<pb n="1157"/>
him, as he might so easily have done in virtue of his great friendship for him, while yet you
bid us restrain kings from persecuting men? But if he was not a persecutor, because he
avenged with prompt justice the outrage committed against a holy man, what kind of vengeance,
I would ask, must be exacted from kings for indignities offered to the sacraments
of Christ, if the limbs of the prophet required such a vengeance because they were exposed
to danger? Again, I acknowledge that the king, as indeed is manifest, was a persecutor when
he cast the three children into the furnace because they refused to worship his image; but I
ask whether he was still a persecutor when he set forth the decree that all who should blaspheme
against the one true God should be destroyed, and their whole house laid waste?
For if he was a persecutor, why do you answer Amen to the words of a persecutor?2260 But
if he was not a persecutor, why do you call those persecutors who deter you from the madness
of blasphemy? For if they compel you to worship an idol, then they are like the impious
king, and you are like the three children; but if they are preventing you from fighting against
Christ, it is you who are impious if you attempt to do this. But what they may be if they
forbid this with terrible threats, I do not presume to say. Do you find some other name for
them, if you will not call them pious emperors.</p>
<p>213. If I had been the person to bring forward these examples of Daniel and the three
children, you would perhaps resist, and declare that they ought not to have been brought
from those times in illustration of our days; but God be thanked that you yourself brought
them forward, to prove the point, it is true, which you desired to establish, but you see that
their force was rather in favor of what you least would wish to prove. Perhaps you will say
that this proceeds from no deceit of yours, but from the fallibility of human nature. Would
that this were true! Amend it, then You will not lose in reputation nay, it marks unquestionably
the higher mind to extinguish the fire of animosity by a frank confession, than merely
to escape the mist of falsehood by acuteness of the understanding.</p>
<note type="footnote">2260 This is illustrated by the words of Augustin, Epist. 105, ad Donatistas, c. I. 7: "Do ye not know that the
words of the king were: ‘I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward
me. How great are His signs! and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and
His dominion from generation to generation’ (Dan. iv. 2, 3)? Do you not, when you hear this, answer Amen,
and by saying this in a loud voice, place your seal on the king’s decree by a holy and solemn act?" In the Gothic
liturgy this declaration was made on Easter Eve (when the third chapter of Daniel is still read in the Roman
Church), and the people answered "Amen."</note>

your inclination, yet we do it from our love to you, that you may voluntarily correct
yourselves, and live an amended life. For no one lives against his will; and yet a boy, in order
to learn this lesson of his own free will,2261 is beaten contrary to his inclination, and that
often by the very man that is most dear to him. And this, indeed, is what the kings would
desire to say to you if they were to strike you, for to this end their power has been ordained
of God. But you cry out even when they are not striking you.</p>

not be anxious that you should be converted from the error of heresy; but when the very
object of our negotiations with you is that you should cease to be heretics, how are we eagerly
desiring communion with heretics? For, in fact, it is dissension and division that make you
heretics; but peace and unity make men Catholics. When, then, you come over from your

<p>220. Petilianus said: "Choose, in short, which of the two alternatives you
prefer. If innocence is on your side, why do you persecute us with the sword? Or if you call
us guilty, why do you, who are yourselves innocent, seek for our company?"</p>
<p>221. Augustin answered: O most ingenious dilemma, or rather most foolish verbosity!
Is it not usual for the choice of two alternatives to be offered to an antagonist, when it is
impossible that he should adopt both? For if you should offer me the choice of the two
propositions, that I should say either that we were innocent, or that we were guilty; or, again,
of the other pair of propositions, viz., those concerning you, I could not escape choosing
either one or the other. But as it is, you offer me the choice of these two, whether we are
innocent or you are guilty, and wish me to say which of these two I choose for my reply.
But I refuse to make a choice; for I assert them both, that we are innocent, and that you are
guilty. I say that we are innocent of the false and calumnious accusations which you bring
against us, so far as any of us, being in the Catholic Church, can say with a safe conscience
that we have neither given up the sacred books, nor taken part in the worship of idols, nor
murdered any man, nor been guilty of any of the other crimes which you allege against us;
and that any who may have committed any such offenses, which, however, you have not
proved in any case, have thereby shut the doors of the kingdom of heaven, not against us,
but against themselves; "for every man shall bear his own burden."2262 Here you have your
answer on the first head. And I further say that you are all guilty and accursed,—not some
of you owing to the sins of others, which are wrought among you by certain of your number,
and are censured by certain others, but all of you by the sin of schism; from which most
heinous sacrilege no one of you can say that he is free, so long as he refuses to hold communion
with the unity of all nations, unless, indeed, he be compelled to say that Christ has told
a lie concerning the Church which is spread abroad among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
2263 And so you have my second answer. See how I have made you two replies, of
which you were desirous that we should be reduced to choose the one. At any rate, you
should have taken notice that both assertions might be made by us; and certainly, if this was
what you wished, you should have asked it as a favor of us that we should choose one or the
other, when you saw that it was in our power to choose both.</p>
<p>222. But "if innocence is on your side, why do you persecute us with the sword?" Look
back for a moment on your troops, which are not now armed after the ancient fashion of
their fathers only with cudgels, but have further added to their equipment axes and lances
and swords, and determine for yourselves to which of us the question best belongs, "Why
do you persecute us with the sword?" "Or if you call us guilty," say you, "why do you, who
are yourselves innocent, seek for our company?" Here I answer very briefly. The reason
<note type="footnote">2262 Gal. vi. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">2263 Luke xxiv. 47.</note>

<pb n="1162"/>
why you, being guilty, are sought after by the innocent, is that you may cease to be guilty,
and begin to be innocent. Here then I have chosen both of the alternatives concerning us,
and answered both of those concerning you, only do you in turn choose one of the two.
Are you innocent or guilty? Here you cannot choose to make the two assertions, and yet
choose both, if so it pleases you. For at any rate you cannot be innocent in reference to the
same circumstances in respect of which you are guilty. If therefore you are innocent do not
be surprised that you are invited to be at peace with your brethren; but if you are guilty, do
not be surprised that you are sought for punishment by kings. But since of these two alternatives
you assume one for yourselves, and the other is alleged of you by us,—for you assume
to yourselves innocence and it is alleged of you by us that you are living impiously,—hear
again once more what I shall say on either head. If you are innocent, why do you speak
against the testimony of Christ? But if you are guilty, why do you not fly for refuge to His
mercy? For His testimony, on the one hand, is to the unity of the world, and His mercy, on
the other, is in brotherly love.</p>

<p>223. Petilianus said: "Lastly, as we have often said before, how great is
your presumption, that you should speak as you presume to do of kings, when David says,
‘It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man: it is better to trust in the
Lord than to put confidence in princes?’"2264</p>
<p>224. Augustin answered: We put no confidence in man, but, so far as we can, we warn
men to place their trust in the Lord; nor do we put confidence in princes, but, so far as we
can, we warn princes to put confidence in the Lord. And though we may seek aid from
princes to promote the advantage of the Church, yet do we not put confidence in them.
For neither did the apostle himself put confidence in that tribune, in the sense in which the
Psalmist talks of putting confidence in princes, from whom he obtained for himself that an
escort of armed men should be assigned to him; nor did he put confidence in the armed
men, by whose protection he escaped the snares of the wicked ones, in any such sense as
that of the Psalmist where he speaks of putting confidence in men.2265 But neither do we
find fault with you yourselves, because you sought from the emperor that the basilicas should
be restored to you, as though you had put your trust in Julian the prince; but we find fault
with you, that you have despaired of the witness of Christ, from whose unity you have separated
the basilicas themselves. For you received them at the bidding of an enemy of Christ,
that in them you should despise the commands of Christ, whilst you find force and truth
in what Julian ordained, saying, "This, moreover, on the petition of Rogatianus, Pontius,
Cassianus, and other bishops, not without an intermixture of clergy, is added to complete
the whole, that those proceedings which were taken to their prejudice wrongly and without
authority being all annulled, everything should be restored to its former position;" and yet
you find nothing that has either force or truth in what Christ ordained, saying, "Ye shall be
witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole
earth."2266 We entreat you, let yourselves be reformed. Return to this most manifest unity
of the whole world; and let all things be restored to their former position, not in accordance
with the words of the apostate Julian, but in accordance with the words of our Saviour
Christ. Have pity on your own soul. We are not now comparing Constantine and Julian
in order to show how different they are. We are not saying, If you have not placed confidence
in a man and in a prince, when you said to a pagan and apostate emperor, that "in him
justice only found a place," seeing that the party of Donatus has universally employed the
prayers and the rescript in which those words occur, as is proved by the records of the
audience; much less ought we to be accused by you, as though we put our confidence in any
man or prince, if without any blasphemous flattery we obtained any request from Constantine
<note type="footnote">2264 Ps. cxviii. 8, 9.</note>

<pb n="1164"/>
or from the other Christian emperors; or if they themselves, without our asking for it, but
remembering the account which they shall render to the Lord, under whose words they
tremble when they hear what you yourself have quoted, "Be wise now therefore, O ye kings,"
etc., and many other sayings of the sort, make any ordinance of their own accord in support
of the unity of the Catholic Church. But I say nothing about Constantine. It is Christ and
Julian that we contrast before you; nay, more than this, it is God and man, the Son of God
and the son of hell, the Saviour of our souls and the destroyer of his own. Why do you
maintain the rescript of Julian in the occupation of the basilicas, and yet not maintain the
gospel of Christ in embracing the peace of the Church? We too cry out, "Let all things that
have been done amiss be restored to their ancient condition." The gospel of Christ is of
greater antiquity than the rescript of Julian; the unity of Christ is of greater antiquity than
the party of Donatus; the prayers of the Church to the Lord on behalf of the unity of the
Church are of greater antiquity than the prayers of Rogatianus, and Pontius, and Cassianus,
to Julian on behalf of the party of Donatus. Are proceedings wrongly taken when kings
forbid division? and are they not wrongly taken when bishops divide unity? Is that wrong
action when kings minister to the witness of Christ in defence of the Church? and is it not
wrong action when bishops contradict the witness of Christ in order to deny the Church?
We entreat you, therefore, that the words of Julian himself, to whom you thus made supplication,
may be listened to, not in opposition to the gospel, but in accordance with the gospel,
and that "all things which have been done amiss may be restored to their former condition."</p>

whose protection you have won unto yourselves,—just in the same way as sailors, shipwrecked

madness of a tyrant, that he may be free from apprehension of any person whatsoever, desires
to be feared, though this is fraught with peril to himself: so, so you fly for refuge to the citadel
of wickedness, being willing to look on the loss or punishment of the innocent if you may
escape fear for yourselves. If you consider that you escape danger when you plunge into
ruin, truly also it is a faith that merits condemnation to observe the faith of a robber. Lastly,
it is trafficking in a madman’s gains to lose your own souls in order not to lose your wealth.
For the Lord Christ says, ‘If a man shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul, what
shall a man give in exchange for his soul?’"2267</p>
<p>226. Augustin answered: That exhortation of yours would be useful, I cannot but acknowledge,
if any one were to employ it in a good cause. It is undoubtedly well that you
have tried to deter men from preferring their riches to their souls. But I would have you,
who have heard these words, listen also for a time to us; for we also say this, but listen in
what sense. If kings threaten to take away your riches, because you are not Jews according
to the flesh, or because you do not worship idols or devils, or because you are not carried
about into any heresies, but abide in Catholic unity, then choose rather that your riches
should perish, that you perish not yourselves; but be careful to prefer neither anything else,
nor the life of this world itself, to eternal salvation, which is in Christ. But if kings threaten
you with loss or condemnation, simply on the ground that you are heretics, such things are
terrifying you not in cruelty, but in mercy; and your determination not to fear is a sign not
of bravery, but of obstinacy. Hear then the words of Peter, where he says, "What glory is it,
if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye take it patiently?"2268 so that herein you have
neither consolation upon earth, nor in the world to come life everlasting; but you have here
the miseries of the unfortunate, and there the hell of heretics. Do you see, therefore, my
brother, with whom I am now arguing, that you ought first to show whether you hold the
truth, and then to exhort men that in upholding it they should be ready to give up all the
blessings which they possess in this present world? And so, when you do not show this,
because you cannot,—not that the talent is wanting, but because the cause is bad,—why do
you hasten by your exhortations to make men both beggars and ignorant, both in want and
wandering from the truth, in rags and contentions, household drudges and heretics, both

losing their temporal goods in this world, and finding eternal evils in the judgment of Christ?
But the cautious son, who, while he stands in dread of his father’s rod, keeps away from the
lair of the serpent, escapes both blows and destruction; whereas he who despises the pains
of discipline, when set in rivalry with his own pernicious will, is both beaten and destroyed.
Do you not now understand, O learned man, that he who has resigned all earthly goods in
order to maintain the peace of Christ, possesses God; whereas he who has lost even a very
few coins in behalf of the party of Donatus is devoid of heart?</p>

<p>227. Petilianus said: "But we who are poor in spirit2269 are not apprehensive
for our wealth, but rather feel a dread of wealth. We, ‘as having nothing, and yet
possessing all things,’2270 look on our soul as our wealth, and by our punishments and blood
purchase to ourselves the everlasting riches of heaven. So again the same Lord says, ‘Whosoever
shall lose his substance, shall find it again an hundred fold.’"</p>
<p>228. Augustin answered: It is not beside the purpose to inquire into the true meaning
of this passage also. For where my purpose is not interfered with by any mistake which you
make, or any false impression which you convey in quoting from the Scriptures, I do not
concern myself about the matter. It is not then written, "Whosoever shall lose his substance,"
but "Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake." 2271 And the passage about substance is not,
"Whosoever shall lose," but "Every one that hath forsaken;"2272 and that not only with reference
to substance of money, but many other things besides. But you meanwhile have not
lost your substance; but whether you have forsaken it, in that you so boast of poverty, I
cannot say. And if by any chance my colleague Fortunatus may know this, being in the
same city with you, he never told me, because I had never asked him. However, even if you
had done this, you have yet yourself quoted the testimony of the apostle against yourself in
this very epistle which you have written: "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,
and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."2273
For if you had charity, you would not bring charges against the whole world, which knows
nothing of you, and of which you know no more,—no, not even such charges as are founded
on the proved offenses of the Africans. If you had charity, you would not picture to yourself
a false unity in your calumnies, but you would learn to recognize the unity that is most
clearly set forth in the words of the Lord: "even in the whole earth."2274 But if you did not
do this, why do you boast as though you had done it? Are you really so filled with fear of
riches, that, having nothing, you possess all things? Tell that to your colleague Crispinus,
who lately bought a farm near our city of Hippo, that he might there plunge men into the
lowest abyss.2275 Whence I too know this all too well. You perhaps are not aware of it, and
therefore shout out in security, "We stand in fear of riches." And hence I am surprised that
that cry of yours has been allowed to pass Crispinus, so as to reach us. For between Constantina,
where you are, and Hippo, where I am, lies Calama, where he is, nearer indeed to

our side, but still between us. I wonder, therefore, how it was that he did not first intercept
this cry, and strike it back so that it should not reach to our ears; and that he did not, in
opposition to you, recite in much more copious phrase a eulogy on riches. For he not only
stands in no fear of riches, but he actually loves them. And certainly, before you utter anything
about the rest, you should rehearse such views to him. If he makes no corrections,
then we have our answer ready. But for yourself, if it be true that you are poor, you have
with you my brother Fortunatus. You will be more likely with such sentiments to please
him, who is my colleague, than Crispinus, who is your own.</p>

<p>229. Petilianus said: "Inasmuch as we live in the fear of God, we have
no fear of the punishments and executions which you wreak with the sword; but the only
thing which we avoid is that by your most wicked communion you destroy men’s souls,
according to the saying of the Lord Himself: ‘Fear not them which kill the body, but are not
able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in
hell.’"2276</p>

sword, but with that of which it is said, "The sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
and their tongue a sharp sword."2277 For with this sword of accusation and calumny against
the world of which you are wholly ignorant, you destroy the souls of those who lack experience.
But if you find fault with a most wicked communion, as you term it, I would bid you

about, change sides, be such as was Optatus. But if you return to your senses, and shall find
that you are not such as he, not because he refused to partake of the sacraments with you,
but because you took offense at what he did, then you will acquit the world of crimes which
do not belong to it, and you will find yourself involved in the sin of schism.</p>

<p>231. Petilianus said: "You, therefore, who prefer rather to be washed
with the most false of baptisms than to be regenerate, not only do not lay aside your sins,
but also load your souls with the offenses of criminals. For as the water of the guilty has
been abandoned by the Holy Spirit, so it is clearly filled full of the offenses of the traditors.
To any wretched man, then, who is baptized by one of this sort, we would say, If you have
wished to be free from falsehood, you are really drenched with falsity. If you desired to shut
out the sins of the flesh, you will, as the conscience of the guilty comes upon you, be partakers
likewise of their guilt. If you wished to extinguish the flames of avarice, you are drenched
with deceit, you are drenched with wickedness, you are drenched also with madness. Lastly,
if you believe that faith is identical in the giver and the receiver, you are drenched with the
blood of a brother by him who slays a man. And so it comes to pass that you, who had come
to baptism free from sin, return from baptism guilty of the sin of murder."</p>
<p>232. Augustin answered: I should like to come to argument with those who shouted
assent when they either heard or read those words of yours. For such men have not ears in
their hearts, but their heart in their ears. Yet let them read again and again, and consider,
and find out for themselves, not what the sound of those words is, but what they mean.
First of all, to sift the meaning of the last clause, "So it comes to pass," you say, "that you
who had come to baptism free from sin, return from baptism guilty of the sin of murder:"
tell me, to begin with, who there is that comes to baptism free from sin, with the single exception
of Him who came to be baptized, not that His iniquity should be purged away, but
that an example of humility might be given us? For what shall be forgiven to one free from
sin? Or are you indeed endowed with such an eloquence, that you can show to us some
innocence which yet committeth sin? Do you not hear the words of Scripture saying, "No
one is clean from sin in Thy sight, not even the infant whose life is but of a single day upon
the earth?"2278 For whence else is it that one hastens even with infants to seek remission of
their sins? Do you not hear the words of another Scripture, "In sin did my mother conceive
me?"2279 In the next place, if a man returns a murderer, who had come without the guilt
of murder, merely because he receives baptism at a murderer’s hands, then all they who returned
from receiving baptism at the hands of Optatus were made partakers with Optatus.
Go now, and see with what face you cast in our teeth that we excite the wrath of kings against
you. Are you not afraid that as many satellites of Gildo will be sought for among you, as
there are men who may have been baptized by Optatus? Do you see at length how that
sentence of yours, like an empty bladder, has rattled not only with a meaningless sound,
but on your own head?</p>

<note type="footnote">2279 Ps. li. 5.</note>

<pb n="1171"/>
<p>233. To go on to the other earlier arguments which you have set before us to be refuted,
they are of such a nature that we must needs allow that every one returns from baptism
endued with the character of him by whom he is baptized; but God forbid that those whom
you baptize should return from you infected with the same madness as possesses you when
you make such a statement! And what a dainty sound there was in your words, "You are
drenched with deceit, you are drenched with wickedness, you are drenched also with madness!"
Surely you would never pour forth words like this unless you were, not drenched,
but filled even to repletion with madness. Is it then true, to say nothing of the rest, that all
who come untainted with covetousness to receive baptism at the hands of your covetous
colleagues, or the priests of your party, return guilty of covetousness, and that those who
run in soberness to the whirlpool of intoxication to be baptized return in drunkenness? If
you entertain and teach such views as this, you will have the effrontery even to quote, as
making against us, the passage which you advanced some little time ago: "It is better to trust
in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence
in princes."2280 What is the meaning of your teaching, I would ask, save only this,
that we should put our confidence not in the Lord, but in man, when you say that the baptized
person is made to resemble him who has baptized him? And since you assume this as the
fundamental principle of your baptism, are men to place their trust in you? and are those
to place their trust in princes who were disposed to place it in the Lord? Truly I would bid
them hearken not to you, but rather to those proofs which you have urged against ourselves,
ay, and to words more awful yet; for not only is it written, "It is better to trust in the Lord
than to put confidence in man," but also, "Cursed be the man that trusteth in man."2281</p>

<p>234. Petilianus said: "Imitate indeed the prophets, who feared to have
their holy souls deceived with false baptism. For Jeremiah says of old that among impious
men water is as one that lies. ‘Water,’ he says, ‘that lies has not faith.’"</p>
<p>235. Augustin answered: Any one that hears these words, without being acquainted
with the Scriptures, and who does not believe that you are either so far astray as not to know
what you are saying, or deceiving in such wise that he whom you have deceived should not
know what he says, would believe that the prophet Jeremiah, wishing to be baptized, had
taken precautions not to be baptized by impious men, and had used these words with this
intent. For what was your object in saying, previous to your quotation of this passage,
"Imitate indeed the prophets, who feared to have their holy souls deceived with false baptism?"
Just as though, in the days of Jeremiah, any one were washed with the sacrament of
baptism, except so far as the Pharisees almost every moment bathed themselves, and their
couches and cups and platters, with the washings which the Lord condemned, as we read
in the gospel.2282 How then could Jeremiah have said this, as though he desired to be baptized,
and sought to avoid being baptized by impious men? He said it, then, when he was
complaining of a faithless people, by the corruption of whose morals he was vexed, not
wishing to associate with their deeds; and yet he did not separate himself bodily from their
congregation, nor seek other sacraments than those which the people received as suitable
to that time, according to the law of Moses. To this people, therefore, in their evil mode of
life, he gave the name of "a wound," with which the heart of the righteous man was grievously
smitten, whether speaking thus of himself, or foreshadowing in himself what he foresaw
would come to pass. For he speaks as follows: "O Lord, remember me, and visit me; make
clear my innocence before those who persecute me in no spirit of long-suffering: know that
for Thy sake I have suffered rebuke from those that scorn Thy words. Make their portion
complete; and Thy word shall be unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am
called by Thy name, O Lord God of hosts. I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, but was
afraid of the presence of Thy hand; I sat alone, because I was filled with bitterness. Why do
those who make me sad prevail against me? My wound is grievous; whence shall I be healed?
It is become unto me as lying water, that has no faith."2283 In all this it is manifest what the
prophet wished to be understood, but manifest only to those who do not wish to distort to
their own perverse cause the meaning of what they read. For Jeremiah says that his wound
has become unto him as lying water, which cannot inspire faith; but he wished that by his
wound those should be understood who made him sad by the evil conduct of their lives.
Whence also the apostle says, "Without were fightings, within were fears;" 2284 and again,

"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?"2285 And because he
had no hopes that they could be reformed, therefore he said, "Whence shall I be healed?" as
though his own pain must needs continue so long as those among whom he was compelled
to live continued what they were. But that a people is commonly understood under the
appellation of water is shown in the Apocalypse, where we understand "many waters" to
mean "many peoples," not by any conjecture of our own, but by an express explanation in
the place itself. 2286 Abstain then from blaspheming the sacrament of baptism from any
misunderstanding, or rather error, even when found in a man of most abandoned character;
for not even in the lying Simon was the baptism which he received a lying water,2287 nor
do all the liars of your party administer a lying water when they baptize in the name of the
Trinity. For neither do they begin to be liars only when they are betrayed and convicted,
and so forced to acknowledge their misdeeds; but rather they were already liars, when, being
adulterers and accursed, they pretended to be chaste and innocent.</p>

<p>236. Petilianus said: "David also said, ‘The oil of the sinner shall not
anoint my head.’ Who is it, therefore, that he calls a sinner? Is it I who suffer your violence,
or you who persecute the innocent?"</p>
<p>237. Augustin answered: As representing the body of Christ, which is the Church of
the living God, the pillar and mainstay of the truth, dispersed throughout the world, on account
of the gospel which was preached, according to the words of the apostle, "to every
creature which is under heaven:"2288 as representing the whole world, of which David,
whose words you cannot understand, has said, "The world also is stablished, that it cannot
be moved;"2289 whereas you contend that it not only has been moved, but has been utterly
destroyed: as representing this, I answer, I do not persecute the innocent. But David said,
"The oil of the sinner," not of the traditor; not of him who offers incense, not of the persecutor,
but "of the sinner." What then will you make of your interpretation? See first
whether you are not yourself a sinner. It is nothing to the point if you should say, I am not
a traditor, I am not an offerer of incense, I am not a persecutor. I myself, by the grace of
God, am none of these, nor is the world, which cannot be moved. But say, if you dare, I am
not a sinner. For David says, "The oil of the sinner." For so long as any sin, however light,
be found in you, what ground have you for maintaining that you are not concerned in the
expression that is used, "The oil of the sinner"? For I would ask whether you use the Lord’s
prayer in your devotions? For if you do not use that prayer, which our Lord taught His
disciples for their use, where have you learned another, proportioned to your merits, as exceeding
the merits of the apostles? But if you pray, as our great Master deigned to teach us,
how do you say, "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us?"
For in this petition we are not referring to those sins which have already been forgiven us
in baptism. Therefore these words in the prayer either exclude you from being a petitioner
to God, or else they make it manifest that you too are a sinner. Let those then come and
kiss your head who have been baptized by you, whose heads have perished through your
oil. But see to yourself, both what you are and what you think about yourself. Is it really
true that Optatus, whom pagans, Jews, Christians, men of our party, men of your party, all
proclaim throughout the whole of Africa to have been a thief, a traitor, an oppressor, a
contriver of schism; not a friend, not a client, but a tool of him2290 whom one of your party
declared to have been his count, companion, and god,—is it true that he was not a sinner
in any conceivable interpretation of the term? What then will they do whose heads were
anointed by one guilty of a capital offense? Do not those very men kiss your heads, on whose
heads you pass so serious a judgment by this interpretation which you place upon the pas-

sage? Truly I would bid you bring them forth, and admonish them to heal themselves. Or
is it rather your heads which should be healed, who run so grievously astray? What then,
you will ask, did David really say: Why do you ask me: rather ask himself. He answers you
in the verse above: "The righteous shall smite me in kindness, and shall reprove me; but let
not the oil of the sinner anoint my head."2291 What could be plainer? what more manifest?
I had rather, he says, be healed by a rebuke administered in kindness, than be deceived and
led astray by smooth flattery, coming on me as an ointment on my head. The self-same
sentiment is found elsewhere in Scripture under other words: "Better are the wounds of a
friend than the proffered kisses of an enemy."2292</p>

<p>238. Petilianus said: "But he thus praises the ointment of concord among
brethren: ‘Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s
beard; that went down to the skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew
that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing,
even life for evermore.’2293 Thus, he says, is unity anointed, even as the priests are anointed."</p>
<p>239. Augustin answered: What you say is true. For that priesthood in the body of
Christ had an anointing, and its salvation is secured by the bond of unity. For indeed Christ
Himself derives His name from chrism, that is, from anointing. Him the Hebrews call the
Messiah, which word is closely akin to the Phoenician language, as is the case with very
many other Hebrew words, if not with almost all. 2294 What then is meant by the head in
that priesthood, what by the beard, what by the skirts of the garments? So far as the Lord
enables me to understand, the head is none other than the Saviour of the body, of whom
the apostle says, "And He is the head of the body, the Church."2295 By the beard is not unsuitably
understood fortitude. Therefore, on those who show themselves to be brave in His
Church, and cling to the light of His countenance, to preach the truth without fear, there
descends from Christ Himself, as from the head, a sacred ointment, that is to say, the sanctification
of the Spirit. By the skirts of the garments we are here given to understand that
which is at the top of the garments, through which the head of Him who gives the clothing
enters. By this are signified those who are perfected in faith within the Church. For in the
skirts is perfection. And I presume you must remember what was said to a certain rich
man: "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shall
have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me."2296 He indeed went away sorrowful,
slighting what was perfect, choosing what was imperfect. But does it follow that there were
wanting those who were so made perfect by such a surrender of earthly things, that the
ointment of unity descended upon them, as from the head upon the skirts of the garments?
For, putting aside the apostles, and those who were immediately associated with those
leaders and teachers of the Church, whom we understand to be represented with greater
dignity and more conspicuous fortitude in the beard, read in the Acts of the Apostles, and

see those who "brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the
apostles’ feet. Neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his
own: but they had all things common: and distribution was made unto every man according
as he had need. And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one
soul."2297 I doubt not that you are aware that it is so written. Recognize, therefore, how
good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. Recognize the beard of
Aaron; recognize the skirts of the spiritual garments. Search the Scriptures themselves, and
see where those things began to be done; you will find that it was in Jerusalem. From this
skirt of the garment is woven together the whole fabric of unity throughout all nations. By
this the Head entered into the garment, that Christ should be clothed with all the variety of
the several nations of the earth, because in this skirt of the garment appeared the actual
variety of tongues. Why, therefore, is the Head itself, whence that ointment of unity descended,
that is, the spiritual fragrance of brotherly love,—why, I say, is the Head itself exposed
to your resistance, while it testifies and declares that "repentance and remission of sins
should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem"?2298 And by
this ointment you wish the sacrament of chrism to be understood, which is indeed holy as
among the class of visible signs, like baptism itself, but yet can exist even among the worst
of men, wasting their life in the works of the flesh, and never destined to possess the kingdom
of heaven, and having therefore nothing to do either with the beard of Aaron, or with the
skirts of his garments, or with any fabric of priestly clothing. For where do you intend to
place what the apostle enumerates as "the manifest works of the flesh, which," he says, "are
these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, poisonings, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the
which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God?"2299 I put aside fornications, which are committed
in secret; interpret uncleanness as you please, I am willing to put it aside as well. Let us put
on one side also poisons, since no one is openly a compounder or giver of poisons. I put
aside also heresies, since you will have it so. I am in doubt whether I ought to put aside idolatry,
since the apostle classes with it covetousness, which is openly rife among you.
However, setting aside all these, are there none among you lascivious, none covetous, none
open in their indulgence of enmities, none fond of strife, or fond of emulation, wrathful,
given to seditions, envious, drunken, wasting their time in revellings? Are none of such a
character anointed among you? Do none die well known among you to be given to such
things, or openly indulging in them? If you say there are none, I would have you consider

whether you do not come under the description yourself, since you are manifestly telling
lies in the desire for strife. But if you are yourself severed from men of this sort, not by
bodily separation, but by dissimilarity of life, and if you behold with lamentation crowds
like these around your altars, what shall we say, since they are anointed with holy oil, and
yet, as the apostle assures us with the clearness of truth, shall not inherit the kingdom of
God? Must we do such impious despite to the beard of Aaron and to the skirts of his garments,
as to suppose that they are to be placed there? Far be that from us. Separate therefore
the visible holy sacrament, which can exist both in the good and in the bad,—in the former
for their reward, in the latter for judgment; separate it from the invisible unction of charity,
which is the peculiar property of the good. Separate them, separate them, ay, and may God
separate you from the party of Donatus, and call you back again into the Catholic Church,
whence you were torn by them while yet a catechumen, to be bound by them in the bond
of a deadly distinction. Now are ye not in the mountains of Zion, the dew of Hermon on
the mountains of Zion, in whatever sense that be received by you; for you are not in the city
upon a hill, which has this as its sure sign, that it cannot be hid. It is known therefore unto
all nations. But the party of Donatus is unknown to the majority of nations, therefore is it
not the true city.</p>

<p>240. Petilianus said: "Woe unto you, therefore, who, by doing violence
to what is holy, cut away the bond of unity; whereas the prophet says, ‘If the people shall
sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?’"</p>
<p>241. Augustin answered: I seemed too a little while ago, when we were disputing about
the oil of the sinner, to anoint your forehead, in order that you might say, if you dared,
whether you yourself were not a sinner. You have had the hardihood to say as much. What
a portentous sin! For in that you assert yourself to be a priest, what else have you maintained
by quoting this testimony of the prophet, save that you are wholly without sin? For if you
have sin, who is there that shall pray for you, according to your understanding of the words?
For thus you blazon yourselves among the wretched people, quoting from the prophet: "If
the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray
for him?2300 to the intent that they may believe you to be without sin, and entrust the wiping
away their sins to your prayers. Truly ye are great men, exalted above your fellows, heavenly,
godlike, angels indeed rather than men, who pray for the people, and will not have the people
pray for you! Are you more righteous than Paul, more perfect than that great apostle, who
was wont to commend himself to the prayers of those whom he taught? "Continue," he
says, "in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; withal praying also for us, that
God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am
also in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."2301 See how prayer is made
for an apostle, which you would have not made for a bishop. Do you perceive of how devilish
a nature your pride is? Prayer is made for an apostle, that he may make manifest the
mystery of Christ as he ought to speak. Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you,
you ought to have exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not give utterance as you
ought not. Are you more righteous than the evangelist John, who says, "If we say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?"2302 Finally, are you more
righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted in this very epistle, going so far as to say,
"The most righteous king cast forth Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by wild beasts?"—a
thing which he never did suppose, since he said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly
spirit, as the context of the lesson shows, "Thy God, whom thou servest continually, He will
deliver thee."2303 But on this subject we have already said much. With regard to the question
now before us, viz., that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your testimony,
though that might be sufficient for me in the argument which I hold with you, but by the
testimony of the Spirit of God, speaking also by the mouth of Ezekiel, where he named three

men of most eminent righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job, who, he said, were the only
men that could be saved from a certain excessive wrath of God, which was hanging over all
the rest.2304 A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one of three conspicuous for
righteousness, prays, and says, "While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin,
and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God."2305
And you say that you are without sin, because forsooth you are a priest; and if the people
sin, you pray for them: but if you sin, who shall pray for you? For clearly by the impiety of
such arrogance you show yourself to be unworthy of the mediation of that Priest whom the
prophet would have to be understood in these words, which you do not understand. For
now that no one may ask why this was said, I will explain it so far as by God’s grace I shall
be able. God was preparing the minds of men, by His prophet, to desire a Priest of such a
sort that none should pray for Him. He was Himself prefigured in the times of the first
people and the first temple, in which all things were figures for our ensample. Therefore
the high priest used to enter alone into the holy of holies, that he might make supplication
for the people, which did not enter with the priest into that inner sanctuary;2306 just as our
High Priest is entered into the secret places of the heavens, into that truer holy of holies,
whilst we for whom He prays are still placed here.2307 It is with this reference that the
prophet says, "If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall
sin, who will pray for him?" Seek therefore a priest of such a kind that he cannot sin, nor
need that one should pray for him. And for this reason prayer is made for the apostles by
the people;2308 but for that Priest who is the Master and Lord of the apostles is prayer not
made. Hear John confessing this, and saying, "My little children, these things write I unto
you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins."2309 "We have," he says; and "for our
sins." I pray you, learn humility, that you may not fall, or rather, that in time you may arise
again. For had you not already fallen, you never would have used such words.</p>

<p>242. Petilianus said: "And that none who is a layman may claim to be
free from sin, they are all bound by this prohibition: ‘Be not partakers of other men’s sins.’"</p>
<p>243. Augustin answered: You are mistaken toto cælo, as the saying is, by reason of your
pride, whilst, by reason of your humility, you are unwilling to communicate with the whole
world. For, in the first place, this was not spoken to a layman; and, in the second place, you
are wholly ignorant in what sense it was spoken. The apostle, writing to Timothy, gives this
warning to none other than Timothy himself, to whom he says in another place, "Neglect
not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands
of the presbytery."2310 And by many other proofs it is made clear that he was not a layman.
But in that he says, "Be not partaker of other men’s sins,"2311 he means, Be not partaker
voluntarily, or with consent. And hence he immediately subjoins directions how he shall
obey the injunction, saying, "Keep thyself pure." For neither was Paul himself partaker of
other men’s sins, because he endured false brethren, over whom he groans, in bodily unity;
nor did the apostles who preceded him partake of the thievery and crime of Judas, because
they partook of the holy supper with him when he had already sold his Lord, and been
pointed out as the traitor by that Lord.</p>

same category those who have fellowship in the consciousness of evil. ‘Worthy of death,’
he says, ‘are both those who do such things, and those who consent with those that do
them.’"2312</p>
<p>245. Augustin answered: I care not in what manner you have used these words, they
are true. And this is the substance of the teaching of the Catholic Church, that there is a
great difference between those who consent because they take pleasure in such things, and
those who tolerate while they dislike them. The former make themselves chaff, while they
follow the barrenness of the chaff; the latter are the grain. Let them wait for Christ, who
bears the winnowing-fan, that they may be separated from the chaff.</p>

<p>246. Petilianus said: "Come therefore to the Church, all ye people, and
flee the company of traditors, if you would not also perish with them. For that you may the
more readily know that, while they are themselves guilty, they yet entertain an excellent
opinion of our faith, let me inform you that I baptize their polluted ones; they, though may
God never grant them such an opportunity, receive those who are made mine by baptism,—
which certainly they would not do if they recognized any defects in our baptism.
See therefore how holy that is which we give, when even our sacrilegious enemy fears to
destroy it."</p>
<p>247. Augustin answered: Against this error I have said much already, both in this work
and elsewhere. But since you think that in this sentence you have so strong a confirmation
of your vain opinions, that you deemed it right to end your epistle with these words, that
they might remain as it were the fresher in the minds of your readers, I think it well to make
a short reply. We recognize in heretics that baptism, which belongs not to the heretics but
to Christ, in such sort as in fornicators, in unclean persons or effeminate, in idolaters, in
poisoners, in those who retain enmity, in those who are fond of contention, in the credulous,
in the proud, given to seditions, in the envious, in drunkards, in revellers; and in men like
these we hold valid the baptism which is not theirs but Christ’s. For of men like these, and
among them are included heretics also, none, as the apostle says, shall inherit the kingdom
of heaven.2313 Nor are they to be considered as being in the body of Christ, which is the
Church, simply because they are materially partakers of the sacraments. For the sacraments
indeed are holy, even in such men as these, and shall be of force in them to greater condemnation,
because they handle and partake of them unworthily. But the men themselves are
not within the constitution of the Church, which increases in the increase of God in its
members through connection and contact with Christ. For that Church is founded on a
rock, as the Lord says, "Upon this rock I will build my Church."2314 But they build on the
sand, as the same Lord says, "Every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them
not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand."2315 But that
you may not suppose that the Church which is upon a rock is in one part only of the earth,
and does not extend even to its furthest boundaries, hear her voice groaning from the psalm,
amid the evils of her pilgrimage. For she says, "From the end of the earth have I cried unto
Thee; when my heart was distressed Thou didst lift me up upon the rock; Thou hast led me,
Thou, my hope, hast become a tower of courage from the face of the enemy." 2316 See how
she cries from the end of the earth. She is not therefore in Africa alone, nor only among

the Africans, who send a bishop from Africa to Rome to a few Montenses,2317 and into
Spain to the house of one lady.2318 See how she is exalted on a rock. All, therefore, are not
to be deemed to be in her which build upon the sand, that is, which hear the words of Christ
and do them not, even though both among us and among you they have and transmit the
sacrament of baptism. See how her hope is in God the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost,—not in Peter or in Paul, still less in Donatus or Petilianus. What we fear, therefore,
to destroy, is not yours, but Christ’s; and it is holy of itself, even in sacrilegious hands. For
we cannot receive those who come from you, unless we destroy in them whatsoever appertains
to you. For we destroy the treachery of the deserter, not the stamp of the sovereign.
Accordingly, do you yourself consider and annul what you said: "I," say you, "baptize their
polluted ones; they, though may God never grant them such an opportunity, receive those
who are made mine by baptism." For you do not baptize men who are infected, but you
rebaptize them, so as to infect them with the fraud of your error. But we do not receive men
who are made yours by baptism; but we destroy that error of yours whereby they are made
yours, and we receive the baptism of Christ, by which they are baptized. Therefore it is not
without significance that you introduce the words, "Though may God never grant them
such an opportunity." For you said, "They, though may God never grant them such an opportunity,
receive those who are made mine by baptism." For while you in your fear that
we may receive your followers desire to be understood, "may God never give them the opportunity
of receiving such as are mine," I suppose that, without knowing what it meant,
you said, "May God never make them mine that you should receive them." For we pray that
those may not be really yours who come over at the present moment to the Catholic Church.
Nor do they come over so as to be ours by right of baptism, but by fellowship with us, and
that with us they may belong to Christ, in virtue of their baptism.</p>

<head>Chapter 1.</head>
<p>1. Being able to read, Petilianus, I have read your letter, in which you have
shown with sufficient clearness that, in supporting the party of Donatus against the Catholic
Church, you have neither been able to say anything to the purpose, nor been allowed to
hold your tongue. What violent emotions did you endure, what a storm of feelings surged
within your heart, on reading the answer which I made, with all possible brevity and clearness,
to that portion of your letter which alone at that time had come into my hands! For you
saw that the truth which we maintain and defend was confirmed with such strength of argument,
and illustrated with such abundant light, that you could not find anything which
could be said against it, whereby the charges which we make might be refuted. You observed,
also, that the attention of many who had read it was fixed on you, since they desired to know
what you would say, what you would do, how you would escape from the difficulty, how
you would make your way out of the strait in which the word of God had encompassed you.
Hereupon you, when you ought to have shown contempt for the opinion of the foolish ones,
and to have gone on to adopt sound and truthful sentiments, preferred rather to do what
Scripture has foretold of men like you: "Thou hast loved evil more than good, and lying
rather than to speak righteousness."2320 Just as if I in turn were willing to recompense unto
you railing for railing; in which case, what should we be but two evil speakers, so that those
who read our words would either preserve their self-respect by throwing us aside with abhorrence,
or eagerly devour what we wrote to gratify their malice? For my own part, since
I answer every one, whether in writing or by word of mouth, even when I have been attacked
with insulting accusations, in such language as the Lord puts in my mouth, restraining and
crushing the stings of empty indignation in the interests of my hearer or reader, I do not
strive to prove myself superior to my adversary by abusing him, but rather to be a source
of health in him by convicting him of his error.</p>
<p>2. For if those who take into consideration what you have written have any feelings
whatsoever, how did it serve you in the cause which is at issue between us respecting the
Catholic communion and the party of Donatus, that, leaving a matter which was in a certain
sense of public interest, you should have been led by private animosity to attack the life of
an individual with malicious revilings, just as though that individual were the question in
debate? Did you think so badly, I do not say of Christians, but of the whole human race, as
not to suppose that your writings might come into the hands of some prudent men, who
would lay aside all thoughts of individuals like us, and inquire rather into the question which
was at issue between us, and pay heed, not to who and what we were, but to what we might
be able to advance in defense of the truth or against error? You should have paid respect
to these men’s judgment, you should have guarded yourself against their censure, lest they
should think that you could find nothing to say, unless you set before yourself some one
<note type="footnote">2320 Ps. lii. 3.</note>

<pb n="1187"/>
whom you might abuse by any means within your power. But one may see by the
thoughtlessness and foolishness of some men, who listen eagerly to the quarrels of any
learned disputants, that while they take notice of the eloquence wherewith you lavish your
abuse, they do not perceive with what truth you are refuted. At the same time, I think your
object partly was that I might be driven, by the necessity of defending myself, to desert the
very cause which I had undertaken; and that so, while men’s attention was turned to the
words of opponents who were engaged not in disputation, but in quarrelling, the truth might
be obscured, which you are so afraid should come to light and be well known among men.
What therefore was I to do in opposing such a design as this, except to keep strictly to my
subject, neglecting rather my own defense, praying withal that no personal calumny may
lead me to withdraw from it? I will exalt the house of my God, whose honor I have loved,
with the tribute of a faithful servant’s voice, but myself I will humiliate and hold of no account.
"I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
heretics."2321 I will therefore turn my discourse from you, Petilianus, for a time, and direct
it rather to those whom you have endeavored to turn away from me by your revilings, as
though my endeavor rather were that men should be converted unto me, and not rather
with me unto God.</p>

<p>3. Hear therefore, all ye who have read his revilings, what Petilianus has
vented against me with more anger than consideration. To begin with, I will address you
in the words of the apostle, which certainly are true, whatever I myself may be: "Let a man
so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. But with me it is a very
small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own
self." With regard to what immediately follows, although I do not venture to apply to myself
the words, "For I am conscious of nothing in myself,"2322 yet I say confidently in the sight
of God, that I am conscious in myself of none of those charges which Petilianus has brought
against my life since the time when I was baptized in Christ; "yet am I not hereby justified,
but He that judgeth me is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord
come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest
the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of God. And these things,
brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself; that ye might learn in us not to think of
men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."2323
"Therefore let no man glory in men: for all things are yours; and ye are Christ’s; and Christ
is God’s."2324 Again I say, "Let no man glory in men;" nay, oftentimes I repeat it, "Let no
man glory in men." If you perceive anything in us which is deserving of praise, refer it all
to His praise, from whom is every good gift and every perfect gift; for it is "from above, and
cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning."2325 For what have we which we did not receive? and if we have received it, let us
not boast as though we had not received it.2326 And in all these things which you know to
be good in us, be ye our followers, at any rate, if we are Christ’s;2327 but if, on the other
hand, you either suspect, or believe, or see that any evil is in us, hold fast to that saying of
the Lord’s, in which you may safely resolve not to desert His Church because of men’s ill
deeds. Whatsoever we bid you observe, that observe and do; but whatsoever evil works you
think or know to be in us, those do ye not.2328 For this is not the time for me to justify
myself before you, when I have undertaken, neglecting all considerations of self, to recommend
to you what is for your salvation, that no one should make his boast of men. For
"cursed be the man that trusteth in man."2329 So long as this precept of the Lord and His

apostle be adhered to and observed, the cause which I serve will be victorious, even if I myself,
as my enemy would fain have thought, am faint and oppressed in my own cause. For if you
cling most firmly to what I urge on you with all my might, that every one is cursed who
places his trust in man, so that none should make his boast of man, then you will in no wise
desert the threshing-floor of the Lord on account of the chaff which either is now being
dispersed beneath the blast of the wind of pride, or will be separated by the final winnowing;
2330 nor will you fly from the great house on account of the vessels made to dishonor;2331
nor will you quit the net through the breaches made in it because of the bad fish which are
to be separated on the shore;2332 nor will you leave the good pastures of unity, because of
the goats which are to be placed on the left when the Good Shepherd shall divide the flock;2333
nor will you separate yourselves by an impious secession, because of the mixture of the tares,
from the society of that good wheat, whose source is that grain that dies and is multiplied
thereby, and that grows together throughout the world until the harvest. For the field is the
world,—not only Africa; and the harvest is the end of the world,2334—not the era of Donatus.</p>

<p>4. These comparisons of the gospel you doubtless recognize. Nor can we
suppose them given for any other purpose, except that no one should make his boast in
man, and that no one should be puffed up for one against another, or divided one against
another, saying, "I am of Paul," when certainly Paul was not crucified for you, nor were you
baptized in the name of Paul, much less in that of Cæcilianus, or of any one of us, 2335 that
you may learn, that so long as the chaff is being bruised with the corn, so long as the bad
fishes swim together with the good in the nets of the Lord, till the time of separation shall
come, it is your duty rather to endure the admixture of the bad out of consideration for the
good, than to violate the principle of brotherly love towards the good from any consideration
of the bad. For this admixture is not for eternity, but for time alone; nor is it spiritual, but
corporal. And in this the angels will not be liable to err, when they shall collect the bad from
the midst of the good, and commit them to the burning fiery furnace. For the Lord knoweth
those which are His. And if a man cannot depart bodily from those who practise iniquity
so long as time shall last, at any rate, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart
from iniquity itself.2336 For in the meantime he may separate himself from the wicked in
life, and in morals, and in heart and will, and in the same respects depart from his society;
and separation such as this should always be maintained. But let the separation in the body
be waited for till the end of time, faithfully, patiently, bravely. In consideration of which
expectation it is said, "Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine
heart; wait, I say, upon the Lord." 2337 For the greatest palm of toleration is won by those
who, among false brethren that have crept in unawares, seeking their own, and not the
things of Jesus Christ, yet show that they on their part seek not to disturb the love which is
not their own, but Jesus Christ’s, by any turbulent or rash dissension, nor to break the unity
of the Lord’s net, in which are gathered together fish of every kind; till it is drawn to the
shore, that is, till the end of time, by any wicked strife fostered in the spirit of pride: whilst
each might think himself to be something, being really nothing, and so might lead himself
astray, and wish that sufficient reason might be found for the separation of Christian peoples
in the judgment of himself or of his friends, who declare that they know beyond all question
certain wicked men unworthy of communion in the sacraments of the Christian religion:
though whatever it may be that they know of them, they cannot persuade the universal
Church, which, as it was foretold, is spread abroad throughout all nations, to give credit to
their tale. And when they refuse communion with these men, as men whose character they
know, they desert the unity of the Church; whereas they ought rather, if there really were

nation, lest they should separate themselves from the good whom they were unable
throughout all nations to fill with the teaching of evil alien to them. Whence even, without
discussing the case, in which they are convicted by the weightiest proofs of having uttered
calumnies against the innocent, they are believed with greater probability to have invented
false charges of giving up the sacred books, when they are found to have themselves committed
the far more heinous crime of wicked division in the Church. For even, if whatever
imputations they have cast of giving up the sacred books were true, yet they in no wise ought
to have abandoned the society of Christians, who are commended by holy Scripture even
to the ends of the world, on considerations which they have been familiar with, while these
men showed that they were not acquainted with them.</p>

<p>5. Nor would I therefore be understood to urge that ecclesiastical discipline
should be set at naught, and that every one should be allowed to do exactly as he pleased,
without any check, without a kind of healing chastisement, a lenity which should inspire
fear, the severity of love. For then what will become of the precept of the apostle, "Warn
them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all
men; see that none render evil for evil unto any man?"2338 At any rate, when he added these
last words, "See that none render evil for evil unto any man," he showed with sufficient
clearness that there is no rendering of evil for evil when one chastises those that are unruly,
even though for the fault of unruliness be administered the punishment of chastising. The
punishment of chastising therefore is not an evil, though the fault be an evil. For indeed it
is the steel, not of an enemy inflicting a wound, but of a surgeon performing an operation.
Things like this are done within the Church, and that spirit of gentleness within its pale
burns with zeal towards God, lest the chaste virgin which is espoused to one husband, even
Christ, should in any of her members be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ,
as Eve was beguiled by the subtilty of the serpent.2339 Notwithstanding, far be it from the
servants of the father of the family that they should be unmindful of the precept of their
Lord, and be so inflamed with the fire of holy indignation against the multitude of the tares,
that while they seek to gather them in bundles before the time, the wheat should be rooted
up together with them. And of this sin these men would be held to be guilty, even though
they showed that those were true charges which they brought against the traditors whom
they accused; because they separated themselves in a spirit of impious presumption, not
only from the wicked, whose society they professed to be avoiding, but also from the good
and faithful in all nations of the world, to whom they could not prove the truth of what they
said they knew; and with themselves they drew away into the same destruction many others
over whom they had some slight authority, and who were not wise enough to understand
that the unity of the Church dispersed throughout the world was on no account to be forsaken
for other men’s sins. So that, even though they themselves knew that they were pressing
true charges against certain of their neighbors, yet in this way a weak brother, for whom
Christ died, was perishing through their knowledge;2340 whilst, being offended at other
men’s sins, he was destroying in himself the blessing of peace which he had with the good
brethren, who partly had never heard such charges, partly had shrunk from giving hasty
credence to what was neither discussed nor proved, partly, in the peaceful spirit of humility,
had left these charges, whatsoever they might be, to the cognizance of the judges of the
Church, to whom the whole matter had been referred, across the sea.</p>

<p>6. Do you, therefore, holy scions of our one Catholic mother, beware with
all the watchfulness of which you are capable, in due submission to the Lord, of the example
of crime and error such as this. With however great light of learning and of reputation he
may shine, however much he may boast himself to be a precious stone, who endeavors to
lead you after him, remember always that that brave woman who alone is lovely only to her
husband, whom holy Scripture portrays to us in the last chapter of the Book of Proverbs, is
more precious than any precious stones. Let no one say, I will follow such an one, for it was
even he that made me a Christian; or, I will follow such an one, for it was even he that baptized
me. For "neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that
giveth the increase."2341 And "God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God,
and God in him."2342 No one also that preaches the name of Christ, and handles or administers
the sacrament of Christ, is to be followed in opposition to the unity of Christ. "Let
every man prove his own work; and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not
in another. For every man shall bear his own burden,"2343—the burden, that is, of rendering
an account; for "every one of shall give an account of himself. Let us not therefore judge
one another any more."2344 For, so far as relates to the burdens of mutual love, "bear ye
one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. For if a man think himself to be
something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."2345 Let us therefore "forbear one
another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;"2346 for
no one who gathers outside that peace is gathering with Christ; but "he that gathering not
with Him scattereth abroad."2347</p>

<p>7. Furthermore, whether concerning Christ, or concerning His Church,
or any other matter whatsoever which is connected with your faith and life, to say nothing
of ourselves, who are by no means to be compared with him who said, "Though we," at any
rate, as he went on to say, "Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you
than that which" ye have received in the lawful and evangelical Scripture, "let him be accursed."
2348 While carrying out this principle of action in our dealings with you, and with
all whom we desire to gain in Christ, and, amongst other things, while preaching the holy
Church which we read of as promised in the epistles of God, and see to be fulfilled according
to the promises in all nations of the world, we have earned, not the rendering of thanks, but
the flames of hatred, from those whom we desire to have attracted into His most peaceful
bosom; as though we had bound them fast in that party for which they cannot find any defense
that they should make; or as though we so long before had given injunctions to
prophets and apostles that they should insert in their books no proofs by which it might be
shown that the party of Donatus was the Church of Christ. And we indeed, dear brethren,
when we hear false charges brought against us by those whom we have offended by
preaching the eloquence of truth, and confuting the vanity of error, have, as you know, the
most abundant consolation. For if, in the matters which they lay to my charge, the testimony
of my conscience does not stand against me in the sight of God, where no mortal eye can
reach, not only ought I not to be cast down, but I should even rejoice and be exceeding glad,
for great is my reward in heaven.2349 For in fact I ought to consider, not how bitter, but
how false is what I hear, and how true He is in defense of whose name I am exposed to it,
and to whom it is said, "Thy name is as ointment poured forth."2350 And deservedly does
it smell sweet in all nations, though those who speak evil of us endeavor to confine its fragrance
within one corner of Africa. Why therefore should we take amiss that we are reviled
by men who thus detract from the glory of Christ, whose party and schism find offense in
what was foretold so long before of His ascent into the heavens, and of the pouring forth of
His name, as of the savor of ointment: "Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let
Thy glory be above all the earth"?2351</p>

<p>8. Whilst we bear the testimony of God to this and the like effect against
the vain speaking of men, we are forced to undergo bitter insults from the enemies of the
glory of Christ. Let them say what they will, whilst He exhorts us, saying, "Blessed are they
which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed
are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against
you falsely for my sake." What He says in the first instance, "for righteousness’ sake," He
has repeated in the words that He uses afterwards, "for my sake;" seeing that He "is made
unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption, that, according as
it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."2352 And when He says, "Rejoice,
and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven,"2353 if I hold in a good conscience
what is said "for righteousness’ sake," and "for my sake," whosoever willfully detracts from
my reputation is against his will contributing to my reward. For neither did He only instruct
me by His word, without also confirming me by His example. Follow the faith of the holy
Scriptures, and you will find that Christ rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, sitteth
at the right hand of the Father. Follow the charges brought by His enemies, and you will
presently believe that He was stolen from the sepulchre by His disciples. Why then should
we, while defending His house to the best of the abilities given us by God, expect to meet
with any other treatment from His enemies? "If they have called the Master of the house
Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of His household?"2354 If, therefore, we
suffer, we shall also reign with Him. But if it be not only the wrath of the accuser that strikes
the ear, but also the truth of the accusation that stings the conscience, what does it profit
me if the whole world were to exalt me with perpetual praise? So neither the eulogy of him
who praises has power to heal a guilty conscience, nor does the insult of him, who reviles
wound the good conscience. Nor, however, is your hope which is in the Lord deceived,
even though we chance to be in secret what our enemies wish us to be thought; for you have
not placed your hope in us, nor have you ever heard from us any doctrine of the kind. You
therefore are safe, whatever we may be, who have learned to say, "I have trusted in the Lord;
therefore I shall not slide;"2355 and "In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what
man can do unto me."2356 And to those who endeavor to lead you astray to the earthly
heights of proud men, you know how to answer, "In the Lord put I my trust: how say ye to
my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?"2357</p>

<p>9. Nor is it only you that are safe, whatever we may be, because you are
satisfied with the very truth of Christ which is in us, in so far as it is preached through us,
and everywhere throughout the world, and because, listening to it willingly, so far as it is
set forth by the humble ministry of our tongue, you also think well and kindly of us,—for
so your hope is in Him whom we preach to you out of His loving-kindness, which extends
over you,—but further, all of you, who also received the sacrament of holy baptism from
our ministering, may well rejoice in the same security, seeing that you were baptized, not
into us, but into Christ. You did not therefore put on us, but Christ; nor did I ask you
whether you were converted unto me, but unto the living God; nor whether you believed
in me, but in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. But if you answered my question
with truthful hearts, you were placed in a state of salvation, not by the putting away of the
filth of the flesh, but by the answer of a good conscience towards God;2358 not by a fellowservant,
but by the Lord; not by the herald, but by the judge. For it is not true, as Petilianus
inconsiderately said, that "the conscience of the giver," or, as he added "the conscience of
him who gives in holiness is what we look for to wash the conscience of the recipient." For
when something is given that is of God, it is given in holiness, even by a conscience which
is not holy. And certainly it is beyond the power of the recipient to discern whether the
said conscience is holy or not holy; but that which is given he can discern with clearness.
That which is known to Him who is ever holy is received with perfect safety, whatever be
the character of the minister at whose hands it is received. For unless the words which are
spoken from Moses’ seat were necessarily holy, He that is the Truth would never have said,
"Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do." But if the men who uttered holy
words were themselves holy, He would not have said, "Do not ye after their works: for they
say, and do not."2359 For it is true that in no way do men gather grapes of thorns, because
grapes never spring from the root of a thorn; but when the shoot of the vine has entwined
itself in a thorn hedge, the fruit which hangs upon it is not therefore looked upon with dread,
but the thorn is avoided, while the grape is plucked.</p>

to you, whatsoever we may be, you are safe, who have God for your Father and His Church

not stand on the right hand; although the chaff may be bruised together with the wheat, it
shall not be gathered into the barn; although the bad fish may swim in company with the

<p>11. Let these things suffice you, my beloved Christian brethren of the
Catholic Church, so far as the present business is concerned; and if you hold fast to this in
Catholic affection, so long as you are one sure flock of the one Shepherd, I am not too much
concerned with the abuse that any enemy may lavish on me, your partner in the flock, or,
at any rate, your watch-dog, so long as he compels me to bark rather in your defense than
in my own. And yet, if it were necessary for the cause that I should enter on my own defense,
I should do so with the greatest brevity and the greatest ease, joining freely with all men in
condemning and bearing witness against the whole period of my life before I received the
baptism of Christ, so far as relates to my evil passions and my errors, lest, in defending that
period, I should seem to be seeking my own glory, not His, who by His grace delivered me
even from myself. Wherefore, when I hear that life of mine abused, in whatever spirit he
may be acting who abuses it, I am not so thankless as to be grieved. However much he finds
fault with any vice of mine, I praise him in the same degree as my physician. Why then
should I disturb myself about defending those past and obsolete evils in my life, in respect
of which, though Petilianus has said much that is false, he has yet left more that is true unsaid?
But concerning that period of my life which is subsequent to my baptism, to you who
know me I speak unnecessarily in telling of those things which might be known to all
mankind; but those who know me not ought not to act with such unfairness towards me as
to believe Petilianus rather than you concerning me. For if one should not give credence
to the panegyrics of a friend, neither should one believe the detraction of an enemy. There
remain, therefore, those things which are hidden in a man, in which conscience alone can
bear testimony, which cannot be a witness before men. Herein Petilianus says that I am a
Manichæan, speaking of the conscience of another man; I, speaking of my own conscience,
aver that I am not. Choose which of us you had sooner believe. Notwithstanding, since
there is not any need even of this short and easy defense on my part, where the question at
issue is not concerning the merits of any individual, whoever he may be, but concerning
the truth2360 of the whole Church, I have more also to say to any of you, who, being of the
party of Donatus, have read the evil words which Petilianus has written about me, which I
should not have heard from him if I had had no care about the loss of your salvation; but
then I should have been wanting in the bowels of Christian love.</p>

<p>12. What wonder is it then, if, when I draw in the grain that has been
shaken forth from the threshing-floor of the Lord, together with the soil and chaff, I suffer
injury from the dust that rebounds against me; or that, when I am diligently seeking after
the lost sheep of my Lord, I am torn by the briars of thorny tongues? I entreat you, lay aside
for a time all considerations of party feeling, and judge with some degree of fairness between
Petilianus and myself. I am desirous that you should be acquainted with the cause of the
Church; he, that you should be familiar with mine. For what other reason than because he
dares not bid you disbelieve my witnesses, whom I am constantly citing in the cause of the
Church,—for they are prophets and apostles, and Christ Himself, the Lord of prophets and
apostles,—whereas you easily give him credit in whatever he may choose to say concerning
me, a man against a man, and one, moreover, of your own party against a stranger to you?
And should I adduce any witnesses to my life, however important the thing he might say
would be, it would not be believed by them, and of this Petilianus would quickly persuade
you; especially when any one would bring forward a plea for me. Since he is an enemy of
the Donatist party, in virtue of this fact he would also continually be considered your enemy.
Petilianus therefore reigns supreme. Whenever he aims any abuse at me, of whatever
character it may be, you all applaud and shout assent. This cause he has found wherein the
victory is possible for him, but only with you for judges. He will seek for neither proof nor
witness; for all that he has to prove in his words is this, that he lavishes most copious abuse
on one whom you most cordially hate. For whereas, when the testimony of divine Scripture
is quoted in such abundance and in such express terms in favor of the Catholic Church, he
remains silent amidst your grief, he has chosen for himself a subject on which he may speak
amidst applause from you; and though really conquered, yet, pretending that he stands unmoved,
he may make statements concerning me like this, and even worse than this. It is
enough for me,2361 in respect of the cause which I am now pleading, that whatsoever I may
be found to be, yet the Church for which I speak unconquered.</p>

<p>13. For I am a man of the threshing-floor of Christ: if a bad man, then
part of the chaff; if good, then of the grain. The winnowing-fan of this threshing-floor is
not the tongue of Petilianus; and hereby, whatever evil he may have uttered, even with truth,
against the chaff of this threshing-floor, this in no way prejudices its grain. But whereinsoever
he has cast any revilings or calumnies against the grain itself, its faith is tried on earth, and
its reward increased in the heavens. For where men are holy servants of the Lord, and are
fighting with holiness for God, not against Petilianus, or any flesh and blood like him, but
against principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world,2362 such as
are all enemies of the truth, to whom I would that we could say, "Ye were sometime darkness,
but now are ye light in the Lord,"2363—where the servants of God, I say, are waging such a
war as this, then all the calumnious revilings that are uttered by their enemies, which cause
an evil report among the malicious and those that are rash in believing, are weapons on the
left hand: it is with such as these that even the devil is defeated. For when we are tried by
good report, whether we resist the exaltation of ourselves to pride, and are tried by evil report,
whether we love even those very enemies by whom it is invented against us, then we overcome
the devil by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left. For when the
apostle had used the expression, "By the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on
the left," he at once goes on to say, as if in explanation of the terms, "By honor and dishonor,
by evil report and good report,"2364 and so forth,—reckoning honor and good report among
the armor on the right hand, dishonor and evil report among that upon the left.</p>

<p>14. If, therefore, I am a servant of the Lord, and a soldier that is not reprobate,
with whatever eloquence Petilianus stands forth reviling me, ought I in any way to
be annoyed that he has been appointed for me as a most accomplished craftsman of the armor
on the left? It is necessary that I should fight in this armor as skillfully as possible in defence
of my Lord, and should smite with it the enemy against whom I wage an unseen fight, who
in all cunning strives and endeavors, with the most perverse and ancient craftiness, that this
should lead me to hate Petilianus, and so be unable to fulfill the command which Christ has
given, that we should "love our enemies."2365 But from this may I be saved by the mercy of
Him who loved me, and gave Himself for me, so that, as He hung upon the cross, He said,
"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do;"2366 and so taught me to say of
Petilianus and all other enemies of mine like him "Father, forgive them; for they know not
what they do.’</p>

<p>15. Furthermore, if I have obtained from you, in accordance with my
earnest endeavors, that, laying aside from your minds all prejudice of party, you should be
impartial judges between Petilianus and myself, I will show to you that he has not replied
to what I wrote, that you may understand that he has been compelled by lack of truth to
abandon the dispute, and also see what revilings he has allowed himself to utter against the
man who so conducted it that he had no reply to make. And yet what I am going to say
displays itself with such manifest clearness, that, even though your minds were estranged
from me by party prejudice and personal hatred, yet, if you would only read what is written
on both sides, you could not but confess among yourselves, in your inmost hearts, that I
have spoken truth.</p>
<p>16. For, in replying to the former part of his writings, which then alone had come into
my hands, without taking any notice of his wordy and sacrilegious revilings, where he says,
"Let those men cast in our teeth our twice-repeated baptism, who, under the name of baptism,
have polluted their souls with a guilty washing; whom I hold to be so obscene that no
manner of filth is less clean than they; whose lot it has been, by a perversion of cleanliness,
to be defiled by the water wherein they washed;" I thought that what follows was worthy of
discussion and refutation, where he says, "For what we look for is the conscience of the giver,
that the conscience of the recipient may thereby be cleansed;" and I asked what means were
to be found for cleansing one who receives baptism when the conscience of the giver is
polluted, without the knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament at his hands.2367</p>

<p>17. Read now the most profuse revilings which he has poured forth whilst
puffed up with indignation against me, and see whether he has given me any answer, when
I ask what means are to be found for cleansing one who receives baptism when the conscience
of the giver is polluted, without the knowledge of him who receives the sacrament at his
hands. I beg of you to search minutely, to examine every page, to reckon every line, to
ponder every word, to sift the meaning of each syllable, and tell me, if you can discover it,
where he has made answer to the question, What means are to be found for cleansing the
conscience of the recipient who is unaware that the conscience of the giver is polluted?</p>
<p>18. For how did it bear upon the point that he added a phrase which he said was suppressed
by me, maintaining that he had written in the following terms: "The conscience of
him who gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient?"
For to prove to you that it was not suppressed by me, its addition in no way hinders my inquiry,
or makes up the deficiency which was found in him. For in the face of those very
words I ask again, and I beg of you to see whether he has given any answer, If "the conscience
of him who gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,"
what means are to be found for cleansing the conscience of the recipient when the conscience
of the giver is stained with guilt, without the knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament
at his hands? I insist upon an answer being given to this. Do not allow that any one
should be prejudiced by revilings irrelevant to the matter in hand. If the conscience of him
who gives in holiness is what we look for,—observe that I do not say "the conscience of him
who gives," but that I added the words, "of him who gives in holiness,"—if the conscience,
then, of him who gives in holiness is what we look for, what means are to be found for
cleansing one who receives baptism when the conscience of the giver is polluted, without
the knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament at his hands?</p>

with me as a mere dialectician. Nay, let him summon, not me, but the science of dialectics
itself, to the bar of popular opinion as a forger of lies, and let him open his mouth to its
widest against it, with all the noisiest uproar of a special pleader. Let him say whatever he
pleases before the inexperienced, that so the learned may be moved to wrath, while the ignorant
are deceived. Let him call me, in virtue of my rhetoric, by the name of the orator
Tertullus, by whom Paul was accused;2368 and let him give himself the name of Advocate,2369
in virtue of the pleading in which he boasts his former power, and for this reason delude
himself with the notion that he is, or rather was, a namesake of the Holy Ghost. Let him,
with all my heart, exaggerate the foulness of the Manichæans, and endeavor to divert it on
to me by his barking. Let him quote all the exploits of those who have been condemned,
whether known or unknown to me; and let him turn into the calumnious imputation of a
prejudged crime, by some new right entirely his own, the fact that a former friend of mine
there named me in my absence to the better securing of his own defense. Let him read the
titles that have been placed upon my letters by himself or by his friends, as suited their
pleasure, and boast that he has, as it were, involved me hopelessly in their expressions.
When I acknowledge certain eulogies of bread, uttered in all simplicity and merriment, let
him take away my character with the absurd imputations of poisonous baseness and madness.
And let him entertain so bad an opinion of your understanding, as to imagine that he can
be believed when he declares that pernicious love-charms were given to a woman, not only
with the knowledge, but actually with the complicity2370 of her husband. What the man
who was afterwards to ordain me bishop2371 wrote about me in anger, while I was as yet a
priest, he may freely seek to use as evidence against me. That the same man sought and
obtained forgiveness from a holy Council for the wrong he thus had done me, he is equally
at liberty to ignore as being in my favor,—being either so ignorant or so forgetful of Christian
gentleness, and the commandment of the gospel, that he brings as an accusation against
a brother what is wholly unknown to that brother himself, as he humbly entreats that pardon
may in kindness be extended to him.</p>

words, to matters of which he is wholly ignorant, or in which rather he abuses the ignorance
of the mass of those who hear him, and from the confession of a certain woman, that she
had called herself a catechumen of the Manichæans, being already a full member of the
Catholic Church, let him say or write what he pleases concerning their baptism,—not
knowing, or pretending not to know, that the name of catechumen is not bestowed among
them upon persons to denote that they are at some future time to be baptized, but that this
name is given to such as are also called Hearers, on the supposition that they cannot observe
what are considered the higher and greater commandments, which are observed by those
whom they think right to distinguish and honor by the name of Elect. Let him also maintain
with wonderful rashness, either as himself deceived or as seeking to deceive, that I was a
presbyter among the Manichæans. Let him set forth and refute, in whatever sense seems
good to him, the words of the third book of my Confessions, which, both in themselves, and
from much that I have said before and since, are perfectly clear to all who read them. Lastly,
let him triumph in my stealing his words, because I have suppressed two of them, as though

<p>21. Certainly in all these things, as you can learn or refresh your memory
by reading his letter, he has given free scope to the impulse of his tongue, with all the license
of boasting which he chose to use, but nowhere has he told us where means are to be found
for cleansing the conscience of the recipient, when that of the giver has been stained with
sin without his knowing it. But amid all his noise, and after all his noise, serious as it is, too
terrible as he himself supposes it to be, I deliberately, as it is said, and to the purpose,2372
ask this question once again: If the conscience of him who gives in holiness is what we look
for, what means are to be found for cleansing one who receives baptism without knowing
that the conscience of the giver is stained with sin? And throughout his whole epistle I find
nothing said in answer to this question.</p>

<p>22. For perhaps some one of you will say to me, All these things which
he said against you he wished to have force for this purpose, that he might take away your
character, and through you the character of those with whom you hold communion, that
neither they themselves, nor those whom you endeavor to bring over to your communion,
may hold you to be of any further importance. But, in deciding whether he has given no
answer to the words of your epistle, we must look at them in the light of the passage in which
he proposed them for consideration. Let us then do so: let us look at his writings in the
light of that very passage. Passing over, therefore, the passage in which I sought to introduce
my subject to the reader, and to ignore those few prefatory words of his, which were rather
insulting than revelant to the subject under discussion, I go on to say, "He says, ‘What we
look for is the conscience of the giver, to cleanse that of the recipient.’ But supposing the
conscience of the giver is concealed from view, and perhaps defiled with sin, how will it be
able to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, if, as he says, ‘what we look for is the conscience
of the giver, to cleanse that of the recipient?’ For if he should say that it makes no matter
to the recipient what amount of evil may be concealed from view in the conscience of the
giver, perhaps that ignorance may have such a degree of efficacy as this, that a man cannot
be defiled by the guilt of the conscience of him from whom he receives baptism, so long as
he is unaware of it. Let it then be granted that the guilty conscience of his neighbor cannot
defile a man so long as he is unaware of it; but is it therefore clear that it can further cleanse
him from his own guilt? Whence then is a man to be cleansed who receives baptism, when
the conscience of the giver is polluted without the knowledge of him who is to receive it,
especially when he goes on to say, ‘For he who receives faith from the faithless receives not
faith but guilt?’"2373</p>

<p>23. All these statements in my letter Petilianus set before himself for refutation.
Let us see, therefore, whether he has refuted them; whether he has made any answer
to them at all. For I add the words which he calumniously accuses me of having suppressed,
and, having done so, I ask him again the same question in an even shorter form; for by
adding these two words he has helped me much in shortening this proposition. If the conscience
of him who gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse that of the recipient, and
if he who has received his faith wittingly from one that is faithless, receives not faith but
guilt, where shall we find means to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, when he has not
known that the conscience of the giver is stained with guilt, and when he receives his faith
unwittingly from one that is faithless? I ask, where shall we find means to cleanse it? Let
him tell us; let him not pass off into another subject; let him not cast a mist over the eyes of
the inexperienced. To end with, at any rate, after many tortuous circumlocutions have been
interposed and thoroughly worked out, let him at last tell us where we shall find means to
cleanse the conscience of the recipient when the stains of guilt in the conscience of the
faithless baptizer are concealed from view, if the conscience of him who gives in holiness is
what we look for to cleanse that of the recipient, and if he who has received his faith wittingly
from one that is faithless, receives not faith but guilt? For the man in question receives it
from a faithless man who has not the conscience of one who gives in holiness, but a conscience
stained with guilt, and veiled from view. Where then shall we find means to cleanse
his conscience? whence then does he receive his faith? For if he is neither then cleansed,
nor then receives faith, when the faithlessness and guilt of the baptizer are concealed, why,
when these are afterwards brought to light and condemned, is he not then baptized afresh,
that he may be cleansed and receive faith? But if, while the faithlessness and guilt of the
other are concealed, he is cleansed and does receive faith, whence does he obtain his
cleansing, whence does he receive faith, when there is not the conscience of one that gives
in holiness to cleanse the conscience of the recipient? Let him tell us this; let him make
reply to this: Whence does he obtain his cleansing, whence does he receive faith, if the
conscience of him that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the
recipient, seeing that this does not exist, when the baptizer conceals his character of faithlessness
and guilt? To this no answer has been made whatever.</p>

<p>24. But see, when he is reduced to straits in the argument, he again makes
an attack on me full of mist and wind, that the calm clearness of the truth may be obscured;
and through the extremity of his want he becomes full of resources, shown not in saying
what is true, but in unbought empty revilings. Hold fast, with the keenest attention and
utmost perseverance, what he ought to answer,—that is, where means may be found for
cleansing the conscience of the recipient when the stains in that of the giver are con-
cealed,—lest possibly the blast of his eloquence should wrest this from your hands, and you
in turn should be carried away by the dark tempest of his turgid discourse, so as wholly to
fail in seeing whence he has digressed, and to what point he should return; and see where
the man can wander, whilst he cannot stand in the matter which he has undertaken. For
see how much he says, through having nothing that he ought to say. He says "that I slide
in slippery places, but am held up; that I neither destroy nor confirm the objections that I
make; that I devise uncertain things in the place of certainty; that I do not permit my readers
to believe what is true, but cause them to look with increased suspicion on what is doubtful."
He says "that I have the accursed talents of the Academic philosopher Carneades."2374 He
endeavors to insinuate what the Academics think of the falseness or the falsehood of human
sensation, showing in this also that he is wholly without knowledge of what he says. He
declares that "it is said by them that snow is black, whereas it is white; and that silver is black;
and that a tower is round, or free from projections, when it is really angular; that an oar is
broken in the water, while it is whole."2375 And all this because, when he had said that "the
conscience of him that gives," or "of him that gives in holiness, is what we look for to cleanse
the conscience of the recipient," I said in reply, What if the conscience of the giver be hidden
from sight, and possibly be stained with guilt? Here you have his black snow, and black
silver, and his tower round instead of angular, and the oar in the water broken while yet
whole, in that I suggested a state of the case which might be conceived, and could not really
exist, that the conscience of the giver might be hidden from view, and possibly might be
stained with guilt!</p>
<p>25. Then he continues in the same strain, and cries out: "What is that what if? what is
that possibly? except the uncertain and wavering hesitation of one who doubts, of whom
your poet says’—
<lg>
<l>‘What if I now return to those who say, What if the sky should fall?’"2376</l>

<note type="footnote">2374 Lactantius, Divin. Instit. Book V. c. xv., tells us of the talents of Carneades, recording that when he was
sent on an embassy to Rome by the Athenians, he spoke there first in defense of justice, and then on the following
day in opposition to it; and that he was in the habit of speaking with such force on either side, as to be able to
refute any arguments advanced by anybody else.</note>

<p>Does he mean that when I said, What if the conscience of the giver be hidden from
sight, and possibly be stained with guilt? that it is much the same as if I had said, What if
the sky should fall? There certainly is the phrase What if, because it is possible that it may
be hidden from view, and it is possible that it may not. For when it is not known what the
giver is thinking of, or what crime he has committed, then his conscience is certainly hidden
from the view of the recipient; but when his sin is plainly manifest, then it is not hidden. I
used the expression, And possibly may be stained with guilt, because it is possible that it
may be hidden from view and yet be pure; and again, it is possible that it may be hidden
from view and be stained with guilt. This is the meaning of the What if; this the meaning
of the Possibly. Is this at all like "What if the sky should fall?" O how often have men been
convicted, how often have they confessed themselves that they had consciences stained with
guilt and adultery, whilst men were unwittingly baptized by them after they were degraded
by the sin subsequently brought to light, and yet the sky did not fall! What have we here to
do with Pilus and Furius,2377 who defended the cause of injustice against justice? What
have we here to do with the atheist Diagoras,2378 who denied that there was any God, so
that he would seem to be the man of whom the prophet spoke beforehand, "The fool hath
said in his heart there is no God?"2379 What have we here to do with these? Why were their
names brought in, except that they might make a diversion in favor of a man who had
nothing to say? that while he is at any rate saying something, though needlessly, about these,
the matter in hand may seem to be progressing, and an answer may be supposed to be made
to a question which remains without an answer?</p>

<p>26. Lastly, if these two or three words, What if, and Possibly, are so absolutely
intolerable, that on their account we should have aroused from their long sleep the
Academics, and Carneades, and Pilus, and Furius, and Diagoras, and black snow, and the
falling of the sky, and everything else that is equally senseless and absurd, let them be removed
from our argument. For, as a matter of fact, it is by no means impossible to express what
we desire to say without them. There is quite sufficient for our purpose in what is found a
little later, and has been introduced by himself from my letter: "By what means then is he
to be cleansed who receives baptism when the conscience of the giver is polluted, and that
without the knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament?"2380 Do you acknowledge
that here there is no What if, no Possibly? Well then, let an answer be given. Give close
heed, lest he be found to answer this in what follows. "But," says he, "I bind you in your
cavilling to the faith of believing, that you may not wander further from it. Why do you
turn away your life from errors by arguments of folly? Why do you disturb the system of
belief in respect of matters without reason? By this one word I bind and convince you." It
was Petilianus that said this, not I. These words are from the letter of Petilianus; but from
that letter, to which I just now added the two words which he accuses me of having suppressed,
showing that, notwithstanding their addition, the pertinency of my question, to
which he makes no answer, remains with greater brevity and simplicity. It is beyond dispute
that these two words are, In holiness, and Wittingly: so that it should not be, "The conscience
of him who gives," but "The conscience of him who gives in holiness;" and that it should not
be, "He who has received his faith from one that is faithless," but "He who has wittingly received
his faith from one that is faithless." And yet I had not really suppressed these words;
but I had not found them in the copy which was placed in my hands. It is possible enough
that it was incorrect; nor indeed is it wholly beyond the possibility of belief that even by this
suggestion Academic grudge should be roused against me, and that it should be asserted
that, in declaring the copy to be incorrect, I had said much the same sort of thing as if I had
declared that snow was black. For why should I repay in kind his rash suggestion, and say
that, though he pretends that I suppressed the words, he really added them afterwards
himself, since the copy, which is not angry, can confirm that mark of incorrectness, without
any abusive rashness on my part?</p>

<p>27. And, in the first place, with regard to that first expression, "Of him
who gives in holiness," it does not interfere in the least with my inquiry, by which he is so
much distressed, whether I use the expression, "If the conscience of him that gives is what
we look for," or the fuller phrase, "If the conscience of him that gives in holiness is what we
look for, to cleanse the conscience of the recipient," by what means then is he to be cleansed
who receives baptism if the conscience of the giver is polluted, without the knowledge of
him who is to receive the sacrament? And with regard to the other word that is added,
"wittingly," so that the sentence should not run, "He who has received his faith from one
that is faithless," but "He who has wittingly received his faith from one that is faithless, receives
not faith but guilt," I confess that I had said some things as though the word were
absent, but I can easily afford to do without them; for they caused more hindrance to the
facility of my argument than they gave assistance to its power. For how much more readily,
how much more plainly and shortly, can I put the question thus: "If the conscience of him
who gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient," and "if
he who has wittingly received his faith from one that is faithless receives not faith but guilt,"
by what means is he cleansed, from whom the stain on the conscience of him who gives,
but not in holiness, is hidden? and whence does he receive true faith, who is baptized unwittingly
by one that is faithless? Let it be declared whence this shall be, and then the whole
theory of baptism will be disclosed; then all that is matter of investigation will be brought
to light,—but only if it be declared, not if the time be consumed in evil-speaking.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
<pb n="1213"/>
<head>Chapter 24</head>
<p>28. Whatever, therefore, he finds in these two words,—whether he brings
calumnious accusations about their suppression, or boasts of their being added,—you perceive
that it in no way hinders my question, to which he can find no answer that he can make;
and therefore, not wishing to remain silent, he takes the opportunity of making an attack
upon my character,—retiring, I should have said, from the discussion, except that he had
never entered on it. For just as though the question were about me, and not about the truth
of the Church, or of baptism, therefore he says that I, by suppressing these two words, have
argued as though it were no stumblingblock in the way of my conscience, that I have ignored
what he calls the sacrilegious conscience of him who polluted me. But if this were so, the
addition of the word "wittingly," which is thus introduced, would be in my favor, and its
suppression would tell against me. For if I had wished that my defense should be urged on
the ground that I should be supposed to have been unacquainted with the conscience of the
man that baptized me, then I would accept Petilianus as having spoken in my behalf, since
he does not say in general terms, "He that has received his faith from one that is faithless,"
but "He that has wittingly received his faith from one that is faithless, receives not faith but
guilt;" so that hence I might boast that I had received not guilt, but faith, since I could say I
did not receive it wittingly from one that was faithless, but was unacquainted with the conscience
of him that gave it. See, therefore, and reckon carefully, if you can, what an amount
of superfluous words he wastes on the one phrase, "I was unacquainted with" which he declares
that I have used; whereas I never used it at all,—partly because the question under
discussion was not concerning me, so that I should need to use it; partly because no fault
was apparent in him that baptized me, so that I should be forced to say in my defense that
I had been unacquainted with his conscience.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">
<pb n="1214"/>
<head>Chapter 25</head>
<p>29. And yet Petilianus, to avoid answering what I have said, sets before
himself what I have not, and draws men’s attention away from the consideration of his debt,
lest they should exact the answer which he ought to make. He constantly introduces the
expressions, "I have been unacquainted with," "I say," and makes answer, "But if you were
unacquainted with;" and, as though convicting me, so that it should be out of my power to
say, "I was unacquainted with," he quotes Mensurius, Cæcilianus, Macarius, Taurinus, Romanus,
and declares that "they had acted in opposition to the Church of God, as I could not
fail to know, seeing that I am an African, and already well advanced in years," whereas, so
far as I hear, Mensurius died in the unity of the communion of the Church, before the faction
of Donatus separated itself therefrom; whilst I had read the history of Cæcilianus, that they
themselves had referred his case to Constantine, and that he had been once and again acquitted
by the judges whom that emperor had appointed to try the matter, and again a third
time by the sovereign himself, when they appealed to him. But whatever Macarius and
Taurinus and Romanus did, either in their judicial or executive functions, in behalf of unity
as against their pertinacious madness, it is beyond doubt that it was all done in accordance
with the laws, which these same persons made it unavoidable should be passed and put in
force, by referring the case of Cæcilianus to the judgment of the emperor.</p>
<p>30. Among many other things which are wholly irrevelant, he says that "I was so hard
hit by the decision of the proconsul Messianus, that I was forced to fly from Africa." And
in consequence of this falsehood (to which, if he was not the author of it, he certainly lent
malicious ears when others maliciously invented it), how many other falsehoods had he the
hardihood not only to utter, but actually to write with wondrous rashness, seeing that I went
to Milan before the consulship of Banto, and that, in pursuance of the profession of rhetorician
which I then followed, I recited a panegyric in his honor as consul on the first of
January, in the presence of a vast assembly of men; and after that journey I only returned
to Africa after the death of the tyrant Maximus: whereas the proconsul Messianus heard
the case of the Manichæans after the consulship of Banto, as the day of the chronicles inserted
by Petilianus himself sufficiently shows. And if it were necessary to prove this for the satisfaction
of those who are in doubt, or believe the contrary, I could produce many men, illustrious
in their generation, as most sufficient witnesses to all that period of my life.</p>

<p>31. But why do we make inquiry into these points? Why do we both
suffer and cause unnecessary delay? Are we likely to find out by such a course as this what
means we are to use for cleansing the conscience of the recipient, who does not know that
the conscience of the giver is stained with guilt: whence the man is to receive faith who is
unwittingly baptized by one that is faithless?—the question which Petilianus had proposed
to himself to answer in my epistle, then going on to say anything else he pleased except what
the matter in hand required. How often has he said, "If ignorant you were,"—as though I
had said, what I never did say, that I was unacquainted with the conscience of him who
baptized me. And he seemed to have no other object in all that his evil-speaking mouth
poured forth, except that he should appear to prove that I had not been ignorant of the
misdeeds of those among whom I was baptized, and with whom I was associated in communion,
understanding fully, it would seem, that ignorance did not convict me of guilt. See
then that if I were ignorant, as he has repeated so often, beyond all doubt I should be innocent
of all these crimes. Whence therefore should I be cleansed, who am unacquainted with the
conscience of him who gives but not in holiness, so that I may be least ensnared by his offenses?
Whence then should I receive faith, seeing that I was baptized unwittingly by one
that was faithless? For he has not repeated "If ignorant you were" so often without purpose,
but simply to prevent my being reputed innocent, esteeming beyond all doubt that no man’s
innocence is violated if he unwittingly receives his faith from one that is faithless, and is not
acquainted with the stains on the conscience of him that gives, but not in holiness. Let him
say, therefore, by what means such men are to be cleansed, whence they are to receive not
guilt but faith. But let him not deceive you. Let him not, while uttering much, say nothing;
or rather, let him not say much while saying nothing. Next, to urge a point which occurs
to me, and must not be passed over,—if I am guilty because I have not been ignorant, to use
his own phraseology, and I am proved not to have been ignorant, because I am an African,
and already advanced in years, let him grant that the youths of other nations throughout
the world are not guilty, who had no opportunity either from their race, or from that age
you bring against me, of knowing the points that are laid to our charge, be they true, or be
they false; and yet they, if they have fallen into your hands, are rebaptized without any
considerations of such a kind.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">

<head>Chapter 27</head>
<p>32. But this is not what we are now inquiring. Let him rather answer
(what he wanders off into the most irrelevant matters in order to avoid answering) by what
means the conscience of the recipient is cleansed who is unacquainted with the stain on the
conscience of the giver, if the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to
cleanse the conscience of the recipient? and from what source he receive faith who is unwittingly
baptized by one that is faithless, if he that has wittingly received his faith from one
that is faithless receives not faith but guilt? Omitting, therefore, his revilings, which he has
cast at me without any sound consideration, let us still notice that he does not say what we
demand in what follows. But I should like to look at the garrulous mode in which he has
set this forth, as though he were sure to overwhelm us with confusion. "But let us return,"
he says, "to that argument of your fancy, whereby you seem to have represented to yourself
in a form of words the persons you baptize. For since you do not see the truth, it would
have been more seemly to have imagined what was probable." These words of his own,
Petilianus put forth by way of preface, being about to state the words that I had used. Then
he went on to quote: "Behold, you say, the faithless man stands ready to baptize, but he who
is to be baptized knows nothing of his faithlessness." 2381 He has not quoted the whole of
my proposition and question; and presently he begins to ask me in his turn, saying, "Who
is the man, and from what corner has he started up, that you propose to us? Why do you
seem to see a man who is the produce of your imagination, in order to avoid seeing one
whom you are bound to see, and to examine and test most carefully? But since I see that
you are unacquainted with the order of the sacrament, I tell you this as shortly as I can: you
were bound both to examine your baptizer, and to be examined by him." What is it, then,
that we were waiting for? That he should tell us by what means the conscience of the recipient
is to be cleansed, who is unacquainted with the stain on the conscience of him that gives
but not in holiness, and whence the man is to receive not guilt but faith, who has received
baptism unwittingly from one that is faithless. All that we have heard is that the baptizer
ought most diligently to be examined by him who wishes to receive not guilt but faith, that
the latter may make himself acquainted with the conscience of him that gives in holiness,
which is to cleanse the conscience of the recipient. For the man that has failed to make this
examination, and has unwittingly received baptism from one that is faithless, from the very
fact that he did not make the examination, and therefore did not know of the stain on the
conscience of the giver, was incapacitated from receiving faith instead of guilt. Why therefore
did he add what he made so much of adding,—the word wittingly, which he calumniously
accused me of having suppressed? For in his unwillingness that the sentence should run,
"He who has received his faith from one that is faithless, receives not faith but guilt," he
seems to have left some hope to the man that acts unwittingly. But now, when he is asked
<note type="footnote">2381 See Book I. c. 2, 3.</note>

<pb n="1217"/>
whence that man is to receive faith who is baptized unwittingly by one that is faithless, he
has answered that he ought to have examined his baptizer; so that, beyond all doubt, he refuses
the wretched man permission even to be ignorant, by not finding out from what source
he may receive faith, unless he has placed his trust in the man that is baptizing him.</p>

<p>33. This is what we look upon with horror in your party; this is what the
sentence of God condemns, crying out with the utmost truth and the utmost clearness,
"Cursed is every one that trusteth in man."2382 This is what is most openly forbidden by
holy humility and apostolic love, as Paul declares, "Let no man glory in men."2383 This is
the reason that the attack of empty calumnies and of the bitterest invectives grows even
fiercer against us, that when human authority is as it were overthrown, there may remain
no ground of hope for those to whom we administer the word and sacrament of God in
accordance with the dispensation entrusted unto us. We make answer to them: How long
do you rest your support on man? The venerable society of the Catholic Church makes
answer to them: "Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from Him cometh my salvation. He
only is my God and my helper; I shall not be moved."2384 For what other reason have they
had for removing from the house of God, except that they pretended that they could not
endure those vessels made to dishonor, from which the house shall not be free until the day
of judgment? whereas all the time they rather appear, by their deeds and by the records of
the time, to have themselves been vessels of this kind, while they threw the imputation in
the teeth of others; of which said vessels made unto dishonor, in order that no one should
on their account remove in confusion of mind from the great house, which alone belongs
to the great Father of our family, the servant of God, one who was good and faithful, or was
capable of receiving faith in baptism, as I have shown above, expressly says, "Truly my soul
waiteth upon God" (on God, you see, and not on man): "from Him cometh my salvation"
(not from man). But Petilianus would refuse to ascribe to God the cleansing and purifying
of a man, even when the stain upon the conscience of him who gives, but not in holiness,
is hidden from view, and any one receives his faith unwittingly from one that is faithless.
"I tell you this," he says, "as shortly as I can: you were bound both to examine your baptizer,
and to be examined by him."</p>

<p>34. I entreat of you, pay attention to this: I ask where the means shall be
found for cleansing the conscience of the recipient, when he is not acquainted with the stain
upon the conscience of him that gives but not in holiness, if the conscience of him that gives
in holiness is waited for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient? and from what source
he is to receive faith, who is unwittingly baptized by one that is faithless, if, whosoever has
received his faith wittingly from one that is faithless, receives not faith but guilt? and he
answers me, that both the baptizer and the baptized should be subjected to examination.
And for the proof of this point, out of which no question arises, he adduces the example of
John, in that he was examined by those who asked him who he claimed to be,2385 and that
he also in turn examined those to whom he says, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come?"2386 What has this to do with the subject? What has
this to do with the question under discussion? God had vouchsafed to John the testimony
of most eminent holiness of life, confirmed by the previous witness of the noblest prophecy,
both when he was conceived, and when he was born. But the Jews put their question, already
believing him to be a saint, to find out which of the saints he maintained himself to be, or
whether he was himself the saint of saints, that is, Christ Jesus. So much favor indeed was
shown to him, that credence would at once have been given to whatever he might have said
about himself. If, therefore, we are to follow this precedent in declaring that each several
baptizer is now to be examined, then each must also be believed, whatever he may say of
himself. But who is there that is made up of deceit, whom we know that the Holy Spirit
flees from, in accordance with the Scripture,2387 who would not wish the best to be believed
of him, or who would hesitate to bring this about by the use of any words within his reach?
Accordingly, when he shall have been asked who he is, and shall have answered that he is
the faithful dispenser of God’s ordinances, and that his conscience is not polluted with the
stain of any crime, will this be the whole examination, or will there be a further more careful
investigation into his character and life? Assuredly there will. But it is not written that this
was done by those who in the desert of Jordan asked John who he was.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">

<head>Chapter 30</head>
<p>35. Accordingly this precedent is wholly without bearing on the matter
in hand. We might rather say that the declaration of the apostle sufficiently inculcates this
care, when he says, "Let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon,
being found blameless."2388 And since this is done anxiously and habitually in both parties,
by almost all concerned, how comes it that so many are found to be reprobates subsequently
to the time of having undertaken this ministry, except that, on the one hand, human care
is often deceived, and, on the other hand, those who have begun well occasionally deteriorate?
And since things of this sort happen so frequently as to allow no man to hide them or to
forget them, what is the reason that Petilianus now teaches us insultingly, in a few words,
that the baptizer ought to be examined by the candidate for baptism, since our question is,
by what means the conscience of the recipient is to be cleansed, when the stain on the conscience
of him that gives, but not in holiness, has been concealed from view, if the conscience
of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient.
"Since I see," he says, "that you are unacquainted with the order of the sacrament, I tell you
this as shortly as I can: you were bound both to examine your baptizer, and to be examined
by him." What an answer to make! He is surrounded in so many places by such a multitude
of men that have been baptized by ministers who, having in the first instance seemed
righteous and chaste, have subsequently been convicted and degraded in consequence of
the disclosure of their faults: and he thinks that he is avoiding the force of this question, in
which we ask by what means the conscience of the recipient is to be cleansed, when he is
unacquainted with the stain upon the conscience of him that gives but not in holiness, if
the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of
the recipient,—he thinks, I say, that he is avoiding the force of this question, by saying shortly
that the baptizer ought to be examined. Nothing is more unfortunate than not to be consistent
with truth, by which every one is so shut in, that he cannot find a means of escape. We
ask from whom he is to receive faith who is baptized by one that is faithless? The answer
is, "He ought to have examined his baptizer." Is it therefore the case that, since he does not
examine him, and so even unwittingly receives his faith from one that is faithless, he receives
not faith but guilt? Why then are those men not baptized afresh, who are found to have
been baptized by men that are detected and convicted reprobates, while their true character
was yet concealed?</p>

<p>36. "And where," he says, "is the word that I added, wittingly?so that I
did not say, He that has received his faith from one that is faithless; but, He that has received
his faith wittingly from one that is faithless, receives not faith but guilt." He therefore who
received his faith unwittingly from one that was faithless, received not guilt but faith; and
accordingly I ask from what source he has received it? And being thus placed in a strait, he
answers, "He ought to have examined him." Granted that he ought to have done so; but, as
a matter of fact, he did not, or he was not able: what is your verdict about him? Was he
cleansed, or was he not? If he was cleansed, I ask from what source? For the polluted conscience
of him that gave but not in holiness, with which he was unacquainted, could not
cleanse him. But if he was not cleansed, command that he be so now. You give no such
orders, therefore he was cleansed. Tell me by what means? Do you at any rate tell me what
Petilianus has failed to tell. For I propose to you the very same words which he was unable
to answer. "Behold the faithless man stands ready to baptize; but he who is to be baptized
knows nothing of his faithlessness: what do you think that he will receive—faith, or
guilt?"2389 This is sufficient as a constant form of question: answer, or search diligently to
find what he has answered. You will find abuse that has already been convicted. He finds
fault with me, as though in derision, maintaining that I ought to suggest what is probable
for consideration, since I cannot see the truth. For, repeating my words, and cutting my
sentence in two, he says, "Behold, you say, the faithless man stands ready to baptize; but he
who is to be baptized knows nothing of his faithlessness." Then he goes on to ask, "Who is
the man, and from what corner has he started up, that you propose to us?" Just as though
there were some one or two individuals, and such cases were not constantly occurring
everywhere on either side! Why does he ask of me who the man in question is, and from
what corner he has started up, instead of looking round, and seeing that the churches are
few and far between, whether in cities or in country districts, which do not contain men
detected in crimes, and degraded from the ministry? While their true character was concealed,
while they wished to be thought good, though really bad, and to be reputed chaste,
though really guilty of adultery, so long they were involved in deceit; and so the Holy Spirit,
according to the Scripture, was fleeing from them.2390 It is from the crowd, therefore, of
these men who hitherto concealed their character that the faithless man whom I suggested
started up. Why does he ask me whence he started up, shutting his eyes to all this crowd,
from which sufficient noise arises to satisfy the blind, if we take into consideration none
but those who might have been convicted and degraded from their office?</p>

<p>37. What shall we say of what he himself advanced in his epistle, that
"Quodvultdeus, having been convicted of two adulteries, and cast out from among you, was
received by those of our party?"2391 What then (I would speak without prejudice to this
man, who proved his case to be a good one, or at least persuaded men that it was so), when
such men among you, being as yet undetected, administer baptism, what is received at their
hands,—faith, or guilt? Surely not faith, because they have not the conscience of one who
gives in holiness to cleanse the conscience of the recipient. But yet not guilt either, in virtue
of that added word: "For he that has received his faith wittingly from one that is faithless,
receives not faith but guilt." But when men were baptized by those of whom I speak, they
were surely ignorant what sort of men they were. Furthermore, not receiving faith from
their baptizers, who had not the conscience of one that gives in holiness, and not receiving
guilt, because they were baptized not knowing but in ignorance of their faults, they therefore
remained without faith and without guilt. They are not, therefore, in the number of men
of such abandoned character. But neither can they be in the number of the faithful, because,
as they could not receive guilt, so neither could they receive faith from their baptizers. But
we see that they are reputed by you in the number of the faithful, and that no one of you
declares his opinion that they ought to be baptized, but all of you hold valid the baptism
which they have already received. They have therefore received faith; and yet they have not
received it from those who had not the conscience of one that gives in holiness, to cleanse
the conscience of the recipient. Whence then did they receive it? This is the point from
which I make my effort; this is the question that I press most earnestly; to this I do most
urgently demand an answer.</p>

<p>38. See now how Petilianus, to avoid answering this question, or to avoid
being proved to be incapable of answering it, wanders off vainly into irrelevant matter in
abuse of us, accusing us and proving nothing; and when he chances to make an endeavor
to resist, with something like a show of fighting for his cause, he is everywhere overcome
with the greatest ease. But yet he nowhere gives an answer of any kind to this one question
which we ask: If the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse
the conscience of the recipient, by what means is he to be cleansed who received baptism
while the conscience of the giver was polluted, without the knowledge of him who was to
receive it? for in these words, which he quoted from my epistle, he set me forth as asking a
question, while he showed himself as giving no answer. For after saying what I have just
now recited, and when, on being brought into a great strait on every side, he had been
compelled to say that the baptizer ought to be examined by the candidate for baptism, and
the candidate in turn by the baptizer; and when he had tried to fortify this statement by the
example of John, in hopes that he might find auditors either of the greatest negligence or
of the greatest ignorance, he then went on to advance other testimonies of Scripture wholly
irrelevant to the matter in hand, as the saying of the eunuch to Philip, "See, here is water;
what doth hinder me to be baptized?"2392 "inasmuch as he knew," says he, "that those of
abandoned character were prevented;" arguing that the reason why Philip did not forbid
him to be baptized was because he had proved, in his reading of the Scriptures, how far he
believed in Christ,—as though he had prohibited Simon Magus. And again, he urges that
the prophets were afraid of being deceived by false baptism, and that therefore Isaiah said,
"Lying water that has not faith,"2393 as though showing that water among faithless men is
lying; whereas it is not Isaiah but Jeremiah that says this of lying men, calling the people in
a figure water, as is most clearly shown in the Apocalypse.2394 And again, he quotes as
words of David, "Let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head," when David has been
speaking of the flattery of the smooth speaker deceiving with false praise, so as to lead the
head of the man praised to wax great with pride. And this meaning is made manifest by
the words immediately preceding in the same psalm. For he says, "Let the righteous smite
me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me: but the oil of the sinner shall not break
my head."2395 What can be clearer than this sentence? what more manifest? For he declares
that he had rather be reproved in kindness with the sharp correction of the righteous, so
that he may be healed, than anointed with the soft speaking of the flatterer, so as to be puffed
up with pride.</p>

<p>39. Petilianus quotes also the warning of the Apostle John, that we should
not believe every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God,2396 as though this care
should be bestowed in order that the wheat should be separated from the chaff in this present
world before its time, and not rather for fear that the wheat should be deceived by the chaff;
or as though, even if the lying spirit should have said something that was true, it was to be
denied, because the spirit whom we should abominate had said it. But if any one thinks
this, he is mad enough to contend that Peter ought not to have said, "Thou art the Christ,
the Son of the living God,"2397 because the devils had already said something to the same
effect.2398 Seeing, therefore, that the baptism of Christ, whether administered by an unrighteous
or a righteous man, is nothing but the baptism of Christ what a cautious man and
faithful Christian should do is to avoid the unrighteousness of man, not to condemn the
sacraments of God.</p>
<p>40. Assuredly in all these things Petilianus gives no answer to the question, If the conscience
of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,
by what means is he to be cleansed who receives baptism, when the conscience of
the giver is polluted without the knowledge of the proposed recipient? A certain Cyprian,
a colleague of his from Thubursicubur, was caught in a brothel with a woman of most
abandoned character, and was brought before Primianus of Carthage, and condemned.
Now, when this man baptized before he was detected and condemned, it is manifest that
he had not the conscience of one that gives in holiness, so as to cleanse the conscience of
the recipient. By what means then have they been cleansed who at this day, after he has
been condemned, are certainly not washed again? It was not necessary to name the man
save only to prevent Petilianus from repeating, "Who is the man, and from what corner has
he started up, that you propose to us?" Why did not your party examine that baptizer, as
John, in the opinion of Petilianus, was examined? Or was the real fact this, that they examined
him so far as man can examine man, but were unable to find him out, as he long
lay hid with cunning falseness?</p>

<p>Was the water administered by this man not lying? or is the oil of the
fornicator not the oil of the sinner? or must we hold what the Catholic Church says, and
what is true, that that water and that oil are not his by whom they were administered, but
His whose name was then invoked? Why did they who were baptized by that hypocrite,
whose sins were concealed, fail to try the spirit, to prove that it was not of God? For the
Holy Spirit of discipline was even then fleeing from the hypocrite.2399 Was it that He was
fleeing from him, but at the same time not deserting His sacraments, though ministered by
him? Lastly, since you do not deny that those men have been already cleansed, whom you
take no care to have cleansed now that he is condemned, see whether, after shedding over
the subject so many mists in so many different ways, Petilianus, after all, in any place gives
any answer to the question by what means these men have been cleansed, if what we look
for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient is the conscience of one that gives in holiness,
such as the man who was secretly unclean could not have had.</p>
<p>41. Making then, no answer to this which is so urgently asked of him, and, in the next
place, even seeking for himself a latitude of speech, he says, "since both prophets and apostles
have been cautious enough to fear these things, with what face do you say that the baptism
of the sinner is holy to those who believe with a good conscience?" Just as though I or any
Catholic maintained that that baptism was of the sinner which is administered or received
with a sinner to officiate, instead of being His in virtue of belief in whose name the candidate
is baptized! Then he goes off to an invective against the traitor Judas, saying against him
whatever he can, quoting the testimony of the prophets uttered concerning him so long a
time before, as though he would steep the Church of Christ dispersed throughout the world,
whose cause is involved in this discussion, in the impiety of the traitor Judas,—not considering
what this very thing should have recalled to his mind, that we ought no more to doubt
that that is the Church of Christ which is spread abroad throughout the world, since this
was prophesied with truth so many years before, than we ought to doubt that it was necessary
that Christ should be betrayed by one of His disciples, because this was prophesied in like
manner.</p>

<p>42. But after this, when Petilianus came to that objection of ours, that
they allowed the baptism of the followers of Maximianus, whom they had condemned,
2400—although in the statement of this question he thought it right to use his own
words rather than mine; for neither do we assert that the baptism of sinners is of profit to
us, seeing that we maintain it to belong not only to no sinners, but to no men whatsoever,
in that we are satisfied that it is Christ’s alone,—having put the question in this form, he
says, "Yet you obstinately aver that it is right that the baptism of sinners should be of profit
to you, because we too, according to your statement, maintained the baptism of criminals
whom we justly condemned." When he came to this question, as I said before, even all the
show of fight which he had made deserted him. He could not find any way to go, any means
of escape, any path by which, either through subtle watching or bold enterprise, he could
either secretly steal away, or sally forth by force. "Although this," he says, "I will demonstrate
in my second book, how great the difference is between those of our party and those of
yours whom you call innocent, yet, in the meantime, first extricate yourselves from the offenses
with which you are acquainted in your colleagues, and then seek out the mode of
dealing with those whom we cast out." Would any one, any man upon the earth, give an
answer like this, save one who is setting himself against the truth, against which he cannot
find any answer that can be made? Accordingly, if we too were to use the same words: In
the meantime, first extricate yourselves from the offenses with which you are acquainted in
your colleagues, and then bring up against us any charge connected with those whom you
hold to be wicked amongst us,—what is the result? Have we both won the victory, or are
we both defeated? Nay, rather He has gained the victory for His Church and in His Church,
who has taught us in His Scriptures that no man should glory in men, and that he that
glorieth should glory in the Lord. 2401 For behold in our case who assert with the eloquence
of truth that the man who believes is not justified by him by whom he is baptized, but by
Him of whom it is written, "To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his
faith is counted for righteousness,"2402 since we do not glory in men, and strive, when we
glory, to glory in the Lord in virtue of His own gift, how wholly safe are we, whatever fault
or charge Petilianus may have been able to prove concerning certain men of our communion!
For among us, whatever wicked men are either wholly undetected, or, being known to certain
persons, are yet tolerated for the sake of the bond of unity and peace, in consideration of
other good men to whom their wickedness is unknown, and before whom they could not
be convicted, in order that the wheat may not be rooted up together with the tares, yet they
so bear the burden of their own wickedness, that no one shares it with them except those

who are pleased with their unrighteousness. Nor indeed have we any apprehension that
those whom they baptize cannot be justified, since they believe in Him that justifieth the
ungodly that their faith may be counted for righteousness.2403</p>

<p>43. Furthermore, according to our tenets, neither he of whom Petilianus
said that he was cast forth by us for the sin of the men of Sodom, another being appointed
in his place, and that afterwards he was actually restored to our college,—talking all the time
without knowing what he was saying,—nor he whom he declares to have been penitent
among you, in whatever degree their respective cases do or do not admit of any defense,
can neither of them prejudice the Church, which is spread abroad throughout all nations,
and increases in the world until the harvest. For if they were really wicked members of it
that you accuse, then they were already not in it, but among the chaff; but if they are good,
while you defame their character with unrighteous accusations, they are themselves being
tried like gold, while you burn after the similitude of chaff. Yet the sins of other men do
not defile the Church, which is spread abroad throughout the whole world, according to
most faithful prophesies, waiting for the end of the world as for its shore, on which, when
it is landed, it will be freed from the bad fish, in company with which the inconvenience of
nature might be borne without sin within the same nets of the Lord, so long as it was not
right to be impatiently separated from them. Nor yet is the discipline of the Church on this
account neglected by constant and diligent and prudent ministers of Christ, in whose
province crimes are in such wise brought to light that they cannot be defended on any plea
of probability. Innumerable proofs of this may be found in those who have been bishops
or clergy of the second degree of orders, and now, being degraded, have either gone abroad
into other lands through shame, or have gone over to you yourselves or to other heresies,
or are known in their own districts; of whom there is so great a multitude dispersed
throughout the earth, that if Petilianus, bridling for a time his rashness in speaking, had
taken them into consideration, he would never have fallen into so manifestly false and
groundless a misconception, as to think that we ought to join in what he says: None of you
is free from guilt, where no one that is guilty is condemned.</p>

it may appear that overseers and ministers are wont to be condemned even in the Catholic
Church,—we need not look far to find the example of Honorius of Milevis. But take the
case of Splendonius, whom Petilianus ordained priest after he had been condemned in the
Catholic Church, and rebaptized by himself, whose condemnation in Gaul, communicated
to us by our brethren, our colleague Fortunatus caused to be publicly read in Constantina,
and whom the same Petilianus afterwards cast forth on experience of his abominable deceit.
From the case of this Splendonius, when was there a time when he might not have been reminded
after what fashion wicked men are degraded from their office even in the Catholic
Church? I wonder on what precipice of rashness his heart was resting when he dictated
those words in which he ventured to say, "No one of you is free from guilt, where no one
that is guilty is condemned." Wherefore the wicked, being bodily intermingled with the
good, but spiritually separated from them in the Catholic Church, both when they are undetected
through the infirmity of human nature, and when they are condemned from considerations
of discipline, in every case bear their own burden. And in this way those are
free from danger who are baptized by them with the baptism of Christ, if they keep free
from share in their sins either by imitation or consent; seeing that in like manner, if they
were baptized by the best of men, they would not be justified except by Him that justifieth
the ungodly: since to those that believe on Him that justifieth the ungodly their faith is
counted for righteousness.</p>

<p>45. But as for you, when the case of the followers of Maximianus is brought
up against you, who, after being condemned by the sentence of a Council of 310 bishops;2404
after being utterly defeated in the same Council, quoted in the records of so many proconsuls,
in the chronicles of so many municipal towns; after being driven forth from the basilicas of
which they were in possession, by the order of the judges, enforced by the troops of the
several cities, were yet again received with all honor by you, together with those whom they
had baptized outside the pale of your communion, without any question respecting their
baptism,—when confronted, I say, with their case, you can find no reply to make. Indeed,
you are vanquished by an expressed opinion, not indeed true, but proceeding from yourselves,
by which you maintain that men perish for the faults of others in the same communion of
the sacraments, and that each man’s character is determined by that of the man by whom
he is baptized,—that he is guilty if his baptizer is guilty, innocent if he is innocent. But if
these views are true, there can be no doubt that, to say nothing of innumerable others, you
are destroyed by the sins of the followers of Maximianus, whose guilt your party, in so large
a Council, has exaggerated even to the proportions of the sin of those whom the earth
swallowed up alive. But if the faults of the followers of Maximianus have not destroyed you,
then are these opinions false which you entertain; and much less have certain indefinite
unproved faults of the Africans been able to destroy the entire world. And accordingly, as
the apostle says, "Every man shall bear his own burden;"2405 and the baptism of Christ is
no one’s except Christ’s; and it is to no purpose that Petilianus promises that he will take
as the subject of his second book the charges which we bring concerning the followers of
Maximianus, entertaining too low an opinion of men’s intellects, as though they do not
perceive that he has nothing to say.</p>

<p>46. For if the baptism which Prætextatus and Felicianus administered in
the communion of Maximianus was their own, why was it received by you in those whom
they baptized as though it were the baptism of Christ? But if it is truly the baptism of Christ,
as indeed it is, and yet could not profit those who had received it with the guilt of schism,
what do you say that you could have granted to those whom you have received into your
body with the same baptism, except that, now that the offense of their accursed division is
wiped out by the bond of peace, they should not be compelled to receive the sacrament of
the holy laver as though they had it not, but that, as what they had was before for their destruction,
so it should now begin to be of profit to them? Or if this is not granted to them
in your communion, because it could not possibly be that it should be granted to schismatics
among schismatics, it is at any rate granted to you in the Catholic communion, not that you
should receive baptism as though it were lacking in you, but that the baptism which you
have actually received should be of profit to you. For all the sacraments of Christ, if not
combined with the love which belongs to the unity of Christ, are possessed not unto salvation,
but unto judgment. But since it is not a true verdict, but your verdict, "that through the
baptism of certain traditors the baptism of Christ has perished from the world in general,"
it is with good reason that you cannot find any answer to make respecting the recognition
of the baptism of the followers of Maximianus.</p>
<p>47. See therefore, and remember with the most watchful care, how Petilianus has made
no answer to that very question, which he proposes to himself in such terms as to seem to
make it a starting-point from which to say something. For the former question he has dismissed
altogether, and has not wished to speak of it to us, because I suppose it was beyond
his power; nor is he at any time, up to the very end of his volume, going to say anything
about it, though he quoted it from the first part of my epistle as though it were a matter
calling for refutation. For even though he has added the two words which he accused me
of having suppressed, as though they were the strongest bulwarks of his position, he yet lies
wholly defenseless, unable to find any answer to make when he is asked, If the conscience
of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,
where are we to find means for cleansing the conscience of the man who is unacquainted
with the conscience of him gives, but not in holiness? and if it be the case that any one who
has received his faith from one that is faithless, receives not faith but guilt, from what source
is he to receive not guilt but faith, who is unwittingly baptized by one that is faithless? To
this question it has long been manifest from what he says that he has made no answer.</p>
<p>48. In the next place, he has gone on, with calumnious mouth, to abuse monasteries
and monks, finding fault also with me, as having been the founder of this kind of life.2406
And what this kind of life really is he does not know at all, or rather, though it is perfectly
<note type="footnote">2406 See Possidius’ Life of St. Augustin, cc. v.-xi.</note>

<pb n="1232"/>
well known throughout all the world, he pretends that he is unacquainted with it. Then,
asserting that I had said that Christ was the baptizer, he has also added certain words from
my epistle as though I had set this forth as my own sentiment, when I had really quoted it
as his and yours, and it was inveighed against with most copious harshness, as if it were I
who had said these things against myself, when what he reprehended was not mine, but his
and your sentiment, as I will presently show clearly to the best of my ability.2407 Then he
has endeavored to show us, in many unnecessary words, that Christ does not baptize, but
that baptism is administered in His name, at once in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost; of which Trinity itself he has said, either because it was what he
wished, or because it was all that he could say, that "Christ is the centre of the Trinity." In
the next place, he has taken occasion of the names of the sorcerers Simon and Barjesus to
vent against us what insults he thought fit. Then he goes on, keeping in guarded suspense
the case of Optatus of Thamugas, that he might not be steeped in the odium that arose from
it, denying that neither he or his party could have passed judgment upon him, and actually
intimating in respect of him, that he was crushed in consequence of suggestions from myself.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="41">

<head>Chapter 41</head>
<p>49. Lastly, he has ended his epistle with an exhortation and warning to
his own party, that they should not be deceived by us, and with a lamentation over those of
our party, that we had made them worse than they had been before. Having therefore
carefully considered and discussed these points, as appears with sufficient clearness from
the words of the epistle which he wrote, Petilianus has made no answer at all to the position
which I advanced to begin with in my epistle, when I asked, Supposing it to be true, as he
asserts, that the conscience of one that gives—or rather, to add what he considers so great
a support to his argument—that the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look
for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, by what means he who receives baptism is to
be cleansed, when, if the conscience of the giver is polluted, it is without the knowledge of
the proposed recipient? Whence it is not surprising that a man resisting in the cause of
falsehood, pressed hard in the straits of the truth that contradicts it, should have chosen
rather to gasp forth mad abuse, than to walk in the path of that truth which cannot be
overcome.</p>
<p>50. And now I would beg of you to pay especial attention to the next few words, that I
may show you clearly what he has been afraid of in not answering this, and that I may bring
into the light what he has endeavored to shroud in obscurity. It certainly was in his power,
when we asked by what means he is to be cleansed, who receives baptism when the conscience
of the giver is polluted without the knowledge of the proposed recipient, to answer with the
greatest ease, From our Lord God; and at any rate to say with the utmost confidence, God
wholly cleanses the conscience of the recipient, when he is unacquainted with the stain upon
the conscience of him that gives but not in holiness. But when a man had already been
compelled by the tenets of your sect to rest the cleansing of the recipient on the conscience
of the giver, in that he had said, "For the conscience of him that gives," or "of him that gives
in holiness, is looked for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient," he was naturally afraid
lest any one should seem to be better baptized by a wicked man who concealed his wickedness,
than by one that was genuinely and manifestly good; for in the former case his
cleansing would depend not on the conscience of one that gave in holiness, but on the most
excellent holiness of God Himself. With this apprehension, therefore, that he might not be
involved in so great an absurdity, or rather madness, as not to know where he could make
his escape, he was unwilling to say by what means the conscience of the recipient should be
cleansed, when he does not know of the stain upon the conscience of him that gives but not
in holiness; and he thought it better, by making a general confusion with his quarrelsome
uproar, to conceal what was asked of him, than to give a reply to his question, which should
at once discomfit him; never, however, thinking that our letter could be read by men of such
good understanding, or that his would be read by those who had read ours as well, to which
he has professed to make an answer.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="42">
<pb n="1234"/>
<head>Chapter 42</head>
<p>51. For what I just now said is put with the greatest clearness in that very
epistle of mine, in answering which he has said nothing; and I would beg of you to listen
for a few moments to what he there has done. And although you are partisans of his, and
hate us, yet, if you can, bear it with equanimity. For in his former epistle, to the first portion
of which—the only portion which had then come into our hands—I had in the first instance
made my reply, he had so rested the hope that is found in baptism in the baptizer, as to say,
"For everything consists of an origin and root; and if anything has not a head, it is nothing."
Since then Petilianus had said this, not wishing anything to be understood by the origin and
root and head of baptizing a man, except the man by whom he might be baptized, I made
a comment, and said "We ask, therefore, in a case where the faithlessness of the baptizer is
undetected, if then the man whom he baptizes receives faith and not guilt? if then the baptizer
is not his origin and root and head, who is it from whom he receives faith? where is the
origin from which he springs? where is the root of which he is a shoot? where the head which
is his starting-point? Can it be that, when he who is baptized is unaware of the faithlessness
of his baptizer, it is then Christ who is the origin and root and head?" This therefore I say
and exclaim now also, as I did there as well: "Alas for human rashness and conceit! Why
do you not allow that it is always Christ who gives faith, for the purpose of making a man
a Christian by giving it? Why do you not allow that Christ is always the origin of the
Christian, that the Christian always plants his root in Christ, that Christ is the Head of the
Christian? Will it then be urged that, even where spiritual grace is dispensed to those that
believe by the hands of a holy and faithful minister, it is still not the minister himself who
justifies, but that One of whom it is said, ‘He justifieth the ungodly’?2408 But unless we admit
this, either the Apostle Paul was the head and origin of those whom he had planted, or
Apollos the root of those whom he had watered, rather than He who had given them faith
in briefing; whereas the same Paul says, ‘I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the
increase. So that neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that
giveth the increase.’2409 Nor was the apostle himself their root, but rather He who says, ‘I
am the vine, ye are the branches.’2410 How, too, could he be their head, when he says that
‘we, being many, are one body in Christ,’2411 and expressly declares in many passages that
Christ Himself is the Head of the whole body? Wherefore, whether a man receives the sacrament
of baptism from a faithful or a faithless minister his whole hope is in Christ, that he
fall not under the condemnation, that ‘Cursed is he that placeth his hope in man!’"2412</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="43">
<pb n="1235"/>
<head>Chapter 43</head>
<p>52. These things, I think, I put with clearness and truth in my former
epistle, when I made answer to Petilianus. These things I have also now quoted, intimating
and commending to you the truth that our faith rests on something else altogether than
man, and that we believe that the Lord Christ is the cleanser and the justifier of men that
believe in Him that justifieth the ungodly, that their faith may be counted unto them for
righteousness, whether the man who administers the baptism be righteous, or such an impious
and deceitful man as the Holy Spirit flees. Then I went on to point out what absurdity
would follow were it otherwise, and I said, as I say now: "Otherwise, if each man is born
again in spiritual grace of the same sort as he by whom he is baptized, and if, when he who
baptizes him is manifestly a good man, then he himself gives faith, he is himself the origin
and root and head of him who is being born; whilst, when the baptizer is faithless without
its being known, then the baptized person receives faith from Christ, then derives his origin
from Christ, then he is rooted in Christ then he boasts in Christ as his head; in that case all
who are baptized should wish that they might have faithless baptizers, and be ignorant of
their faithlessness. For however good their baptizers might have been, Christ is certainly
beyond comparison better still, and He will then be the Head of the baptized if the faithlessness
of the baptizer shall escape detection. But if it be perfect madness to hold such a view
(for it is Christ always that justifieth the ungodly, by changing his ungodliness into Christianity;
it is from Christ always that faith is received; Christ is always the origin of the regenerate,
and the Head of the Church), what weight then will those words have, which
thoughtless readers value by their sound, without inquiring what their inner meaning is?"
2413 This much I said at that time; this is written in my epistle.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="44">

<head>Chapter 44</head>
<p>53. Then a little after, as he had said, "This being so, brethren, what perversity
must that be, that he who is guilty by reason of his own faults should make another
free from guilt, whereas the Lord Jesus Christ says, ‘Every good tree bringeth forth good
fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit: do men gather grapes of thorns?’2414 and
again, ‘A good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good things: and
an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things,’"2415—by which words
Petilianus showed with sufficient clearness, that the man who baptizes is to be looked on as
the tree, and he who is baptized as the fruit: to this I had answered, If the good tree is the
good baptizer, and his good fruit he whom he has baptized, then any one who has been
baptized by a bad man, even if his wickedness be not manifest, cannot by any possibility be
good, for he is sprung from an evil tree. For a good tree is one thing; a tree whose quality
is concealed, but yet bad, is another. What else did I wish to be understood by those words,
except what I had stated a little above, that the tree and its fruit do not represent him that
baptizes and him that is baptized; but that the man ought to be received as signified by the
tree, his works and his life by the fruit, which are always good in the good man, and evil in
the evil man, lest this absurdity should follow, that a man should be bad when baptized by
a bad man, even though his wickedness were concealed, being, as it were, the fruit of a tree
whose quality was unknown, but yet bad? To which he has answered nothing whatsoever.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="45">
<pb n="1237"/>
<head>Chapter 45</head>
<p>54. But that neither he nor any one of you might say that, when any one
of concealed bad character is the baptizer, then he whom he baptizes is not his fruit, but the
fruit of Christ, I went on immediately to point out what a foolish error is consequent also
on that opinion; and I repeated, though in other words, what I had said shortly before: If,
when the quality of the tree is concealed, but evil, any one who may have been baptized by
it is born, not of it but of Christ, then they are justified with greater holiness who are baptized
by wicked men, whose wickedness is concealed, than they who are baptized by men that are
genuinely and manifestly good.2416 Petilianus then, being hemmed in by these embarrassing
straits, said nothing about the earlier part on which these remarks depended, and in his
answer so quoted his absurd consequence of his error as though I had stated it as my own
opinion, whereas it was really stated in order that he might perceive the amount of evil
consequent on his opinion, and so be forced to alter it. Imposing, therefore, this deceit on
those who hear and read his words, and never for a moment supposing that what we have
written could be read, he begins a vehement and petulant invective against me, as though I
had thought that all who are baptized ought to wish that they might have as their baptizers
men who are faithless, without knowing this themselves, since, however good the men might
be whom they had to baptize them, Christ is incomparably better, who will then be the head
of the person baptized, if the faithless baptizer conceal his true character. As though, too,
I had thought that those were justified with greater holiness who are baptized by evil men,
whose character is concealed, than those who are baptized by men that are genuinely and
manifestly good; when this marvellous piece of madness was only mentioned by me as following
necessarily on the opinion of those who think with Petilianus, that a man, when
baptized, bears the same relation to his baptizer as fruit does to the tree from which it
springs,—good fruit springing from a good tree, evil fruit from an evil tree,—seeing that
they, when they are bidden by me to answer whose fruit they think a man that is baptized
to be when he is baptized by one of secretly bad character, since they do not venture to rebaptize
him, are compelled to answer, that then he is not the fruit of that man of secretly
bad character, but that he is the fruit of Christ. And so they are followed by a consequence
contrary to their inclination, which none but a madman would entertain,—that if a man is
the fruit of his baptizer when he is baptized by one that is genuinely and manifestly good,
but when he is baptized by one of secretly bad character, he is then not his fruit, but the
fruit of Christ,—it cannot but follow that they are justified with greater holiness who are
baptized by men of secretly bad character, than those who are baptized by men who are
genuinely and manifestly good.</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="46">
<pb n="1238"/>
<head>Chapter 46</head>
<p>55. Now, seeing that when Petilianus attributes this to me as though it
were my opinion, he makes it an occasion for a serious and vehement invective against me,
he at any rate shows, by the very force of his indignation, how great a sin it is in his opinion
to entertain such views; and, accordingly, whatever he has wished it to appear that he said
against me for holding this opinion will be found to have been really said against himself,
who is proved to entertain the view. For he shows herein by how great force on the side of
truth he is overcome, when he cannot find any other door of escape except to pretend that
it was I who entertained the views which really are his own. Just as if those whom the apostle
confutes for maintaining that there was no resurrection from the dead, were to wish to bring
an accusation against the same apostle, on the ground that he said, "Then is Christ not risen,"
and to maintain that the preaching of the apostle was vain, and the faith of those who believed
in it was also vain, and that false witnesses were found against God in those who had said
that He raised up Christ from the dead. This is what Petilianus wished to do to me, never
expecting that any one could read what I had written, which he could not answer, though
very anxious that men should believe him to have answered it. But just as, if any one had
done this to the apostle, the whole calumnious accusation would have recoiled on the head
of those who made it so soon as the entire passage in his epistle was read, and the preceding
words restored, on which any one who reads them must perceive that those which I have
quoted depend, in the same way, so soon as the preceding words of my epistle are restored,
the accusation which Petilianus brings against me is cast back with all the greater force upon
his own head, from which he had striven to remove it.</p>
<p>56. For the apostle, in confuting those who denied that there was any resurrection of
the dead, corrects their view by showing the absurdity which follows those who entertain
this view, however loth they may be to admit the consequence, in order that, while they
shrink in abhorrence from what is impious to say, they may correct what they have ventured
to believe. His argument continues thus: "But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then
is Christ not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is
also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have testified of God
that He raised up Christ; whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not."2417 In
order that, while they fear to say that Christ had not risen, with the other wicked and accursed
conclusions which follow from such a statement, they may correct what they said in a spirit
of folly and infidelity, that there is no resurrection of the dead. If, therefore, you take away
what stands at the head of this argument, "If there be no resurrection of the dead," the rest
is spoken amiss, and yet must be ascribed to the apostle. But if you restore the supposition
on which the rest depends, and place as the hypothesis from which you start, "There is no
resurrection of the dead," then the conclusion will follow rightly, "Then is Christ not risen,
<note type="footnote">2417 1 Cor. xv. 13-15.</note>

<pb n="1239"/>
and our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain," with all the rest that is appended to
it. And all these statements of the apostle are wise and good, since whatever evil they have
in them is to be imputed to those who denied the resurrection of the dead. In the same
manner also, in my epistle, take away my supposition, If every one is born again in spiritual
grace of the same character as he by whom he is baptized, and if, when the man who baptizes
is genuinely and manifestly good, he does of himself give faith, he is the origin and root and
head of him who is being born again; but when the baptizer is a wicked man, and undetected
in his wickedness, then each man who is baptized receives his faith from Christ, derives his
origin from Christ, is rooted in Christ, makes his boast in Christ as his Head:—take away,
I say, this hypothesis, on which all that follows depends, and there remains a saying of the
worst description which must fairly be ascribed to me, viz., that all who are baptized should
desire that they should have faithless men to baptize them, and be ignorant of their faithlessness.
For however good men they may have to baptize them, Christ is incomparably better
who will then be the Head of the baptized, if the baptizer be a faithless man, but undetected.
2418 But let the statements that you make be restored, and then it will forthwith be found
that this which depends upon it and follows in close connection from it is not my sentiment,
and that any evil which it contains is retorted on the opinion which you maintain. In like
manner, take away the supposition, If the good baptizer is the good tree, so that he whom
he has baptized is his good fruit, and if, when the character of an evil tree is concealed, then
any one that has been baptized by it is born, not of it, but of Christ,—take away this hypothesis,
which you were compelled to confess had its origin in your sect and in the letter of
Petilianus, and the mad conclusion which follows from it will be mine, to be ascribed to me
alone, then they are justified with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected evil men,
than they who are baptized by men that are genuinely and manifestly good.2419 But restore
the hypothesis on which this depends, and you will at once see both that I have been right
in making this statement for your correction, and that all that with good reason displeases
you in this opinion has recoiled upon your own head.</p>

<p>57. Furthermore, in like manner as those who denied the resurrection of
the dead could in no way defend themselves from the evil consequences which the apostle
proved to follow from their premises, in order to refute their error, saying, "Then is not
Christ raised," with the other conclusions of similar atrocity, unless they changed their
opinions, and acknowledged that there was a resurrection of the dead; so is it necessary that
you should change your opinion, and cease to rest on man the hope of those who are baptized,
if you do not wish to have imputed to you what we say for your refutation and correction,
that they are justified with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected evil men than
those that are baptized by men that are genuinely and manifestly good. For if you make
your first assertion, see what I say, unless some one shall suppress this a second time, and
make out that I have entertained the opinion which I quote for your refutation and correction.
See what I lay down as my premiss, from which hangs the statement which I shall
subsequently make: If you rest the hope of those who are to be baptized on the man by
whom they are baptized, and if you maintain, as Petilianus wrote, that the man who baptizes
is the origin and root and head of him that is baptized; if you receive as the good tree the
good man who baptizes, and as his good fruit the man who has been baptized by him; then
you put it into our heads to ask from what origin he springs, from what root he shoots up,
to what head he is joined, from what tree he is born, who is baptized by an undetected bad
man? For to this inquiry, belongs also the following, to which I have over and over again
maintained that Petilianus has given no reply: By what means is a man to be cleansed who
receives baptism while he is ignorant of the stain upon the conscience of him that gives but
not in holiness? for this conscience of him that gives, or of him that gives in holiness,
Petilianus wishes to be the origin, root, head, seed, tree from which the sanctification of the
baptized has its existence,—springs, begins, sprouts forth, is born.</p>

<p>58. When we ask, therefore, by what means the man is to be cleansed
whom you do not baptize again in your communion, even when it has been made clear that
he has been baptized by some one who, on account of some concealed iniquity, did not at
the time possess the conscience of one that gives in holiness, what answer do you intend to
make, except that he is cleansed by Christ or by God, although, indeed, Christ is Himself
God over all, blessed for ever,2420 or by the Holy Spirit since He too is Himself God, because
this Trinity of Persons is one God? Whence Peter, after saying to a man, "Thou hast dared
to lie to the Holy Ghost," immediately went on to add what was the nature of the Holy Ghost,
saying, "Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."2421 Lastly, even if you were to say
that he was cleansed and purified by an angel when he is unacquainted with the pollution
in the conscience of him that gives but not in holiness, take notice that it is said of the saints,
when they shall have risen to eternal life, that they shall then be equal to the angels of
God.2422 Any one, therefore, that is cleansed even by an angel is cleansed with greater
holiness than if he were cleansed by any kind of conscience of man. Why then are you unwilling
that it should be said to you, If cleaning is wrought by the hands of a man when he
is genuinely and manifestly good; but when the man is evil, but undetected in his wickedness,
then since he has not the conscience of one that gives in holiness, it is no longer he, but God,
or an angel, that cleanses; therefore they who are baptized by undetected evil men are justified
with greater holiness than those who are baptized by men that are genuinely and manifestly
good? And if this opinion is displeasing to you, as in reality it ought to be displeasing to
every one, then take away the source from which it springs, correct the premiss to which it
is indissolubly bound; for if these do not precede as hypotheses, the other will not follow as
a consequence.</p>

<p>59. Do not therefore any longer say, "The conscience of one that gives in
holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient," lest you be asked,
When a stain on the conscience of the giver is concealed, who cleanses the conscience of
the recipient? And when you shall have answered, Either God or an angel (since there is
no other answer which you possibly can make), then should follow a consequence whereby
you would be confounded: Those then are justified with greater holiness who are baptized
by undetected evil men, so as to be cleansed by God or by an angel, than those who are
baptized by men who are genuinely and manifestly good, who cannot be compared with
God or with the angels. But prevail upon yourselves to say what is said by Truth and by the
Catholic Church, that not only when the minister of baptism is evil, but also when he is holy
and good, hope is still not to be placed in man, but in Him that justifieth the ungodly, in
whom if any man believe, his faith is counted for righteousness.2423 For when we say, Christ
baptizes, we do not mean by a visible ministry, as Petilianus believes, or would have men
think that he believes, to be our meaning, but by a hidden grace, by a hidden power in the
Holy Spirit as it is said of Him by John the Baptist, "The same is He which baptizeth with
the Holy Ghost."2424 Nor has He, as Petilianus says, now ceased to baptize; but He still does
it, not by any ministry of the body, but by the invisible working of His majesty. For in that
we say, He Himself baptizes, we do not mean, He Himself holds and dips in the water the
bodies of the believers; but He Himself invisibly cleanses, and that He does to the whole
Church without exception. Nor, indeed, may we refuse to believe the words of the Apostle
Paul who says concerning Him, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
water by the word."2425 Here you see that Christ sanctifies; here you see that Christ also
Himself washes, Himself purifies with the self-same washing of water by the word, wherein
the ministers are seen to do their work in the body. Let no one, therefore, claim unto himself
what is of God. The hope of men is only sure when it is fixed on Him who cannot deceive,
since "Cursed be every one that trusteth in man,"2426 and "Blessed is that man that maketh
the Lord His trust."2427 For the faithful steward shall receive as his reward eternal life; but
the unfaithful steward, when he dispenses his lord’s provisions to his fellow-servants, must
in no wise be conceived to make the provisions useless by his own unfaithfulness. For the
Lord says, "Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their
works."2428 And this is therefore the injunction that is given us against evil stewards, that

<p>60. But if it is clear that Petilianus has made no answer to those first words
of my epistle, and that, when he has endeavored to make an answer, he has shown all the
more clearly how incapable he was of answering, what shall I say in respect of those portions
of my writings which he has not even attempted to answer, on which he has not touched at
all? And yet if any one shall be willing to review their character, having in his possession
both my writings and those of Petilianus, I think he will understand by what confirmation
they are supported. And that I may show you this as shortly as I can, I would beg you to
call to mind the proofs that were advanced from holy Scripture, or refresh your memory by
reading both what he has brought forward as against me, and what I have brought forward
in my answer as against you, and see how I have shown that the passages which he has
brought forward are antagonistic not to me, but rather to yourselves; whilst he has altogether
failed to touch those which I brought forward as especially necessary, and in that one passage
of the apostle which he has endeavored to make use of as though it favored him, you will
see how he found himself without the means of making his escape.</p>
<p>61. For the portion of this epistle which he wrote to his adherents—from the beginning
down to the passage in which he says, "This is the commandment of the Lord to us, ‘When
they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another;’2429 and if they persecute you in that
also, flee ye to a third"—came first into my hands, and to it I made a reply; and when this
reply of ours had fallen, in turn, into his hands, he wrote in answer to it this which I am
now refuting, showing that he has made no reply to mine. In that first portion, therefore,
of his writings to which I first replied, these are the passages of Scripture which he conceives
to be opposed to us: "Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth
forth evil fruit. Do men gather grapes of thorns?"2430 And again: "A good man, out of the
good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil
treasure, bringeth forth evil things."2431 And again: "When a man is baptized by one that
is dead, his washing profiteth him nothing."2432 From these passages he is anxious to show
that the man who is baptized is made to partake of the character of him by whom he is
baptized; I on the other hand, have shown in what sense these passages should be received,
and that they could in no wise aid his view. But as for the other expressions which he has
used against evil and accursed men, I have sufficiently shown that they are applicable to the
Lord’s wheat, dispersed, as was foretold and promised, throughout the world, and that they
might rather be used by us against you. Examine them again, and you will find it so.</p>

<p>62. But the passages which I have advanced to assert the truth of the Catholic Church,
are the following: As regards the question of baptism, that our being born again, cleansed,
justified by the grace of God, should not be ascribed to the man who administered the sacrament,
I quoted these: "It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man:"2433
and "Cursed be every one that trusteth in man;"2434 and that, "Salvation belongeth unto the
Lord;"2435 and that, "Vain is the help of man;"2436 and that, "Neither is he that planteth
anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase;"2437 and that He in
whom men believe justifieth the ungodly, that his faith may be counted to him for righteousness.
2438 But in behalf of the unity of the Church itself, which is spread abroad throughout
all the world, with which you do not hold communion, I urged that the following passages
were prophesied of Christ: that "He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
river unto the ends of the earth;"2439 and, "I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession;"2440 and that the covenant of God
made with Abraham may be quoted in behalf of our, that is, of the Catholic communion,
in which it is written, "In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed;"2441 which seed
the apostle interprets, saying, "And to thy seed, which is Christ."2442 Whence it is evident
that in Christ not only Africans or Africa, but all the nations through which the Catholic
Church is spread abroad, should receive the blessing which was promised so long before.
And that the chaff is to be with the wheat even to the time of the last winnowing, that no
one may excuse the sacrilege of his own separation from the Church by calumnious accusations
of other men’s offenses, if he shall have left or deserted the communion of all nations;
and to show that the society of Christians may not be divided on account of evil ministers,
that is, evil rulers in the Church, I further quoted the passage, "All whatsoever they bid you
observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works; for they say and do not."2443
With regard to these passages of holy Scripture which I advanced to prove my points, he
neither showed how they ought to be otherwise interpreted, so as to prove that they neither

made for us nor against you, nor was he willing to touch them in any way. Nay, his whole
object was could it have been achieved, that by the tumultuous outpouring of his abuse, it
might never occur to any one at all, who after reading my epistle might have been willing
to read his as well, that these things had been said by me.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">

<head>Chapter 51</head>
<p>63. Next, listen for a short time to the kind of way in which he has tried
to use, in his own behalf, the passages which I had advanced from the writings of the Apostle
Paul. "For you asserted," he says, "that the Apostle Paul finds fault with those who used to
say that they were of the Apostle Paul, saying, ‘Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized
in the name of Paul?’2444 Wherefore, if they were in error, and would have perished had
they not been corrected, because they wished to be of Paul, what hope can there possibly be
for those who have wished to be of Donatus? For this is their sole object, that the origin,
and root, and head of him that is baptized should be none other than he by whom he is
baptized."2445 These words, and this confirmation from the writings of the apostle, he has
quoted from my epistle, and he has proposed to himself the task of refuting them. Go on
then, I beg of you, to see how he has fulfilled the task. For he says, "This assertion is meaningless,
and inflated, and childish, and foolish, and something very far from a true exposition
of our faith. For you would only be right in asserting this, if we were to say, We have been
baptized in the name of Donatus, or Donatus was crucified for us, or we have been baptized
in our own name. But since such things as this neither have been said nor are said by
us,—seeing that we follow the formula of the holy Trinity,—it is clear that you are mad to
bring such accusations against us. Or if you think that we have been baptized in the name
of Donatus, or in our own name, you are miserably deceived, and at the same time confess
in your sacrilege that you on your part defile your wretched selves in the name of Cæcilianus."
This is the answer which Petilianus has made to those arguments of mine, not supposing—or
rather making a noise that no one might suppose—that he has made no answer at all which
could bear in any way upon the question which is under discussion. For who could fail to
see that this witness of the apostle has been adduced by us with all the more propriety, in
that you do not say that you were baptized in the name of Donatus, or that Donatus was
crucified for you, and yet separate yourselves from the communion of the Catholic Church
out of respect to the party of Donatus; as also those whom Paul was rebuking certainly did
not say that they had been baptized in the name of Paul, or that Paul has been crucified for
them, and yet they were making a schism in the name of Paul. As therefore in their case,
for whom Christ, not Paul, was crucified, and who were baptized in the name of Christ, not
of Paul, and who yet said, "I am of Paul," the rebuke is used with all the more propriety,
"Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?" to make them cling
to Him who was crucified for them, and in whose name they were baptized, and not be
guilty of division in the name of Paul; so in your case, also, the rebuke, Was Donatus crucified
for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Donatus? is used all the more appositely, because
you do not say, We were baptized in the name of Donatus, and yet desire to be of the party

<note type="footnote">2445 See Book I. cc. 3, 4, 4, 5.</note>

<pb n="1248"/>
of Donatus. For you know that it was Christ who was crucified for you, and Christ in whose
name you were baptized; and yet, out of respect to the name and party of Donatus, you
show such obstinacy in fighting against the unity of Christ, who was crucified for you, and
in whose name you were baptized.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="52">

<p>64. But if you wish to see that the object of Petilianus in his writings really
was to prove "that the origin, and root, and head of him that is baptized is none other than
he by whom he is baptized," and that this has not been asserted by me without meaning, or
childishly, or foolishly, review the beginning of the epistle itself to which I made my reply,
or rather pay careful attention to me as I quote it. "The conscience," he says, "of one that
gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient; for he who
has received his faith from one that is faithless, receives not faith but guilt." And as though
some one had said to him, Whence do you derive your proof of this? he goes on to say, "For
everything has its existence from a source and root; and if anything has not a head, it is
nothing; nor does anything well confer a new birth, unless it be born again of good seed.
And this being so, brethren, what perversity must it be to maintain that he who is guilty by
reason of his own offenses should make another free from guilt; whereas our Lord Jesus
Christ says, ‘A good tree bringeth forth good fruit: do men gather grapes of thorns?’ And
again, ‘A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things; and
an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things.’ And again, ‘When a man
is baptized by one that is dead, his washing profiteth him nothing.’" You see to what end
all these things tend, viz., that the conscience of him that gives in holiness (lest any one, by
receiving his faith from one that is faithless, should receive not faith but guilt) should be itself
the origin, and root, and head, and seed of him that is baptized. For, wishing to prove that
the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of
the recipient, and that he receives not faith but guilt, who wittingly receives his faith from
one that is faithless, he has added immediately afterwards, "For everything has its existence
from a source and root; and if anything has not a head, it is nothing; nor does anything well
confer a new birth, unless it be born again of good seed." And for fear that any one should
be so dull as still not to understand that in each case he is speaking of the man by whom a
person is baptized, he explains this afterwards, and says, "This being so, brethren, what
perversity must it be to maintain that he who is guilty by reason of his own offenses should
make another free from guilt; whereas our Lord Jesus Christ says, ‘A good tree bringeth
forth good fruit: do men gather grapes of thorns?’" And lest, by some incredible stupidity
of understanding, the hearer or seer should be blind enough not to see that he is speaking
of the man that baptizes, he adds another passage, where he actually specifies the man. "And
again," he says, "‘A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good
things; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things;’ and again, ‘When
a man is baptized by one that is dead, his washing profiteth him nothing,’" Certainly it is
now plain, certainly he needs no longer any interpreter, or disputant, or demonstrator, to
show that the object of his party is to prove that the origin, and root, and head of him that
is baptized is none other than he by whom he is baptized. And yet, being overwhelmed by
the force of truth, and as though forgetful of what he had said before, Petilianus acknowledges

<pb n="1250"/>
afterwards to me that Christ is the origin and root of them that are regenerate, and the Head
of the Church, and not any one that may happen to be the dispenser and minister of baptism.
For having said that the apostles used to baptize in the name of Christ, and set forth Christ
as the foundation of their faith, to make men Christians, and being fain to prove this, too,
by passages and examples from holy Scripture, just as though we were denying it, he says,
"Where is now that voice, from which issued the noise of those minute and constant petty
questionings, wherein, in the spirit of envy and self-conceit, you uttered many involved
sayings about Christ, and for Christ, and in Christ, in opposition to the rashness and
haughtiness of men? Lo, Christ is the origin, Christ is the head, Christ is the root of the
Christian." When, therefore, I heard this, what could I do but give thanks to Christ, who
had compelled the man to make confession? All those things, therefore, are false which he
said in the beginning of his epistle, when he wished to persuade us that the conscience of
one that gives in holiness must be looked for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient; and
that when one has wittingly received his faith from one that is faithless he receives not faith
but guilt. For, wishing as it were to show clearly how much rested in the man that baptizes,
he had added what he seems to think most weighty proofs, saying "For everything has its
existence from a source and root; and if anything has not a head, it is nothing." But afterwards,
when he says what we also say, "Lo, Christ is the origin, Christ is the head, Christ is
the root of the Christian," he wipes out what he had said before, "that the conscience of one
that gives in holiness is the origin, and root, and head of the recipient." The truth, therefore,
has prevailed, so that the man who is desirous to receive the baptism of Christ should not
rest his hope upon the man who administers the sacrament, but should approach in all security
to Christ Himself, as to the source which is not changed, to the root which is not
plucked up, to the head which is not cast down.</p>

<pb n="1251"/>
<head>Chapter 53</head>
<p>65. Then who is there that could fail to perceive from what a vein of
conceit it proceeds, that in explaining as it were the declaration of the apostle, he says, "He
who said, ‘I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase,’ surely meant nothing else
than this, that ‘I made a man a catechumen in Christ, Apollo baptized him; God confirmed
what we had done?’" Why then did not Petilianus add what the apostle added, and I especially
took pains to quote, "So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth;
but God that giveth the increase"?2446 And if he be willing to interpret this on the same
principle as what he has set down above, it follows beyond all doubt, that neither is he that
baptizeth anything but God that giveth the increase. For what matter does it make in reference
to the question now before us, in what sense it has been said, "I planted, Apollos
watered,"—whether it is really to be taken as equivalent to his saying, "I made a catechumen,
Apollos baptized him;" or whether there be any other truer and more congruous understanding
of it?—for in the mean time, according to his own interpretation of the words, neither
is he that makes the catechumen anything, neither he that baptizes, but God that gives the
increase. But there is a great difference between confirming what another does, and doing
anything oneself. For He who gives the increase does not confirm a tree or a vine, but creates
it. For by that increase it comes to pass that even a piece of wood planted in the ground
produces and establishes a root; by that increase it comes to pass that a seed cast into the
earth puts forth a shoot. But why should we make a longer dissertation on this point? It is
enough that, according to Petilianus himself neither he that maketh a catechumen, nor he
that baptizes, is anything, but God that gives the increase. But when would Petilianus say
this, so that we should understand that he meant, Neither is Donatus of Carthage anything,
neither Januarius, neither Petilianus? When would the swelling of his pride permit him to
say this, which now causes the man to think himself to be something, when he is nothing,
deceiving himself?2447</p>

<head>Chapter 54</head>
<p>66. Finally, again, a little afterwards, when he resolved and was firmly
purposed, as it were, to reconsider once more the words of the apostle which he had brought
up against him, he was unwilling to set down this that I had said, preferring something else
in which by some means or other the swelling of human pride might find means to breathe.
"For to reconsider," he says, "those words of the apostle, on which you founded an argument
against us; he said, ‘What is Apollos, what is Paul, save only ministers of Him in whom ye
have believed?’2448 What else for example, does he say to all of us than this, What is Donatus
of Carthage, what is Januarius, what is Petilianus, save only ministers of Him in whom ye
have believed?" I did not bring forward this passage of the apostle, but I did bring forward
that which he has been unwilling to quote, "Neither he that planteth is anything, neither he
that watereth; but God that giveth the increase." But Petilianus was willing to insert those
words of the apostle, in which he asks what is Paul, and what is Apollos, and answers that
"They are ministers of Him in whom ye have believed." This the muscles of the heretic’s
neck could bear; but he was wholly unable to endure the other, in which the apostle did not
ask and answer what he was, but said that he was nothing. But now I am willing to ask
whether it be true that the minister of Christ is nothing. Who will say so much as this? In
what sense, therefore, is it true that "Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that
watereth, but God that giveth the increase," except that he who is something in one point
of view may be nothing in another? For ministering and dispensing the word and sacrament
he is something, but for purifying and justifying he is nothing, seeing that this is not accomplished
in the inner man, except by Him by whom the whole man was created, and who
while He remained God was made man,—by Him, that is, of whom it was said, "Purifying
their hearts by faith;" 2449 and "To him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly."2450
And this testimony Petilianus has been willing to set forth in my words, whilst in his own
he has neither handled it nor even touched it.</p>
<note type="footnote">2448 Ministri ejus cui credidistis. See 1 Cor. iii. 4, 5.</note>

<head>Chapter 55</head>
<p>67. A minister, therefore, that is a dispenser of the word and sacrament
of the gospel, if he is a good man, becomes a fellow-partner in the working of the gospel;
but if he is a bad man, he does not therefore cease to be a dispenser of the gospel. For if he
is good, he does it of his own free will; but if he is a bad man,—that is, one who seeks his
own and not the things of Jesus Christ,—he does it unwillingly, for the sake of other things
which he is seeking after. See, however, what the same apostle has said: "For if I do this
thing willingly," he says, "I have a reward; but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel
is committed unto me;"2451 as though he were to say, If I, being good, announce what is
good, I attain unto it also myself; but if, being evil, I announce it, yet I announce what is
good. For has he in any way said, If I do it against my will, then shall I not be a dispenser
of the gospel? Peter and the other disciples announce the good tidings, as being good
themselves. Judas did it against his will, but yet, when he was sent, he announced it in
common with the rest. They have a reward; to him a dispensation of the gospel was committed.
But they who received the gospel at the mouth of all those witnesses, could not be
cleansed and justified by him that planted, or by him that watered, but by Him alone that
gives the increase. For neither are we going to say that Judas did not baptize, seeing that he
was still among the disciples when that which is written was being accomplished, "Jesus
Himself baptized not, but His disciples."2452 Are we to suppose that, because he had not
betrayed Christ, therefore he who had the bag, and bare what was put therein,2453 was still
enabled to dispense grace without prejudice to those who received it, though he could not
be an upright guardian of the money entrusted to his care? Or if he did not baptize, at any
rate we must acknowledge that he preached the gospel. But if you consider this a trifling
function, and of no importance, see what you must think of the Apostle Paul himself, who
said, "For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel."2454 To this we may add,
that according to this, Apollos begins to be more important, who watered by baptizing, than
Paul, who planted by preaching the gospel, though Paul claims to himself the relation of
father towards the Corinthians in virtue of this very act, and does not grant this title to those
who came to them after him. For he says, "Though ye have ten thousand instructors in
Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the

place, "I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius, and I baptized also
the household of Stephanus."2456 He had begotten them, therefore, not through himself,

but through the gospel. And even though he had been seeking his own, and not the things
of Jesus Christ, and had been doing this unwillingly, so as to receive no reward for himself,
yet he would have been dispensing the treasure of the Lord; and this, though evil himself,
he would not have been making evil or useless to those who received it well.</p>

<p>68. And if this is rightly said of the gospel, with how much greater certainty
should it be said of baptism, which belongs to the gospel in such wise, that without it no
one can reach the kingdom of heaven, and with it only if to the sacrament be added righteousness?
For He who said, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God,"2457 said Himself also, "Except your righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
heaven."2458 The form of the sacrament is given through baptism, the form of righteousness
through the gospel. Neither one without the other leads to the kingdom of heaven. Yet
even men of inferior learning can baptize perfectly, but to preach the gospel perfectly is a
task of much greater difficulty and rarity. Therefore the teacher of the Gentiles, that was
superior in excellence to the majority, was sent to preach the gospel, not to baptize; because
the latter could be done by many, the former only by a few, of whom he was chief. And yet
we read that he said in certain places, "My gospel;"2459 but he never called baptism either
his, or any one’s else by whom it was administered. For that baptism alone which John gave
is called John’s baptism.2460 This that man received as the special pledge of his ministry,
that the preparatory sacrament of washing should even be called by the name of him by
whom it was administered; whereas the baptism which the disciples of Christ administered
was never called by the name of any one of them, that it should be understood to be His
alone of whom it is said, "Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might
sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word."2461 If, therefore, the gospel,
which is Christ’s, but so that a minister also may call it his in virtue of his office of administering
it, can be received by a man even at the hands of an evil minister without danger to
himself, if he does according to what he says, and not after the example of what he does,
how much more may any one who comes in good faith to Christ receive without fear of
contagion from an evil minister the baptism of Christ, which none of the apostles so administered
as to dare to call it his own?</p>

<p>69. Furthermore, if, while I have continued without intermission to prove
how entirely the passages of Scripture which Petilianus has quoted against us have failed to
hurt our cause, he himself has in some cases not touched at all what I have quoted, and
partly, when he has endeavored to handle them, has shown that the only thing that he could
do was to fail in finding an escape from them, you require no long exhortation or advice in
order to see what you ought to maintain, and what you should avoid. But it may be that
this has been the kind of show that he has made in dealing with the testimony of holy
Scripture, but that he has not been without force in the case of the documentary evidence
found in the records of the schism itself. Let us then see in the case of these too, though it
is superfluous to inquire into them after testimony from the word of God, what he has
quoted, or what he has proved. For, after pouring forth a violent invective against traditors,
and quoting loudly many passages against them from the holy books themselves, he yet said
nothing which could prove his opponents to be traditors. But I quoted the case of Silvanus
of Cirta, who held his own see some little time before himself, who was expressly declared
in the Municipal Chronicles to have been a traditor while he was yet a sub-deacon. Against
this fact he did not venture to whisper a syllable. And yet you cannot fail to see how strong
the pressure was which must have been urging him to reply that he might show a man, who
was his predecessor, not only one of his party, but a partner, so to speak, in his see, to have
been innocent of the crime of delivering up the sacred books, especially as you rest the whole
strength of your cause on the fact that you give the name of traditor to all whom you either
pretend or believe to have been the successors of traditors in the path of their communion.
Although, then, the very exigencies of your cause would seem to compel him to undertake
the defence of a citizen even of Russicadia, or Calama, or any other city of your party, whom
I should declare to be a traditor, on the authority of the Municipal Chronicles, yet he did
not open his mouth even in defense of his own predecessor. For what reason, except that
he could not find any mist dark enough to deceive the minds of even the slowest and
sleepiest of men? For what could he have said, except that the charges brought against Silvanus
were false? But we quote the words of the Chronicles, both as to the date of the fact,
and as to the time of the information laid before Zenophilus the ex-consul.2462 And how
could he resist this evidence, being encompassed on every side by the most excellent cause
of the Catholics, while yours was bad as bad could be? For which reason I quote these words
from my epistle to which he would fain be thought to have replied in this which I am now
refuting, that you may see for yourselves how impregnable the position must be against
which he has been able to find no safer weapon than silence.</p>

<head>Chapter 58</head>
<p>70. For when he quoted a passage from the gospel as making against us,
where our Lord says, "They will come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are
ravening wolves; ye shall know them by their fruits,"2463—I answered and said, "Then let
us consider their fruits;" and then I at once went on to add the following words: "You bring
up against them their delivery of the sacred books. This very charge we urge with greater
probability, against their accusers themselves. And not to carry our search too far: in the
same city of Constantina, your predecessors ordained Silvanus bishop at the very outset of
his schism. He, while he was still a sub-deacon, was most unmistakably entered as a traditor
in the archives of the city. If you, on your side, bring forward documents against our predecessors,
all that we ask is equal terms, that we should either believe both to be true, or both
to be false. If both are true, you are unquestionably guilty of schism, who have pretended
that you avoid offenses in the communion of the whole world, though these were common
among you in your own fragmentary sect. But again, if both are false, you are unquestionably
guilty of schism, who, on account of the false charges of traditors, are staining yourselves
with the heinous offense of severance from the Church. But if we have something to urge
in accusation, while you have nothing, or if our charges are true, while yours are false, it is
no longer matter of discussion how thoroughly your mouths are closed. What if the holy
and true Church of Christ were to convince and overcome you, even if we held no documents
in support of our cause, or only such as were false, while you had possession of some genuine
proof of delivery of the sacred books, what would then remain for you, except that, if you
would, you should show your love of peace, or otherwise should hold your tongues? For
whatever in that case you might bring forward in evidence, I should be able to say with the
greatest ease and with the most perfect truth, that then you are bound to prove as much to
the full and Catholic unity of the Church, already spread abroad and established throughout
so many nations, to the end that you should remain within, and that those whom you convict
should be expelled. And if you have endeavored to do this, certainly you have not been able
to make good your proof; and, being vanquished or enraged, you have separated yourselves,
with all the heinous guilt of sacrilege, from the guiltless men who could not condemn on
insufficient proof. But if you have not even endeavored to do this, then with most accursed
and unnatural blindness you have cut yourselves off from the wheat of Christ, which grows
throughout His whole fields, that is, throughout the whole world until the end, because you
have taken offense at a few tares in Africa."2464 To this, which I have quoted from my former
epistle, Petilianus has made no answer whatsoever. And, at all events, you see that in these
few words is comprised the whole question which is at issue between us. For what should
he endeavor to say, when, whatever course he chose, he was sure to be debated?</p>

<note type="footnote">2464 See Book I. cc. 21, 22, 23, 24.</note>

<pb n="1258"/>
<p>71. For when documents are brought forward relating to the traditors, both by us against
the men of your party, and by you against the men of our party, (if indeed any really are
brought forward on your side, for to this very day we are left in total ignorance of them; nor
indeed can we believe that Petilianus would have omitted to insert them in his letter, seeing
that he has taken so much pain to secure the quotation and insertion of those portions of
the Chronicles which bear on the matter in opposition to me),—but still, as I began to say,
if such documents are brought forward both by us and by you, documents of whose existence
we are wholly ignorant to this very day,—surely you must acknowledge that either both are
true, or both false, or ours true and yours false, or yours true and ours false; for there is no
further alternative that can be suggested.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="59">
<pb n="1259"/>
<head>Chapter 59</head>
<p>But according to all these four hypotheses, the truth is on the side of the
communion of the Catholic Church. For if both are true, then you certainly should not
have deserted the communion of the whole world on account of men such as you too had
among yourselves. But if both are false, you should have guarded against the guilt of most
accursed division, which had not even any pretext to allege of any delivery of the sacred
books. If ours are true and yours are false, you have long been without anything to say for
yourselves. If yours are true and ours are false, we have been liable to be deceived, in common
with the whole world, not about the truth of the faith, but about the unrighteousness of
men. For the seed of Abraham, dispersed throughout the world, was bound to pay attention,
not to what you said you knew, but to what you proved to the judges. Whence have we any
knowledge of what was done by those men who were accused by your ancestors, even if the
allegations made against them were true, so long as they were held to be not true but false,
either by the judges who took cognizance of the case, or at least by the general body of the
Church dispersed throughout the world, which was only bound to pay heed to the sentence
of the judges? God does not necessarily pardon any human guilt that others in the weakness
of human judgment fail to discover; yet I maintain that no one is rightly deemed guilty for
having believed a man to be innocent who was not convicted. How then do you prove the
world to be guilty, merely because it did not know what possibly was really guilt in the
Africans,—its ignorance arising either from the fact that no one reported the sin to it, or
from its having given credence, in respect of the information which was given, rather to the
judges who took cognizance of the case, than to the murmurers who were defeated? So far
then, Petilianus deserves all praise, in that, when he saw that on this point I was absolutely
impregnable, he passed it by in silence. Yet he does not deserve praise for his attempts to
obscure in a mist of words other points which were equally impregnable, which yet he
thought could be obscured; or for having put me in the place of his cause, when the cause
left him nothing to say; while even about myself he could say nothing except what was either
altogether false, or undeserving of any blame, or without any bearing whatsoever upon me.
But, in the meantime, are you, whom I have made judges between Petilianus and myself,
possessed of discrimination enough to decide in any degree between what is true and what
is false, between what is mere empty swelling and what is solid, between what is troubled
and what is calm, between inflammation and soundness, between divine predictions and
human assumptions, between bringing an accusation and establishing it, between proofs
and fictions, between pleading a cause and leading one away from it? If you have such power
of discrimination, well and good; but if you have it not, we shall not repent of having bestowed
our pains on you, for even though your heart be not converted unto peace, yet our
peace shall return unto ourselves.</p>

<head>A TREATISE
CONCERNING
THE CORRECTION OF THE DONATISTS;
Or Epistle CLXXXV.2465</head>
<p>A Letter of Augustin2466 to Boniface, who, as we learn from Epistle 220, was Tribune, and
afterwards Count in Africa. In it Augustin shows that the heresy of the Donatists has
nothing in common with that of Arius; and points out the moderation with which it was
possible to recall the heretics to the communion of the Church through awe of the imperial
laws. He adds remarks concerning the savage conduct of the Donatists and Circumcelliones,
concluding with a discussion of the unpardonable nature of the sin against the
Holy Ghost.2467</p>
<note type="footnote">2465 Written c. 417.</note>
<note type="footnote">2466 In Book 11. c. xlviii of his Retractations, Augustin says: "About the same time" (as that at which he
wrote his treatise De Gestis Pelagii, i.e., about the year 417), "I wrote also a treatise De Correctione Donatistarum,
for the sake of those who were not willing that the Donatists should be subjected to the correction of the imperial
laws." This treatise begins with the words "Laudo, et gratulor, et admiror." This letter in the old editions was
No. 50,—the letter which is now No. 4 in the appendix (Benedictine) being formerly No. 185.</note>

<head>Chapter 1</head>
<p>1. I must express my satisfaction, and congratulations, and admiration,
my son Boniface,2468 in that, amid all the cares of wars and arms, you are eagerly anxious
to know concerning the things that are of God. From hence it is clear that in you it is actually
a part of your military valor to serve in truth the faith which is in Christ. To place, therefore,
briefly before your Grace the difference between the errors of the Arians and the Donatists,
the Arians say that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are different in substance;
whereas the Donatists do not say this, but acknowledge the unity of substance in the Trinity.
And if some even of them have said that the Son was inferior to the Father, yet they have
not denied that He is of the same substance; whilst the greater part of them declare that they
hold entirely the same belief regarding the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost as is held
by the Catholic Church. Nor is this the actual question in dispute with them; but they carry
on their unhappy strife solely on the question of communion, and in the perversity of their
error maintain rebellious hostility against the unity of Christ. But sometimes, as we have
heard, some of them, wishing to conciliate the Goths, since they see that they are not without
a certain amount of power, profess to entertain the same belief as they. But they are refuted
by the authority of their own leaders; for Donatus himself, of whose party they boast
themselves to be, is never said to have held this belief.</p>
<p>2. Let not, however, things like these disturb thee, my beloved son. For it is foretold to
us that there must needs be heresies and stumbling-blocks, that we may be instructed among
our enemies; and that so both our faith and our love may be the more approved,—our faith,
namely, that we should not be deceived by them; and our love, that we should take the utmost
pains we can to correct the erring ones themselves; not only watching that they should do
no injury to the weak, and that they should be delivered from their wicked error, but also
praying for them, that God would open their understanding, and that they might comprehend
the Scriptures. For in the sacred books, where the Lord Christ is made manifest, there is
also His Church declared; but they, with wondrous blindness, while they would know
nothing of Christ Himself save what is revealed in the Scriptures, yet form their notion of
His Church from the vanity of human falsehood, instead of learning what it is on the authority
of the sacred books.</p>
<p>3. They recognize Christ together with us in that which is written, "They pierced my
hands and my feet. They can tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They part my
garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture;" and yet they refuse to recognize the
Church in that which follows shortly after: "All the ends of the world shall remember, and
turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee. For the
<note type="footnote">2468 The correspondence between Augustin and Boniface is limited to Epp. 185, 189 and 220. The sixteen
smaller letters are spurious. For note to Boniface and translations of 189 and 220, see vol. I of this series pp. 552
and 573.</note>

kingdom is the Lord’s; and He is the Governor among the nations."2469 They recognize
Christ together with us in that which is written, "The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my
Son, this day have I begotten Thee;" and they will not recognize the Church in that which
follows: "Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost
parts of the earth for Thy possession."2470 They recognize Christ together with us in
that which the Lord Himself says in the gospel, "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise
from the dead the third day;" and they will not recognize the Church in that which follows:
"And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations,
beginning at Jerusalem."2471 And the testimonies in the sacred books are without
number, all of which it has not been necessary for me to crowd together into this book.
And in all of them, as the Lord Christ is made manifest, whether in accordance with His
Godhead, in which He is equal to the Father, so that, "In the beginning was the Word, and;
the Word was with God, and the Word was God;" or according to the humility of the flesh
which He took upon Him, whereby "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us;"2472 so
is His Church made manifest, not in Africa alone, as they most impudently venture in the
madness of their vanity to assert, but spread abroad throughout the world.</p>
<p>4. For they prefer to the testimonies of Holy Writ their own contentions, because, in
the case of Cæcilianus, formerly a bishop of the Church of Carthage, against whom they
brought charges which they were and are unable to substantiate, they separated themselves
from the Catholic Church,—that is, from the unity of all nations. Although, even if the
charges had been true which were brought by them against Cæcilianus, and could at length
be proved to us, yet, though we might pronounce an anathema upon him even in the
grave,2473 we are still bound not for the sake of any man to leave the Church, which rests
for its foundation on divine witness, and is not the figment of litigious opinions, seeing that
it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.2474 For we cannot allow that
if Cæcilianus had erred,—a supposition which I make without prejudice to his integrity,—
Christ should therefore have forfeited His inheritance. It is easy for a man to believe
of his fellow-men either what is true or what is false; but it marks abandoned impudence to
desire to condemn the communion of the whole world on account of charges alleged against
a man, of which you cannot establish the truth in the face of the world.</p>

<p>5. Whether Cæcilianus was ordained by men who had delivered up the sacred books,
I do not know. I did not see it, I heard it only from his enemies. It is not declared to me in
the law of God, or in the utterances of the prophets, or in the holy poetry of the Psalms, or
in the writings of any one of Christ’s apostles, or in the eloquence of Christ Himself. But
the evidence of all the several scriptures with one accord proclaims the Church spread abroad
throughout the world, with which the faction of Donatus does not hold communion. The
law of God declared, "In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."2475 The Lord
said by the mouth of His prophet, "From the rising of the sun, even unto the going down
of the same, a pure sacrifice shall be offered unto my name: for my name shall be great
among the heathen."2476 The Lord said through the Psalmist, "He shall have dominion also
from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth."2477 The Lord said by His
apostle, "The gospel is come unto you, as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit."2478
The Son of God said with His own mouth, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem,
and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even unto the uttermost part of the earth."2479 Cæcilianus,
the bishop of the Church of Carthage, is accused with the contentiousness of men;
the Church of Christ, established among all nations, is recommended by the voice of God.
Mere piety, truth, and love forbid us to receive against Cæcilianus the testimony of men
whom we do not find in the Church, which has the testimony of God; for those who do not
follow the testimony of God have forfeited the weight which otherwise would attach to their
testimony as men.</p>

<p>6. I would add, moreover, that they themselves, by making it the subject
of an accusation, referred the case of Cæcilianus to the decision of the Emperor Constantine;
and that, even after the bishops had pronounced their judgment,2480 finding that they could
not crush Cæcilianus, they brought him in person before the above-named emperor for
trial, in the most determined spirit of persecution. And so they were themselves the first to
do what they censure in us, in order that they may deceive the unlearned, saying that
Christians ought not to demand any assistance from Christian emperors against the enemies
of Christ. And this, too, they did not dare to deny in the conference which we held at the
same time in Carthage: nay, they even venture to make it a matter of boasting that their
fathers had laid a criminal indictment against Cæcilianus before the emperor; adding furthermore
a lie, to the effect that they had there worsted him, and procured his condemnation.
How then can they be otherwise than persecutors, seeing that when they persecuted Cæcilianus
by their accusations, and were overcome by him, they sought to claim false glory for
themselves by a most shameless life; not only considering it no reproach, but glorying in it
as conducive to their praise, if they could prove that Cæcilianus had been condemned on
the accusation of their fathers? But in regard to the manner in which they were overcome
at every turn in the conference itself, seeing that the records are exceedingly voluminous,
and it would be a serious matter to have them read to you while you are occupied in other
matters that are essential to the peace of Rome, perhaps it may be possible to have a digest
2481 of them read to you, which I believe to be in the possession of my brother and fellowbishop
Optatus; or if he has not a copy, he might easily procure one from the church at Sitifa;
for I can well believe that even that volume will prove wearisome enough to you from its
lengthiness, amid the burden of your many cares.</p>
<p>7. For the Donatists met with the same fate as the accusers of the holy Daniel.2482 For
as the lions were turned against them, so the laws by which they had proposed to crush an
innocent victim were turned against the Donatists; save that, through the mercy of Christ,
the laws which seemed to be opposed to them are in reality their truest friends; for through
their operation many of them have been, and are daily being reformed, and return God
thanks that they are reformed, and delivered from their ruinous madness. And those who
used to hate are now filled with love; and now that they have recovered their right minds,
they congratulate themselves that these most wholesome laws were brought to bear against
them, with as much fervency as in their madness they detested them; and are filled with the
same spirit of ardent love towards those who yet remain as ourselves, desiring that we should

strive in like manner that those with whom they had been like to perish might be saved.
For both the physician is irksome to the raging madman, and a father to his undisciplined
son,—the former because of the restraint, the latter because of the chastisement which he
inflicts; yet both are acting in love. But if they were to neglect their charge, and allow them
to perish, this mistaken kindness would more truly be accounted cruelty. For if the horse
and mule, which have no understanding, resist with all the force of bites and kicks the efforts
of the men who treat their wounds in order to cure them; and yet the men, though they are
often exposed to danger from their teeth and heels, and sometimes meet with actual hurt,
nevertheless do not desert them till they restore them to health through the pain and annoyance
which the healing process gives,—how much more should man refuse to desert his
fellow-man, or brother to desert his brother, lest he should perish everlastingly, being himself
now able to comprehend the vastness of the boon accorded to himself in his reformation,
at the very time that he complained of suffering persecution?</p>
<p>8. As then the apostle says, "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
men, not being weary in well-doing,"2483 so let all be called to salvation, let all be recalled
from the path of destruction,—those who may, by the sermons of Catholic preachers; those
who may, by the edicts of Catholic princes; some through those who obey the warnings of
God, some through those who obey the emperor’s commands. For, moreover, when emperors
enact bad laws on the side of falsehood, as against the truth, those who hold a right faith
are approved, and, if they persevere, are crowned; but when the emperors enact good laws
on behalf of the truth against falsehood, then those who rage against them are put in fear,
and those who understand are reformed. Whosoever, therefore, refuses to obey the laws of
the emperors which are enacted against the truth of God, wins for himself a great reward;
but whosoever refuses to obey the laws of the emperors which are enacted in behalf of truth,
wins for himself great condemnation. For in the times, too, of the prophets, the kings who,
in dealing with the people of God, did not prohibit nor annul the ordinances which were
issued contrary to God’s commands, are all of them censured; and those who did prohibit
and annul them are praised as deserving more than other men. And king Nebuchadnezzar,
when he was a servant of idols, enacted an impious law that a certain idol should be worshipped;
but those who refused to obey his impious command acted piously and faithfully.
And the very same king, when converted by a miracle from God, enacted a pious and
praiseworthy law on behalf of the truth, that every one who should speak anything amiss
against the true God, the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, should perish utterly,
with all his house.2484 If any persons disobeyed this law, and justly suffered the penalty
imposed, they might have said what these men say, that they were righteous because they
<note type="footnote">2483 Gal. vi. 9, 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">2484 Dan. iii. 5, 29.</note>

<pb n="1267"/>
suffered persecution through the law enacted by the king: and this they certainly would
have said, had they been as mad as these who make divisions between the members of Christ,
and spurn the sacraments of Christ, and take credit for being persecuted, because they are
prevented from doing such things by the laws which the emperors have passed to preserve
the unity of Christ and boast falsely of their innocence, and seek from men the glory of
martyrdom, which they cannot receive from our Lord.</p>
<p>9. But true martyrs are such as those of whom the Lord says, "Blessed are they which
are persecuted for righteousness’ sake."2485 It is not, therefore, those who suffer persecution
for their unrighteousness, and for the divisions which they impiously introduce into
Christian unity, but those who suffer for righteousness’ sake, that are truly martyrs. For
Hagar also suffered persecution at the hands of Sarah;2486 and in that case she who persecuted
was righteous, and she unrighteous who suffered persecution. Are we to compare with this
persecution which Hagar suffered the case of holy David, who was persecuted by unrighteous
Saul?2487 Surely there is in essential difference, not in respect of his suffering, but because
he suffered for righteousness’ sake. And the Lord Himself was crucified with two thieves;2488
but those who were joined in their suffering were separated by the difference of its cause.
Accordingly, in the psalm, we must interpret of the true martyrs, who wish to be distinguished
from false martyrs, the verse in which it is said, "Judge me, O Lord, and distinguish2489 my
cause from an ungodly nation."2490 He does not say, Distinguish my punishment, but
"Distinguish my cause." For the punishment of the impious may be the same; but the cause
of the martyrs is always different. To whose mouth also the words are suitable, "They persecute
me wrongfully; help Thou me;"2491 in which the Psalmist claimed to have a right to
be helped in righteousness, because his adversaries persecuted him wrongfully; for if they
had been right in persecuting him, he would have deserved not help, but correction.</p>
<p>10. But if they think that no one can be justified in using violence,—as they said in the
course of the conference that the true Church must necessarily be the one which suffers
persecution, not the one inflicting it,—in that case I no longer urge what I observed above;
because, if the matter stand as they maintain that it does, then Cæcilianus must have belonged
to the true Church, seeing that their fathers persecuted him, by pressing his accusation even
to the tribunal of the emperor himself. For we maintain that he belonged to the true Church,

<pb n="1268"/>
not merely because he suffered persecution, but because he suffered it for righteousness’
sake; but that they were alienated from the Church, not merely because they persecuted,
but because they did so in unrighteousness. This, then, is our position. But if they make
no inquiry into the causes for which each person inflicts persecution, or for which he suffers
it, but think that it is a sufficient sign of a true Christian that he does not inflict persecution,
but suffers it, then beyond all question they include Cæcilianus in that definition, who did
not inflict, but suffered persecution; and they equally exclude their own fathers from the
definition, for they inflicted, but did not suffer it.</p>
<p>11. But this, I say, I forbear to urge. Yet one point I must press: If the true Church is
the one which actually suffers persecution, not the one which inflicts it, let them ask the
apostle of what Church Sarah was a type, when she inflicted persecution on her hand-maid.
For he declares that the free mother of us all, the heavenly Jerusalem, that is to say, the true
Church of God, was prefigured in that woman who cruelly entreated her hand-maid. 2492
But if we investigate the story further, we shall find that the handmaid rather persecuted
Sarah by her haughtiness, than Sarah the handmaid by her severity: for the handmaid was
doing wrong to her mistress; the mistress only imposed on her a proper discipline in her
haughtiness. Again I ask, if good and holy men never inflict persecution upon any one, but
only suffer it, whose words they think that those are in the psalm where we read, "I have
pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn again till they were consumed?"
2493 If, therefore, we wish either to declare or to recognize the truth, there is a
persecution of unrighteousness, which the impious inflict upon the Church of Christ; and
there is a righteous persecution, which the Church of Christ inflicts upon the impious. She
therefore is blessed in suffering persecution for righteousness’ sake; but they are miserable,
suffering persecution for unrighteousness. Moreover, she persecutes in the spirit of love,
they in the spirit of wrath; she that she may correct, they that they may overthrow: she that
she may recall from error, they that they may drive headlong into error. Finally, she persecutes
her enemies and arrests them, until they become weary in their vain opinions, so that
they should make advance in the truth; but they, returning evil for good, because we take
measures for their good, to secure their eternal salvation, endeavor even to strip us of our
temporal safety, being so in love with murder, that they commit it on their own persons,
when they cannot find victims in any others. For in proportion as the Christian charity of
the Church endeavors to deliver them from that destruction, so that none of them should
die, so their madness endeavors either to slay us, that they may feed the lust of their own
cruelty, or even to kill themselves, that they may not seem to have lost the power of putting
men to death.</p>

<p>12. But those who are unacquainted with their habits think that they only
kill themselves now that all the mass of the people are freed from the fearful madness of
their usurped dominion, in virtue of the laws which have been passed for the preservation
of unity. But those who know what they were accustomed to do before the passing of the
laws, do not wonder at their deaths, but call to mind their character; and especially how vast
crowds of them used to come in procession to the most frequented ceremonies of the pagans,
while the worship of idols still continued,—not with the view of breaking the idols, but that
they might be put to death by those who worshipped them. For if they had sought to break
the idols under the sanction of legitimate authority, they might, in case of anything happening
to them, have had some shadow of a claim to be considered martyrs; but their only object
in coming was, that while the idols remained uninjured, they themselves might meet with
death. For it was the general custom of the strongest youths among the worshippers of
idols, for each of them to offer in sacrifice to the idols themselves any victims that he might
have slain. Some went so far as to offer themselves for slaughter to any travellers whom
they met with arms, using violent threats that they would murder them if they failed to meet
with death at their hands. Sometimes, too, they extorted with violence from any passing
judge that they should be put to death by the executioners, or by the officer of his court.
And hence we have a story, that a certain judge played a trick upon them, by ordering them
to be bound and led away, as though for execution, and so escaped their violence, without
injury to himself or them. Again, it was their daily sport to kill themselves, by throwing
themselves over precipices, or into the water, or into the fire. For the devil taught them
these three modes of suicide, so that, when they wished to die, and could not find any one
whom they could terrify into slaying them with his sword, they threw themselves over the
rocks, or committed themselves to the fire or the eddying pool. But who can be thought to
have taught them this, having gained possession of their hearts, but he who actually suggested
to our Saviour Himself as a duty sanctioned by the law, that He should throw Himself down
from a pinnacle of the temple? 2494 And his suggestion they would surely have thrust far
from them, had they carried Christ, as their Master, in their hearts. But since they have
rather given place within them to the devil, they either perish like the herd of swine, whom
the legion of devils drove down from the hill-side into the sea,2495 or, being rescued from
that destruction, and gathered together in the loving bosom of our Catholic Mother, they
are delivered just as the boy was delivered by our Lord, whom his father brought to be healed
of the devil, saying that ofttimes he was wont to fall into the fire, and oft into the water.2496</p>

<pb n="1270"/>
<p>13. Whence it appears that great mercy is shown towards them, when by the force of
those very imperial laws they are in the first instance rescued against their will from that
sect in which, through the teaching of lying devils, they learned those evil doctrines, so that
afterwards they might be made whole in the Catholic Church, becoming accustomed to the
good teaching and example which they find in it. For many of the men whom we now admire
in the unity of Christ, for the pious fervor of their faith, and for their charity, give thanks
to God with great joy that they are no longer in that error which led them to mistake those
evil things for good,—which thanks they would not now be offering willingly, had they not
first, even against their will, been severed from that impious association. And what are we
to say of those who confess to us, as some do every day, that even in the olden days they had
long been wishing to be Catholics; but they were living among men among whom those
who wished to be Catholics could not be so through the infirmity of fear, seeing that if any
one there said a single word in favor of the Catholic Church, he and his house were utterly
destroyed at once? Who is mad enough to deny that it was right that assistance should have
been given through the imperial decrees, that they might be delivered from so great an evil,
whilst those whom they used to fear are compelled in turn to fear, and are either themselves
corrected through the same terror, or, at any rate, whilst they pretend to be corrected, they
abstain from further persecution of those who really are, to whom they formerly were objects
of continual dread?</p>
<p>14. But if they have chosen to destroy themselves, in order to prevent the deliverance
of those who had a right to be delivered, and have sought in this way to alarm the pious
hearts of the deliverers, so that in their apprehension that some few abandoned men might
perish, they should allow others to lose the opportunity of deliverance from destruction,
who were either already unwilling to perish, or might have been saved from it by the employment
of compulsion; what is in this case the function of Christian charity, especially
when we consider that those who utter threats of their own violent and voluntary deaths
are very few in number in comparison with the nations that are to be delivered? What then
is the function of brotherly love? Does it, because it fears the shortlived fires of the furnace
for a few, therefore abandon all to the eternal fires of hell? and does it leave so many, who
are either already desirous, or hereafter are not strong enough to pass to life eternal, to
perish everlastingly, while taking precautions that some few should not perish by their own
hand, who are only living to be a hindrance in the way of the salvation of others, whom they
will not permit to live in accordance with the doctrines of Christ, in the hopes that some
day or other they may teach them too to hasten their death by their own hand, in the manner
which now causes them themselves to be a terror to their neighbors, in accordance with the
custom inculcated by their devilish tenets? or does it rather save all whom it can, even though
those whom it cannot save should perish in their own infatuation? For it ardently desires
that all should live, but it more especially labors that not all should die. But thanks be to

<pb n="1271"/>
the Lord, that both amongst us—not indeed everywhere, but in the great majority of
places—and also in the other parts of Africa, the peace of the Catholic Church both has
gained and is gaining ground, without any of these madmen being killed. But those deplorable
deeds are done in places where there is an utterly furious and useless set of men, who
were given to such deeds even in the days of old.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">

<p>15. And indeed, before those laws were put in force by the emperors of
the Catholic faith, the doctrine of the peace and unity of Christ was beginning by degrees
to gain ground, and men were coming over to it even from the faction of Donatus, in proportion
as each learned more, and became more willing, and more master of his own actions;
although, at the same time, among the Donatists herds of abandoned men were disturbing
the peace of the innocent for one reason or another in the spirit of the most reckless madness.
What master was there who was not compelled to live in dread of his own servant, if he had
put himself under the guardianship of the Donatists? Who dared even threaten one who
sought his ruin with punishment? Who dared to exact payment of a debt from one who
consumed his stores, or from any debtor whatsoever, that sought their assistance or protection?
Under the threat of beating, and burning, and immediate death, all documents compromising
the worst of slaves were destroyed, that they might depart in freedom. Notes of
hand that had been extracted from debtors were returned to them. Any one who had shown
a contempt for their hard words were compelled by harder blows to do what they desired.
The houses of innocent persons who had offended them were either razed to the ground or
burned. Certain heads of families of honorable parentage, and brought up with a good
education were carried away half dead after their deeds of violence, or bound to the mill,
and compelled by blows to turn it round, after the fashion of the meanest beasts of burden.
For what assistance from the laws rendered by the civil powers was ever of any avail against
them? What official ever ventured so much as to breathe in their presence? What agents
ever exacted payment of a debt which they had been unwilling to discharge? Who ever endeavored
to avenge those who were put to death in their massacres? Except, indeed, that
their own madness took revenge on them, when some, by provoking against themselves the
swords of men, whom they obliged to kill them under fear of instant death, others by
throwing themselves over sundry precipices, others by waters, others by fire, gave themselves
over on the several occasions to a voluntary death, and gave up their lives as offerings to the
dead by punishments inflicted with their own hands upon themselves.</p>
<p>16. These deeds were looked upon with horror by many who were firmly rooted in the
same superstitious heresy; and accordingly, when they supposed that it was sufficient to
establish their innocence that they were ill contented with such conduct, it was urged against
them by the Catholics: If these evil deeds do not pollute your innocence, how then do you
maintain that the whole Christian world has been polluted by the alleged sin of Cæcilianus,
which are either altogether calumnies, or at least not proved against him? How come you,
by a deed of gross impiety, to separate yourselves from the unity of the Catholic Church, as
from the threshing-floor of the Lord, which must needs contain, up to the time of the final
winnowing, both corn which is to be stored in the garner, and chaff that is to be burned up
with fire?2497 And thus some were so convinced by argument as to come over to the unity
<note type="footnote">2497 Matt. iii. 12.</note>

<pb n="1273"/>
of the Catholic Church, being prepared even to meet the hostility of abandoned men; whilst
the greater number, though equally convinced, and though desirous to do the same, yet
dared not make enemies of these men, who were so unbridled in their violence, seeing that
some who had come over to us experienced the greatest cruelty at their hands.</p>
<p>17. To this we may add, that in Carthage itself some of the bishops of the same party,
making a schism among themselves, and dividing the party of Donatus among the lower
orders of the Carthaginian people, ordained as bishop against bishop a certain deacon named
Maximianus, who could not brook the control of his own diocesan. And as this displeased
the greater part of them, they condemned the aforesaid Maximinus, with twelve others who
had been present at his ordination, but gave the rest that were associated in the same schism
a chance of returning to their communion on an appointed day. But afterwards some of
these twelve, and certain others of those who had had the time of grace allowed to them,
but had only returned after the day appointed, were received by them without degradation
from their orders; and they did not venture to baptize a second time those whom the condemned
ministers had baptized outside the pale of their communion. This action of theirs
at once made strongly against them in favor of the Catholic party, so that their mouths were
wholly closed. And on the matter being diligently spread abroad, as was only right, in order
to cure men’s souls of the evils of schism, and when it was shown in every possible direction
by the sermons and discussions of the Catholic divines, that to maintain the peace of Donatus
they had not only received back those whom they had condemned, with full recognition of
their orders, but had even been afraid to declare that baptism to be void which had been
administered outside their Church by men whom they had condemned or even suspended;
whilst, in violation of the peace of Christ, they cast in the teeth of all the world the stain
conveyed by contact with some sinners, it matters little with whom, and declared baptism
to be consequently void which had been administered even in the very Churches whence
the gospel itself had come to Africa;—seeing all this, very many began to be confounded,
and blushing before what they saw to be mostly manifest truth, they submitted to correction
in greater numbers than was their wont; and men began to breathe with a somewhat freer
sense of liberty from their cruelty, and that to a considerably greater extent in every direction.</p>
<p>18. Then indeed they blazed forth with such fury, and were so excited by the goadings
of hatred, that scarcely any churches of our communion could be safe against their treachery
and violence and most undisguised robberies; scarcely any road secure by which men could
travel to preach the peace of the Catholic Church in opposition to their madness, and convict
the rashness of their folly by the clear enunciation of the truth. They went so far, besides,
in proposing hard terms of reconciliation, not only to the laity or to any of the clergy, but
even in a measure to certain of the Catholic bishops. For the only alternative offered was
to hold their tongues about the truth, or to endure their savage fury. But if they did not
speak about the truth, not only was it impossible for any one to be delivered by their silence,

<pb n="1274"/>
but many were even sure to be destroyed by their submitting to be led astray; while if, by
their preaching the truth, the rage of the Donatists was again provoked to vent its madness,
though some would be delivered, and those who were already on our side would be
strengthened, yet the weak would again be deterred by fear from following the truth. When
the Church, therefore, was reduced to these straits in its affliction, any one who thinks that
anything was to be endured, rather than that the assistance of God, to be rendered through
the agency of Christian emperors, should be sought, does not sufficiently observe that no
good account could possibly be rendered for neglect of this precaution.</p>

<p>19. But as to the argument of those men who are unwilling that their impious
deeds should be checked by the enactment of righteous laws, when they say that the
apostles never sought such measures from the kings of the earth, they do not consider the
different character of that age, and that everything comes in its own season. For what emperor
had as yet believed in Christ, so as to serve Him in the cause of piety by enacting laws
against impiety, when as yet the declaration of the prophet was only in the course of its fulfillment,
"Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the
earth set themselves, and their rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against
His Anointed;" and there was as yet no sign of that which is spoken a little later in the same
psalm: "Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the
Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling."2498 How then are kings to serve the Lord with
fear, except by preventing and chastising with religious severity all those acts which are done
in opposition to the commandments of the Lord? For a man serves God in one way in that
he is man, in another way in that he is also king. In that he is man, he serves Him by living
faithfully; but in that he is also king, he serves Him by enforcing with suitable rigor such
laws as ordain what is righteous, and punish what is the reverse. Even as Hezekiah served
Him, by destroying the groves and the temples of the idols, and the high places which had
been built in violation of the commandments of God;2499 or even as Josiah served Him, by
doing the same things in his turn;2500 or as the king of the Ninevites served Him, by compelling
all the men of his city to make satisfaction to the Lord;2501 or as Darius served Him,
by giving the idol into the power of Daniel to be broken, and by casting his enemies into
the den of lions;2502 or as Nebuchadnezzar served Him, of whom I have spoken before, by
issuing a terrible law to prevent any of his subjects from blaspheming God.2503 In this way,
therefore, kings can serve the Lord, even in so far as they are kings, when they do in His
service what they could not do were they not kings.</p>
<p>20. Seeing, then, that the kings of the earth were not yet serving the Lord in the time
of the apostles, but were still imagining vain things against the Lord and against His
Anointed, that all might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, it must be granted
that at that time acts of impiety could not possibly be prevented by the laws, but were rather
performed under their sanction. For the order of events was then so rolling on, that even
the Jews were killing those who preached Christ, thinking that they did God service in so

doing, just as Christ had foretold,2504 and the heathen were raging against the Christians,
and the patience of the martyrs was overcoming them all. But so soon as the fulfillment
began of what is written in a later psalm, "All kings shall fall down before Him; all nations
shall serve Him,"2505 what sober-minded man could say to the kings, "Let not any thought
trouble you within your kingdom as to who restrains or attacks the Church of your Lord;
deem it not a matter in which you should be concerned, which of your subjects may choose
to be religious or sacrilegious," seeing that you cannot say to them, "Deem it no concern of
yours which of your subjects may choose to be chaste, or which unchaste?" For why, when
free-will is given by God to man, should adulteries be punished by the laws, and sacrilege
allowed? Is it a lighter matter that a soul should not keep faith with God, than that a woman
should be faithless to her husband? Or if those faults which are committed not in contempt
but in ignorance of religious truth are to be visited with lighter punishment, are they
therefore to be neglected altogether?</p>

<p>21. It is indeed better (as no one ever could deny) that men should be led
to worship God by teaching, than that they should be driven to it by fear of punishment or
pain; but it does not follow that because the former course produces the better men, therefore
those who do not yield to it should be neglected. For many have found advantage (as we
have proved, and are daily proving by actual experiment), in being first compelled by fear
or pain, so that they might afterwards be influenced by teaching, or might follow out in act
what they had already learned in word. Some, indeed, set before us the sentiments of a
certain secular author, who said,
<lg>
<l>"’Tis well, I ween, by shame the young to train,</l>
<l>And dread of meanness, rather than by pain."2506</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>This is unquestionably true. But while those are better who are guided aright by love,
those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by fear. For, to answer these persons
out of their own author, we find him saying in another place,
<lg>
<l>"Unless by pain and suffering thou art taught,</l>
<l>Thou canst not guide thyself aright in aught."2507</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>But, moreover, holy Scripture has both said concerning the former better class, "There
is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear;"2508 and also concerning the latter lower
class, which furnishes the majority, "A servant will not be corrected by words; for though
he understand, he will not answer."2509 In saying, "He will not be corrected by words," he
did not order him to be left to himself, but implied an admonition as to the means whereby
he ought to be corrected; otherwise he would not have said, "He will not be corrected by
words," but without any qualification, "He will not be corrected." For in another place he
says that not only the servant, but also the undisdained son, must be corrected with stripes,
and that with great fruits as the result; for he says, "Thou shall beat him with the rod, and
shall deliver his soul from hell;"2510 and elsewhere he says, "He that spareth the rod hateth
his son."2511 For, give us a man who with right faith and true understanding can say with
all the energy of his heart, "My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come
and appear before God?"2512 and for such an one there is no need of the terror of hell, to
say nothing of temporal punishments or imperial laws, seeing that with him it is so indis-

pensable a blessing to cleave unto the Lord, that he not only dreads being parted from that
happiness as a heavy punishment, but can scarcely even bear delay in its attainment. But
yet, before the good sons can say they have "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ,"2513
many must first be recalled to their Lord by the stripes of temporal scourging, like evil slaves,
and in some degree like good-for-nothing fugitives.</p>
<p>22. For who can possibly love us more than Christ, who laid down His life for His
sheep?2514 And yet, after calling Peter and the other apostles by His words alone, when He
came to summon Paul, who was before called Saul, subsequently the powerful builder of
His Church, but originally its cruel persecutor, He not only constrained him with His voice,
but even dashed him to the earth with His power; and that He might forcibly bring one who
was raging amid the darkness of infidelity to desire the light of the heart, He first struck him
with physical blindness of the eyes. If that punishment had not been inflicted, he would
not afterwards have been healed by it; and since he had been wont to see nothing with his
eyes open, if they had remained unharmed, the Scripture would not tell us that at the imposition
of Ananias’ hands, in order that their sight might be restored, there fell from them as
it had been scales, by which the sight had been obscured.2515 Where is what the Donatists
were wont to cry: Man is at liberty to believe or not believe? Towards whom did Christ use
violence? Whom did He compel? Here they have the Apostle Paul. Let them recognize in
his case Christ first compelling, and afterwards teaching; first striking, and afterwards consoling.
For it is wonderful how he who entered the service of the gospel in the first instance
under the compulsion of bodily punishment, afterwards labored more in the gospel than
all they who were called by word only;2516 and he who was compelled by the greater influ
ence of fear to love, displayed that perfect love which casts out fear.</p>
<p>23. Why, therefore, should not the Church use force in compelling her lost sons to return,
if the lost sons compelled others to their destruction? Although even men who have
not been compelled, but only led astray, are received by their loving mother with more affection
if they are recalled to her bosom through the enforcement of terrible but salutary
laws, and are the objects of far more deep congratulation than those whom she had never
lost. Is it not a part of the care of the shepherd, when any sheep have left the flock, even
though not violently forced away, but led astray by tender words and coaxing blandishments,
to bring them back to the fold of his master when he has found them, by the fear or even
the pain of the whip, if they show symptoms of resistance; especially since, if they multiply
with growing abundance among the fugitive slaves and robbers, he has the more right in

<pb n="1279"/>
that the mark of the master is recognized on them, which is not outraged in those whom
we receive but do not rebaptize? For the wandering of the sheep is to be corrected in such
wise that the mark of the Redeemer should not be destroyed on it. For even if any one is
marked with the royal stamp by a deserter who is marked with it himself, and the two receive
forgiveness,2517 and the one returns to his service, and the other begins to be in the service
in which he had no part before, that mark is not effaced in either of the two, but rather it is
recognized in both of them, and approved with the honor which is due to it because it is the
king’s. Since then they cannot show that the destination is bad to which they are compelled,
they maintain that they ought to be compelled by force even to what is good. But we have
shown that Paul was compelled by Christ; therefore the Church, in trying to compel the
Donatists, is following the example of her Lord, though in the first instance she waited in
the hopes of needing to compel no one, that the prediction of the prophet might be fulfilled
concerning the faith of kings and peoples.</p>
<p>24. For in this sense also we may interpret without absurdity the declaration of the
blessed Apostle Paul, when he says, "Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when
your obedience is fulfilled."2518 Whence also the Lord Himself bids the guests in the first
instance to be invited to His great supper, and afterwards compelled; for on His servants
making answer to Him, "Lord, it is done as Thou hast commanded, and yet there is room,"
He said to them, "Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in."2519
In those, therefore, who were first brought in with gentleness, the former obedience is fulfilled;
but in those who were compelled, the disobedience is avenged. For what else is the
meaning of "Compel them to come in," after it had previously said, "Bring in," and the answer
had been made, "Lord, it is done as Thou commanded, and yet there is room"? If He had
wished it to be understood that they were to be compelled by the terrifying force of miracles,
many divine miracles were rather wrought in the sight of those who were first called, especially
in the sight of the Jews, of whom it was said, "The Jews require a sign;"2520 and,
moreover, among the Gentiles themselves the gospel was so commended by miracles in the
time of the apostles, that had these been the means by which they were ordered to be compelled,
we might rather have had good grounds for supposing, as I said before, that it was
the earlier guests who were compelled. Wherefore, if the power which the Church has received
by divine appointment in its due season, through the religious character and the faith
of kings, be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and hedges—that
is, in heresies and schisms—are compelled to come in, then let them not find fault with being

compelled, but consider whether they be so compelled. The supper of the Lord is the unity
of the body of Christ, not only in the sacrament of the altar, but also in the bond of peace.
Of the Donatists themselves, indeed, we can say that they compel no man to any good thing;
for whomsoever they compel, they compel to nothing else but evil.</p>

<p>25. However, before those laws were sent into Africa by which men are
compelled to come in to the sacred Supper, it seemed to certain of the brethren, of whom I
was one, that although the madness of the Donatists was raging in every direction, yet we
should not ask of the emperors to ordain that heresy should absolutely cease to be, by
sanctioning a punishment to be inflicted on all who wished to live in it; but that they should
rather content themselves with ordaining that those who either preached the Catholic truth
with their voice, or established it by their study, should no longer be exposed to the furious
violence of the heretics. And this they thought might in some measure be effected, if they
would take the law which Theodosius, of pious memory, enacted generally against heretics
of all kinds, to the effect that any heretical bishop or clergyman, being found in any place,
should be fined ten pounds of gold, and confirm it in more express terms against the
Donatists, who denied that they were heretics; but with such reservations, that the fine
should not be inflicted upon all of them, but only in those districts where the Catholic
Church suffered any violence from their clergy, or from the Circumcelliones, or at the hands
of any of their people; so that after a formal complaint had been made by the Catholics who
had suffered the violence, the bishops or other ministers should forthwith be obliged, under
the commission given to the officers, to pay the fine. For we thought that in this way, if they
were terrified and no longer dared do anything of the sort, the Catholic truth might be freely
taught and held under such conditions, that while no one was compelled to it, any one might
follow it who was anxious to do so without intimidation, so that we might not have false
and pretended Catholics. And although a different view was held by other brethren, who
either were more advanced in years, or had experience of many states and places where we
saw the true Catholic Church firmly established, which had, however, been planted and
confirmed by God’s great goodness at a time when men were compelled to come in to the
Catholic communion by the laws of previous emperors, yet we carried our point, to the effect
that the measure which I have described above should be sought in preference from the
emperors: it was decreed in our council, 2521 and envoys were sent to the court of the Count.</p>
<p>26. But God in His great mercy, knowing how necessary was the terror inspired by
these laws, and a kind of medicinal inconvenience for the cold and wicked hearts of many
men, and for that hardness of heart which cannot be softened by words, but yet admits of
softening through the agency of some little severity of discipline, brought it about that our
envoys could not obtain what they had undertaken to ask. For our arrival had already been
anticipated by the serious complaints of certain bishops from other districts, who had
suffered much ill-treatment at the hands of the Donatists themselves, and had been thrust
out from their sees; and, in particular, the attempt to murder Maximianus, the Catholic
bishop of the Church of Bagai, under circumstances of incredible atrocity, had caused
2521 That of Carthage, held June 26 (more correctly, probably June 15th or 16th), 401.

<pb n="1282"/>
measures to be taken which left our deputation nothing to do. For a law had already been
published, that the heresy of the Donatists, being of so savage a description that mercy towards
it really involved greater cruelty than its very madness wrought, should for the future
be prevented not only from being violent, but from existing with impunity at all; but yet no
capital punishment was imposed upon it, that even in dealing with those who were unworthy,
Christian gentleness might be observed, but a pecuniary fine was ordained, and sentence
of exile was pronounced against their bishops or ministers.</p>
<p>27. With regard to the aforesaid bishop of Bagai, in consequence of his claim being allowed
in the ordinary courts, after each party had been heard in turn, in a basilica2522 of
which the Donatists had taken possession, as being the property of the Catholics, they rushed
upon him as he was standing at the altar, with fearful violence and cruel fury, beat him
savagely with cudgels and weapons of every kind, and at last with the very boards of the
broken altar. They also wounded him with a dagger in the groin so severely, that the effusion
of blood would have soon put an end to his life, had not their further cruelty proved of service
for its preservation; for, as they were dragging him along the ground thus severely wounded,
the dust forced into the spouting vein stanched the blood, whose effusion was rapidly on
the way to cause his death. Then, when they had at length abandoned him, some of our
party tried to carry him off with psalms; but his enemies, inflamed with even greater rage,
tore him from the hands of those who were carrying him, inflicting grievous punishment
on the Catholics, whom they put to flight, being far superior to them in numbers, and easily
inspiring terror by their violence. Finally, they threw him into a certain elevated tower,
thinking that he was by this time dead, though in fact he still breathed. Lighting then on a
soft heap of earth, and being espied by the light of a lamp by some men who were passing
by at night, he was recognized and picked up, and being carried to a religious house, by dint
of great care, was restored in a few days from his state of almost hopeless danger. Rumor,
however, had carried the tidings even across the sea that he had been killed by the violence
of the Donatists; and when afterwards he himself went abroad, and was most unexpectedly
seen to be alive, he showed, by the number, the severity, and the freshness of his wounds,
how fully rumor had been justified in bringing tidings of his death.</p>
<p>28. He sought assistance, therefore, from the Christian emperor, not so much with any
desire of revenging himself, as with the view of defending the Church entrusted to his charge.
And if he had omitted to do this, he would have deserved not to be praised for his forbearance,
but to be blamed for negligence. For neither was the Apostle Paul taking precautions
on behalf of his own transitory life, but for the Church of God when he caused the plot of
those who had conspired to slay him to be made known to the Roman captain, the effect of
which was that he was conducted by an escort of armed soldiers to the place where they
<note type="footnote">2522 The basilica of Fundus Calvianensis. See C. Crescon. iii. c. 43.</note>

<pb n="1283"/>
proposed to send him, that he might escape the ambush of his foes.2523 Nor did he for a
moment hesitate to invoke the protection of the Roman laws, proclaiming that he was a
Roman citizen, who at that time could not be scourged;2524 and again, that he might not be
delivered to the Jews who sought to kill him, he appealed to Cæsar,2525—a Roman emperor,
indeed, but not a Christian. And by this he showed sufficiently plainly what was afterwards
to be the duty of the ministers of Christ, when in the midst of the dangers of the Church
they found the emperors Christians. And hence therefore, it came about that a religious
and pious emperor, when such matters were brought to his knowledge, thought it well, by
the enactment of most pious laws, entirely to correct the error of this great impiety, and to
bring those who bore the standards of Christ against the cause of Christ into the unity of
the Catholic Church, even by terror and compulsion, rather than merely to take away their
power of doing violence, and to leave them the freedom of going astray, and perishing in
their error.</p>
<p>29. Presently, when the laws themselves arrived in Africa, in the first place those who
were already seeking an opportunity for doing so, or were afraid of the raging madness of
the Donatists, or were previously deterred by a feeling of unwillingness to offend their
friends, at once came over to the Church. Many, too, who were only restrained by the force
of custom handed down in their homes from their parents, but had never before considered
what was the groundwork of the heresy itself,—had never, indeed, wished to investigate and
contemplate its nature,—beginning now to use their observation, and finding nothing in it
that could compensate for such serious loss as they were called upon to suffer, became
Catholics without any difficulty; for, having been made careless by security, they were now
instructed by anxiety. But when all these had set the example, it was followed by many who
were less qualified of themselves to understand what was the difference between the error
of the Donatists and Catholic truth.</p>
<p>30. Accordingly, when the great masses of the people had been received by the true
mother with rejoicing into her bosom, there remained outside cruel crowds, persevering
with unhappy animosity in that madness. Even of these the greater number communicated
in feigned reconciliation, and others escaped notice from the scantiness of their numbers.
But those who feigned conformity, becoming by degrees accustomed to our communion,
and hearing the preaching of the truth, especially after the conference and disputation which
took place between us and their bishops at Carthage, were to a great extent brought to a
right belief. Yet in certain places, where a more obstinate and implacable body prevailed,
whom the smaller number that entertained better views about communion with us could

<pb n="1284"/>
not resist, or where the masses were under the influence of a few more powerful leaders,
whom they followed in a wrong direction, our difficulties continued somewhat longer. Of
these places there are a few in which trouble still exists, in the course of which the Catholics,
and especially the bishops and clergy, have suffered many terrible hardships, which it would
take too long to go through in detail, seeing that some of them had their eyes put out, and
one bishop his hands and tongue cut off, while some were actually murdered. I say nothing
of massacres of the most cruel description, and robberies of houses, committed in nocturnal
burglaries, with the burning not only of private houses, but even of churches,—some being
found abandoned enough to cast the sacred books into the flames.</p>
<p>31. But we were consoled for the suffering inflicted on us by these evils, by the fruit
which resulted from them. For wherever such deeds were committed by unbelievers, there
Christian unity has advanced with greater fervency and perfection, and the Lord is praised
with greater earnestness for having deigned to grant that His servants might win their
brethren by their sufferings, and might gather together into the peace of eternal salvation
through His blood His sheep who were dispersed abroad in deadly error. The Lord is
powerful and full of compassion, to whom we daily pray that He will give repentance to the
rest as well, that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, by whom they
are taken captive at his will,2526 though now they only seek materials for calumniating us,
and returning to us evil for good; because they have not the knowledge to make them understand
what feelings and love we continue to have towards them, and how we are anxious,
in accordance with the injunction of the Lord, given to His pastors by the mouth of the
prophet Ezekiel, to bring again that which was driven away, and to seek that which was
lost.2527</p>

<p>32. But they, as we have sometimes said before in other places, do not
charge themselves with what they do to us; while, on the other hand, they charge us with
what they do to themselves. For which of our party is there who would desire, I do not say
that one of them should perish, but should even lose any of his possessions? But if the house
of David could not earn peace on any other terms except that Absalom his son should have
been slain in the war which he was waging against his father, although he had most carefully
given strict injunctions to his followers that they should use their utmost endeavors to preserve
him alive and safe, that his paternal affection might be able to pardon him on his repentance,
what remained for him except to weep for the son that he had lost, and to console
himself in his sorrow by reflecting on the acquisition of peace for his kingdom?2528 The
same, then, is the case with the Catholic Church, our mother; for when war is waged against
her by men who are certainly different from sons, since it must be acknowledged that from
the great tree, which by the spreading of its branches is extended over all the world, this
little branch in Africa is broken off, whilst she is willing in her love to give them birth, that
they may return to the root, without which they cannot have the true life, at the same time
if she collects the remainder in so large a number by the loss of some, she soothes and cures
the sorrow of her maternal heart by the thoughts of the deliverance of such mighty nations;
especially when she considers that those who are lost perish by a death which they brought
upon themselves, and not, like Absalom, by the fortune of war. And if you were to see the
joy of those who are delivered in the peace of Christ, their crowded assemblies, their eager
zeal, the gladsomeness with which they flock together, both to hear and sing hymns, and to
be instructed in the word of God; the great grief with which many of them recall to mind
their former error, the joy with which they come to the consideration of the truth which
they have learned, with the indignation and detestation which they feel towards their lying
teachers, now that they have found out what falsehoods they disseminated concerning our
sacraments; and how many of them, moreover, acknowledge that they long ago desired to
be Catholics, but dared not take the step in the midst of men of such violence,—if, I say,
you were to see the congregations of these nations delivered from such perdition, then you
would say that it would have been the extreme of cruelty, if in the fear that certain desperate
men, in number not to be compared with the multitudes of those who were rescued, might
be burned in fires which they voluntarily kindled for themselves, these others had been left
to be lost for ever, and to be tortured in fires which shall not be quenched.</p>
<p>33. For if two men were dwelling together in one house, which we knew with absolute
certainty to be upon the point of falling down, and they were unwillingly to believe us when
we warned them of the danger, and persisted in remaining in the house; if it were in our
power to rescue them, even against their will, and we were afterwards to show them the
<note type="footnote">2528 2 Sam. xviii., xxii.</note>

<pb n="1286"/>
ruin threatening their house, so that they should not dare to return again within its reach,
I think that if we abstained from doing it, we should well deserve the charge of cruelty. And
further, if one of them should say to us, Since you have entered the house to save our lives,
I shall forthwith kill myself; while the other was not indeed willing to come forth from the
house, nor to be rescued, but yet had not the hardihood to kill himself: which alternative
should we choose,—to leave both of them to be overwhelmed in the ruin, or that, while one
at any rate was delivered by our merciful efforts, the other should perish by no fault of ours,
but rather by his own? No one is so unhappy as not to find it easy enough to deride what
should be done in such a case. And I have proposed the question of two individuals,—one,
that is to say, who is lost, and one who is delivered; what then must we think of the case
where some few are lost, and an innumerable multitude of nations are delivered? For there
are actually not so many persons who thus perish of their own free will, as there are estates,
villages, streets, fortresses, municipal towns, cities, that are delivered by the laws under
consideration from that fatal and eternal destruction.</p>
<p>34. But if we were to consider the matter under discussion with yet greater care, I think
that if there were a large number of persons in the house which was going to fall, and any
single one of them could be saved, and when we endeavored to effect his rescue, the others
were to kill themselves by jumping out of the windows, we should console ourselves in our
grief for the loss of the rest by the thoughts of the safety of the one; and we should not allow
all to perish without a single rescue, in the fear lest the remainder should destroy themselves.
What then should we think of the work of mercy to which we ought to apply ourselves, in
order that men may attain eternal life and escape eternal punishment, if true reason and
benevolence compel us to give such aid to men, in order to secure for them a safety which
is not only temporal, but very short,—for the brief space of their life on earth?</p>

<p>35. As to the charge that they bring against us, that we covet and plunder
their possessions, I would that they would become Catholics, and possess in peace and love
with us, not only what they call theirs, but also what confessedly belongs to us. But they are
so blinded with the desire of uttering calumnies, that they do not observe how inconsistent
their statements are with one another. At any rate, they assert, and seem to make it a subject
of most invidious complaint among themselves, that we constrain them to come in to our
communion by the violent authority of the laws,—which we certainly should not do by any
means, if we wished to gain possession of their property. What avaricious man ever wished
for another to share his possessions? Who that was inflamed with the desire of empire, or
elated by the pride of its possession, ever wished to have a partner? Let them at any rate
look on those very men who once belonged to them, but now are our brethren joined to us
by the bond of fraternal affection, and see how they hold not only what they used to have,
but also what was ours, which they did not have before; which yet, if we are living as poor
in fellowship with poor, belongs to us and them alike; whilst, if we possess of our private
means enough for our wants, it is no longer ours, inasmuch as we do not commit so infamous
an act of usurpation as to claim for our own the property of the poor, for whom we are in
some sense the trustees.</p>
<p>36. Everything, therefore, that was held in the name of the churches of the party of
Donatus, was ordered by the Christian emperors, in their pious laws, to pass to the Catholic
Church, with the possession of the buildings themselves.2529 Seeing, then, that there are
with us poor members of those said churches who used to be maintained by these same
paltry possessions, let them rather cease themselves to covet what belongs to others whilst
they remain outside, and so let them enter within the bond of unity, that we may all alike
administer, not only the property which they call their own, but also with it what is asserted
to be ours. For it is written "All are yours; and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s."2530
Under Him as our Head, let us all be one in His one body; and in all such matters as you
speak of, let us follow the example which is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: "They were
of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that aught of the things which he
possessed was his own; but they had all things common."2531 Let us love what we sing:
"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"2532 that
so they may know, by their own experience, with what perfect truth their mother, the
Catholic Church, calls out to them what the blessed apostle writes to the Corinthians: "I
seek not yours, but you."2533</p>

<p>37. But if we consider what is said in the Book of Wisdom, "Therefore the righteous
spoiled the ungodly;"2534 and also what is said in the Proverbs, "The wealth of the sinner is
laid up for the just;"2535 then we shall see that the question is not, who are in possession of
the property of the heretics? but who are in the society of the just? We know, indeed, that
the Donatists arrogate to themselves such a store of justice, that they boast not only that
they possess it, but that they also bestow it upon other men. For they say that any one whom
they have baptized is justified by them, after which there is nothing left for them but to say
to the person who is baptized by them that he must needs believe on him who has administered
the sacrament; for why should he not do so, when the apostle says, "To him that believeth
on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness?"2536 Let
him believe, therefore, upon the man by whom he is baptized, if it be none else that justifies
him, that his faith may be counted for righteousness. But I think that even they themselves
would look with horror on themselves, if they ventured for a moment to entertain such
thoughts as these. For there is none that is just and able to justify, save God alone. But the
same might be said of them that the apostle says of the Jews, that "being ignorant of God’s
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted
themselves unto the righteousness of God."2537</p>
<p>38. But far be it from us that any one of our number should call himself in such wise
just, that he should either go about to establish his own righteousness, as though it were
conferred upon him by himself, whereas it is said to him, "For what hast thou that thou
didst not receive?"2538 or venture to boast himself as being without sin in this world, as the
Donatists themselves declared in our conference that they were members of a Church which
has already neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing,2539—not knowing that this is only
fulfilled in those individuals who depart out of this body immediately after baptism, or after
the forgiveness of sins, for which we make petition in our prayers; but that for the Church,
as a whole, the time will not come when it shall be altogether without spot or wrinkle, or
any such thing, till the day when we shall hear the words, "O death, where is thy sting? O
grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin." 2540</p>
<p>39. But in this life, when the corruptible body presseth down the soul,2541 if their Church
is already of such a character as they maintain, they would not utter unto God the prayer

<pb n="1289"/>
which our Lord has taught us to employ: "Forgive us our debts."2542 For since all sins have
been remitted in baptism, why does the Church make this petition, if already, even in this
life, it has neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing? They would also have a fight to
despise the warning of the Apostle John, when he cries out in his epistle, "If we say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, He
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."2543
On account of this hope, the universal Church utters the petition, "Forgive us our debts,"
that when He sees that we are not vainglorious, but ready to confess our sins, He may cleanse
us from all unrighteousness, and that so the Lord Jesus Christ may show to Himself in that
day a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, which now He cleanses
with the washing of water in the word: because, on the one hand, there is nothing that remains
behind in baptism to hinder the forgiveness of every bygone sin (so long, that is, as
baptism is not received to no effect without the Church, but is either administered within
the Church, or, at least, if it has been already administered without, the recipient does not
remain outside with it); and, on the other hand, whatever pollution of sin, of whatsoever
kind, is contracted through the weakness of human nature by those who live here after
baptism, is cleansed away in virtue of the same laver’s efficacy. For neither is it of any avail
for one who has not been baptized to say, "Forgive us our debts."</p>
<p>40. Accordingly, He so now cleanses His Church by the washing of water in the word,
that He may hereafter show it to Himself as not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing,—altogether beautiful, that is to say, and in absolute perfection, when death shall be
"swallowed up in victory."2544 Now, therefore, in so far as the life is flourishing within us
that proceeds from our being born of God, living by faith, so far we are righteous; but in so
far as we drag along with us the traces of our mortal nature as derived from Adam, so far
we cannot be free from sin. For there is truth both in the statement that "whosoever is born
of God doth not commit sin,"2545 and also in the former statement, that "if we say that we
have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."2546 The Lord Jesus, therefore,
is both righteous and able to justify; but we are justified freely by no other grace than His.2547
For there is nothing that justifieth save His body, which is the Church; and therefore, if the
body of Christ bears off the spoils of the unrighteous, and the riches of the unrighteous are

laid up in store as treasures for the body of Christ, the unrighteous ought not therefore to
remain outside, but rather to enter within, that so they may be justified.</p>
<p>41. Whence also we may be sure that what is written concerning the day of judgment,
"Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted
him, and made no account of his labors,"2548 is not to be taken in such a sense as that the
Canaanite shall stand before the face of Israel, though Israel made no account of the labors
of the Canaanite; but only as that Naboth shall stand before the face of Ahab, since Ahab
made no account of the labors of Naboth, since the Canaanite was unrighteous, while Naboth
was a righteous man. In the same way the heathen shall not stand before the face of the
Christian, who made no account of his labors, when the temples of the idols were plundered
and destroyed; but the Christian shall stand before the face of the heathen, who made no
account of his labors, when the bodies of the martyrs were laid low in death. In the same
way, therefore, the heretic shall not stand in the face of the Catholic, who made no account
of his labors, when the laws of the Catholic emperors were put in force; but the Catholic
shall stand in the face of the heretic, who made no account of his labors when the madness
of the ungodly Circumcelliones was allowed to have its way. For the passage of Scripture
decides the question in itself, seeing that it does not say, Then shall men stand, but "Then
shall the righteous stand;" and they shall stand "in great boldness" because they stand in the
power of a good conscience.</p>
<p>42. But in this world no one is righteous by his own righteousness,—that is, as though
it were wrought by himself and for himself; but as the apostle says, "According as God hath
dealt to every man the measure of faith." But then he goes on to add the following: "For as
we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office; so we, being
many, are one body in Christ."2549 And according to this doctrine, no one can be righteous
so long as he is separated from the unity of this body. For in the same manner as if a limb
be cut off from the body of a living man, it cannot any longer retain the spirit of life; so the
man who is cut off from the body of Christ, who is righteous, can in no wise retain the
spirit of righteousness, even if he retain the form of membership which he received when
in the body. Let them therefore come into the framework of this body, and so possess their
own labors, not through the lust of lordship, but through the godliness of using them aright.
But we, as has been said before, cleanse our wills from the pollution of this concupiscence,
even in the judgment of any enemy you please to name as judge, seeing that we use our utmost
efforts in entreating the very men of whose labors we avail ourselves to enjoy with us,
within the society of the Catholic Church, the fruits both of their labors and of our own.</p>

<p>43. But this, they say, is the very thing which disquiets us,—If we are
unrighteous, wherefore do you seek our company? To which question we answer, We seek
the company of you who are unrighteous, that you may not remain unrighteous; we seek
for you who are lost, that we may rejoice over you as soon as you are found, saying, This
our brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. 2550 Why, then, he says,
do you not baptize me, that you might wash me from my sins? I reply: Because I do not
do despite to the stamp of the monarch, when I correct the ill-doing of a deserter. Why, he
says, do I not even do penance in your body? Nay truly, except you have done penance,
you cannot be saved; for how shall you rejoice that you have been reformed, unless you first
grieve that you had been astray? What, then, he says, do we receive with you, when we come
over to your side? I answer, You do not indeed receive baptism, which was able to exist in
you outside the framework of the body of Christ, although it could not profit you; but you
receive the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace2551 without which no one can see God;
and you receive charity, which, as it is written, "shall cover the multitude of sins."2552 And
in regard to this great blessing, without which we have the apostle’s testimony that neither
the tongues of men or of angels, nor the understanding of all mysteries, nor the gift of
prophecy, nor faith so great as to be able to remove mountains, nor the bestowal of all one’s
goods to feed the poor, nor giving one’s body to be burned, can profit anything;2553 if, I say,
you think this mighty blessing to be worthless or of trifling value, you are deservedly but
miserably astray; and deservedly you must necessarily perish, unless you come over to
Catholic unity.</p>
<p>44. If, then, they say, it is necessary that we should repent of having been outside, and
hostile to the Church, if we would gain salvation, how comes it that after the repentance
which you exact from us we still continue to be clergy, or it may be even bishops in your
body? This would not be the case, as indeed, in simple truth, we must confess it should not
be the case, were it not that the evil is cured by the compensating power of peace itself. But
let them give themselves this lesson, and most especially let those feel sorrow in their hearts,
who are lying in this deep death of severance from the Church, that they may recover their
life even by this sort of wound inflicted on our Catholic mother Church. For when the
bough that has been cut off is grafted in, a new wound is made in the tree, to admit of its
reception, that life may be given to the branch which was perishing for lack of the life that
is furnished by the root. But when the newly-received branch has become identified with
the stock in which it is received, the result is both vigor and fruit; but if they do not become

<note type="footnote">2553 1 Cor. xiii. 1-3.</note>

<pb n="1292"/>
identified, the engrafted bough withers, but the life of the tree continues unimpaired. For
there is further a mode of grafting of such a kind, that without cutting away any branch that
is within, the branch that is foreign to the tree is inserted, not indeed without a wound, but
with the slightest possible wound inflicted on the tree. In like manner, then, when they
come to the root which exists in the Catholic Church, without being deprived of any position
which belongs to them as clergy or bishops after ever so deep repentance of their error, there
is a kind of wound inflicted as it were upon the bark of the mother tree, breaking in upon
the strictness of her discipline; but since neither he that planteth is anything, neither he that
watereth,2554 so soon as by prayers poured forth to the mercy of God peace is secured
through the union of the engrafted boughs with the parent stock, charity then covers the
multitude of sins.</p>
<p>45. For although it was made an ordinance in the Church, that no one who had been
called upon to do penance for any offense should be admired into holy orders, or return to
or continue in the body of the clergy,2555 this was done not to cause despair of any indulgence
being granted, but merely to maintain a rigorous discipline; otherwise an argument will be
raised against the keys that were given to the Church, of which we have the testimony of
Scripture: "Whatsoever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."2556 But lest it
should so happen that, after the detection of offenses, a heart swelling with the hope of ecclesiastical
preferment might do penance in a spirit of pride, it was determined, with great
severity, that after doing penance for any mortal sin, no one should be admitted to the
number of the clergy, in order that, when all hope of temporal preferment was done away,
the medicine of humility might be endowed with greater strength and truth. For even the
holy David did penance for deadly sin, and yet was not degraded from his office. And we
know that the blessed Peter, after shedding the bitterest of tears, repented that he had denied
his Lord, and yet remained an apostle. But we must not therefore be induced to think that
the care of those in later times was in any way superfluous, who, when there was no risk of
endangering salvation, added something to humiliation, in order that the salvation might
be more thoroughly protected,—having, I suppose, experienced a feigned repentance on
the part of some who were influenced by the desire of the power attaching to office. For
experience in many diseases necessarily brings in the invention of many remedies. But in
cases of this kind, when, owing to the serious ruptures of dissensions in the Church, it is no
longer a question of danger to this or that particular individual, but whole nations are lying

<pb n="1293"/>
in ruin, it is right to yield a little from our severity, that true charity may give her aid in
healing the more serious evils.</p>
<p>46. Let them therefore feel bitter grief for their detestable error of the past, as Peter did
for his fear that led him into falsehood, and let them come to the true Church of Christ, that
is, to the Catholic Church our mother; let them be in it clergy, let them be bishops unto its
profit, as they have been hitherto in enmity against it. We feel no jealousy towards them,
nay, we embrace them; we wish, we advise, we even compel those to come in whom we find
in the highways and hedges, although we fail as yet in persuading some of them that we are
seeking not their property, but themselves. The Apostle Peter, when he denied his Savior,
and wept, and did not cease to be an apostle, had not as yet received the Holy Spirit that
was promised; but much more have these men not received Him, when, being severed from
the framework of the body, which is alone enlivened by the Holy Spirit, they have usurped
the sacraments of the Church outside the Church and in hostility to the Church, and have
fought against us in a kind of civil war, with our own arms and our own standards raised
in opposition to us. Let them come; let peace be concluded in the virtue of Jerusalem, which
virtue is Christian charity,—to which holy city it is said, "Peace be in thy virtue, and
plenteousness within thy palaces."2557 Let them not exalt themselves against the solicitude
of their mother, which she both has entertained and does entertain with the object of gathering
within her bosom themselves, and all the mighty nations whom they are, or recently
were, deceiving; at them not be puffed up with pride, that she receives them in such wise;
let them not attribute to the evil of their own exaltation the good which she on her part does
in order to make peace.</p>
<p>47. So it has been her wont to come to the aid of multitudes who were perishing through
schisms and heresies. This displeased Lucifer,2558 when it was carried out in receiving and
healing those who had perished beneath the poison of the Arian heresy; and, being displeased
at it, he fell into the darkness of schism, losing the light of Christian charity. In accordance
with this principle the Church of Africa has recognized the Donatists from the very beginning,
obeying herein the decree of the bishops who gave sentence in the Church at Rome between
Cæcilianus and the party of Donatus; and having condemned one bishop named Donatus,2559
who was proved to have been the author of the schism, they determined that the others
should be received, after correction, with full recognition of their orders even if they had
been ordained outside the Church,—not that they could have the Holy Spirit even outside
the unity of the body of Christ, but, in the first place, for the sake of those whom it was
possible they might deceive while they remained outside, and prevent from obtaining that

gift; and, secondly, that their own weakness also being mercifully received within, might
thus be rendered capable of cure, no obstinacy any longer standing in the way to close their
eyes against the evidence of truth. For what other intention could have given rise to their
own conduct, when they received with full recognition of their orders the followers of
Maximianus, whom they had condemned as guilty of sacrilegious schism, as their council2560
shows, and to fill whose places they had already ordained other men, when they saw that
the people did not depart from their company, that all might not be involved in ruin? And
on what other ground did they neither speak against nor question the validity of the baptism
which had been administered outside by men whom they had condemned? Why, then, do
they wonder, why do they complain, and make it the subject of their calumnies, that we receive
them in such wise to promote the true peace of Christ, while yet they do not remember
what they themselves have done to promote the false peace of Donatus, which is opposed
to Christ? For if this act of theirs be borne in mind, and intelligently used in argument
against them, they will have no answer whatsoever that they can make.</p>

<p>48. But as to what they say, arguing as follows: If we have sinned against
the Holy Ghost, in that we have treated your baptism with contempt, why is it that you seek
us, seeing that we cannot possibly receive remission of this sin, as the Lord says, "Whosoever
speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither
in the world to come?"2561—they do not perceive that according to their interpretation of
the passage none can be delivered. For who is there that does not speak against the Holy
Ghost and sin against him, whether we take the case of one who is not yet a Christian, or
of one who shares in the heresy of Arius, or of Eunomius, or of Macedonius, who all say
that He is a creature; or of Photinus, who denies that He has any substance at all, saying
that there is only one God, the Father; or of any of the other heretics, whom it would now
take too long a time to mention in detail? Are none, therefore, of these to be delivered? Or
if the Jews themselves, against whom the Lord directed His reproach, were to believe in
Him, would they not be allowed to be baptized? for the Saviour does not say, Shall be forgiven
in baptism: but "Shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."</p>
<p>49. Let them understand, therefore, that it is not every sin, but only some sin, against
the Holy Ghost which is incapable of forgiveness. For just as when our Lord said, "If I had
not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin,"2562 it is clear that He did not wish
it to be understood that they would have been free from all sin, since they were filled with
many grievous sins, but that they would have been free from some special sin, the absence
of which would have left them in a position to receive remission of all the sins which yet
remained in them, viz., the sin of not believing in Him when He came to them; for they
could not have had this sin, had He not come. In like manner, also, when He said, "Whosoever
sinneth against the Holy Ghost,"or, "Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost;" it
is clear that He does not refer to every sin of whatsoever kind against the Holy Ghost, in
word or deed, but would have us understand some special and peculiar sin. But this is the
hardness of heart even to the end of this life, which leads a man to refuse to accept remission
of his sins in the unity of the body of Christ, to which life is given by the Holy Ghost. For
when He had said to His disciples "Receive the Holy Ghost," immediately added, Whosesoever
sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained."
2563 Whosoever therefore has resisted or fought against this gift of the grace of God,
or has been estranged from it in any way whatever to the end of this mortal life, shall not
receive the remission of that sin, either in this world, or in the world to come, seeing that it

<note type="footnote">2563 John xx. 22, 23.</note>

<pb n="1296"/>
is so great a sin that in it is included every sin; but it cannot be proved to have been committed
by any one, till he has passed away from life. But so long as he lives here, "the goodness of
God," as the apostle says, "is leading him to repentance;" but if he deliberately, with the utmost
perseverance in iniquity, as the apostle adds in the succeeding verse, "after his hardness and
impenitent heart, treasures up unto himself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation
of the righteous judgment of God,"2564 he shall not receive forgiveness, neither in this world,
neither in that which is to come.</p>
<p>50. But those with whom we are arguing, or about whom we are arguing, are not to be
despaired of, for they are yet in the body; but they cannot seek the Holy Spirit, except in the
body of Christ, of which they possess the outward sign outside the Church, but they do not
possess the actual reality itself within the Church of which that is the outward sign, and
therefore they eat and drink damnation to themselves.2565 For there is but one bread which
is the sacrament of unity, seeing that, as the apostle says, "We, being many, are one bread,
and one body."2566 Furthermore, the Catholic Church alone is the body of Christ, of which
He is the Head and Saviour of His body.2567 Outside this body the Holy Spirit giveth life
to no one seeing that, as the apostle says himself, "The love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us;"2568 but he is not a partaker of the divine
love who is the enemy of unity. Therefore they have not the Holy Ghost who are outside
the Church; for it is written of them, "They separate themselves being sensual, having not
the Spirit."2569 But neither does he receive it who is insincerely in the Church, since this is
also the intent of what is written: "For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit."2570 If
any one, therefore, wishes to receive the Holy Spirit, let him beware of continuing in alienation
from the Church, let him beware of entering it in the spirit of dissimulation; or if he
has already entered it in such wise, let him beware of persisting in such dissimulation, in
order that he may truly and indeed become united with the tree of life.</p>

among your many occupations. If, therefore, it may be read to you even in portions, the

<head>You might also enjoy these classic Christian books from the CCEL:
NPNF1-05. St. Augustine: Anti-Pelagian Writings by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series. The
first series focuses on two classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John
Chrysostom. St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian thinkers
of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two works--the Confessions and the
City of God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine,
such as On the Holy Trinity, Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom
was an eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a more literal
interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity,
particularly what is now called social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged
abuses of authority. This volume contains the majority of Augustine's writings against the
Pelagians. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope, and provide keen
translations of instructive and illuminating texts from some of the greatest theologians of
the Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for over a
thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even today!</p>

<head>ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus by
Philip Schaff</head>
<p>Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene Fathers, brings together the
work of early Christian thinkers. In particular, it brings together the writings of the early
Church fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These volumes are noteworthy
for their inclusion of entire texts, and not simply fragments or excerpts from these great
writings. The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and scholars with a good
approximation of the originals. This particular volume contains works by St. Clement,
Mathetes, St. Polycarp, St. Ignatius, Barnabas, St. Papias, St. Justin Martyr, and St. Irenaeus.
These writings were heavily influential on the early Church, and for good reason, as they
are inspirational and encouraging. These volumes also come with many useful notes,
providing the reader with new levels of understanding. Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, or any
part of it, is a welcome addition to one's reading list.</p>

<head>ANF05. Fathers of the Third Century: Hippolytus,
Cyprian, Caius, Novatian, Appendix</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene
Fathers, brings together the work of early Christian thinkers.
In particular, it brings together the writings of the early Church
fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These
volumes are noteworthy for their inclusion of entire texts, and
not simply fragments or excerpts from these great writings.
The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and
scholars with a good approximation of the originals. This
volume contains works by third century thinkers St. Hippolytus,
St. Cyprian, Caius, and Novatian. These writings were
heavily influential on the early Church, and for good reason,
as they are inspirational and encouraging. These volumes
also come with many useful notes, providing the reader with
new levels of understanding. Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers,
or any part of it, is a welcome addition to one's reading list.

<p>That idols are not gods, and that the elements are not to be worshipped in the
place of gods.1139</p>
<p>That God alone must be worshipped. 1140</p>
<p>What is God's threatening against those who sacrifice to idols? 1141</p>
<p>That God does not easily pardon idolaters. 1142</p>
<p>That God is so angry against idolatry, that He has even enjoined those to be 
slain who persuade others to sacrifice and serve idols.1143</p>
<p>That, being redeemed and quickened by the blood of Christ, we ought to
prefer nothing to Christ.1145</p>
<p>That those who are snatched from the jaws of the devil, and delivered from
the snares of this world, ought not again to return to the world, lest they should
lose the advantage of their withdrawal therefrom.1146</p>
<p>That we must press on and persevere in faith and virtue, and in completion
of heavenly and spiritual grace, that we may attain to the palm and the crown.1147</p>
<p>That afflictions and persecutions arise for the sake of our being proved. 1149</p>
<p>That injuries and penalties of persecutions are not to be feared by us, because
greater is the Lord to protect than the devil to assault.1150</p>
<p>That it was before predicted that the world would hold us in abhorrence, and
that it would stir up persecutions against us, and that no new thing is
happening to the Christians, since from the beginning of the world the good
have suffered, and the righteous have been oppressed and slain by the
unrighteous.1152</p>
<p>What hope and reward remains for the righteous and for martyrs after the
conflicts and sufferings of this present time.1158</p>

<p>Three Books of Testimonies Against the Jews. 1162</p>
<p>Preface. 1162</p>
<p>Book I. 1163</p>
<p>Heads. 1163</p>
<p>That the Jews have fallen under the heavy wrath of God because they have forsaken 
the Lord, and have followed idols.1165</p>
<p>Also because they did not believe the prophets, and put them to death. 1166</p>
<p>That it was previously foretold that they would neither know the Lord, nor
understand, nor receive Him.1167</p>
<p>That the Jews would not understand the Holy Scriptures, but that they would be
intelligible in the last times, after that Christ had come.1169</p>
<p>That the Jews could understand nothing of the Scriptures unless they first believed
in Christ.1170</p>
<p>That the Jews should lose Jerusalem, and should leave the land which they had
received.1171</p>
<p>Also that they should lose the Light of the Lord. 1172</p>
<p>That the first circumcision of the flesh is made void, and the second circumcision
of the spirit is promised instead. 1173</p>
<p>That the former law which was given by Moses was to cease. 1174</p>
<p>That a new law was to be given. 1175</p>
<p>That another dispensation and a new covenant was to be given. 1176</p>
<p>That the old baptism should cease, and a new one should begin. 1177</p>
<p>That the old yoke should be made void, and a new yoke should be given. 1178</p>
<p>That the old pastors should cease and new ones begin. 1179</p>
<p>That Christ should be the house and temple of God, and that the old temple should 
cease, and the new one should begin.1180</p>
<p>That the ancient sacrifice should be made void, and a new one should be celebrated. 1181</p>
<p>That the old priesthood should cease, and a new priest should come, who should
be for ever.1182</p>
<p>That another Prophet such as Moses was promised, to wit, one who should give a
new testament, and who rather ought to be heard.</p>
<p>That two peoples were foretold, the elder and the younger; that is, the old people of
the Jews, and the new one which should consist of us.1184</p>

<pb n="xxiv"/>
<p>That the Church which before had been barren should have more children from
among the Gentiles than what the synagogue had had before.1185</p>
<p>That the Gentiles should rather believe in Christ. 1186</p>

and all His grace, and that the new name of Christians should be blessed in the earth.1189</p>
<p>That the Gentiles rather than the Jews attain to the kingdom of heaven. 1190</p>

begotten again according to the flesh. 1203</p>
<p>That this should be the sign of His nativity, that He should be born of a virgin--man
and God--a son of man and a Son of God.1204</p>

children were to be born.1217</p>
<p>That the Jews would fasten Christ to the cross. 1219</p>

foreheads.1221</p>

power should be everlasting.1225</p>

kingdom of God.1276</p>
<p>That it is of small account to be baptized and to receive the Eucharist, unless one
profit by it both in deeds and works.1277</p>
<p>That even a baptized person loses the grace that he has attained, unless he keep
innocency.1278</p>
<p>That remission cannot in the Church be granted unto him who has sinned against
God (i.e., the Holy Ghost).1279</p>
<p>That it was before predicted, concerning the hatred of the Name. 1280</p>
<p>That what any one has vowed to God, he must quickly repay. 1281</p>
<p>That he who does not believe is judged already. 1282

<p>That the Father judgeth nothing, but the Son; and that the Father is not glorified by

<p>That we must not speak foolishly and offensively. 1293</p>
<p>That faith is of advantage altogether, and that we can do as much as we believe. 1294</p>
<p>That he who believes can immediately obtain (i.e., pardon and peace). 1295</p>
<p>That believers who differ among themselves ought not to refer to a Gentile judge. 1296</p>
<p>That hope is of future things, and therefore that our faith concerning those things
which are promised ought to be patient.1297</p>
<p>That a woman ought to be silent in the church. 1298</p>
<p>That it arises from our fault and our desert that we suffer, and do not perceive God's
help in everything.1299</p>

<p>That even our enemies must be loved. 1301</p>
<p>That the sacrament of faith must not be profaned. 1302</p>
<p>That no one should be uplifted in his labour. 1303</p>
<p>That the liberty of believing or of not believing is placed in free choice. 1304</p>

to be simple.1305</p>

peace and the certainty of resurrection.1310</p>
<p>Of the idols which the Gentiles think to be gods. 1312</p>

<p>That marriage is not to be contracted with Gentiles. 1317</p>

which lead to life.1319</p>
<p>That all sins are put away in baptism. 1320</p>
<p>That the discipline of God is to be observed in Church precepts. 1321</p>
<p>That it was foretold that men should despise sound discipline. 1322</p>
<p>That we must depart from him who lives irregularly and contrary to discipline. 1323</p>
<p>That the kingdom of God is not in the wisdom of the world, nor in eloquence, but
in the faith of the cross, and in virtue of conversation.1324</p>
<p>That we must obey parents. 1325</p>
<p>And that fathers also should not be harsh in respect of their children. 1326</p>
<p>That servants, when they have believed, ought to serve their carnal masters the
better.1327</p>
<p>Moreover, that masters should be the more gentle. 1328</p>

<p>That a tuft of hair is not to be worn on the head. 1338</p>
<p>That the beard must not be plucked. 1339</p>
<p>That we must rise when a bishop or a presbyter comes. 1340</p>

in one faith, and in the same tradition.1341</p>

<p>That it was foretold that heresies would arise. 1348</p>
<p>That the Eucharist is to be received with fear and honour. 1349</p>
<p>That we are to live with the good, but to avoid the evil. 1350</p>
<p>That we must labour not with words, but with deeds. 1351</p>
<p>That we must hasten to faith and to attainment. 1352</p>

<p>A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity. 1462</p>
<p>Preface. 1462</p>
<p>Novatian, with the View of Treating of the Trinity, Sets Forth from the Rule of
Faith that We Should First of All Believe in God the Father and Lord
Omnipotent, the Absolute Founder of All Things. The Works of Creation are

<pb n="xxxi"/>
Beautifully Described. Man's Free-Will is Asserted; God's Mercy in Inflicting
Penalty on Man is Shown; The Condition After Death of the Souls of the
Righteous and Unrighteous is Determined.1463</p>
<p>God is Above All Things, Himself Containing All Things, Immense, Eternal,
Transcending the Mind of Man; Inexplicable in Discourse, Loftier Than All
Sublimity.1465</p>
<p>That God is the Founder of All Things, Their Lord and Parent, is Proved from
the Holy Scriptures.1467</p>
<p>Moreover, He is Good, Always the Same, Immutable, One and Only, Infinite;
And His Own Name Can Never Be Declared, and He is Incorruptible and
Immortal.1469</p>
<p>If We Regard the Anger, and Indignation, and Hatred of God Described in the
Sacred Pages, We Must Remember that They are Not to Be Understood as
Bearing the Character of Human Vices. 1471</p>
<p>And That, Although Scripture Often Changes the Divine Appearance into a
Human Form, Yet the Measure of the Divine Majesty is Not Included Within
These Lineaments of Our Bodily Nature.1472</p>
<p>Moreover, that When God is Called a Spirit, Brightness, and Light, God is Not
Sufficiently Expressed by Those Appellations.1474</p>
<p>It is This God, Therefore, that the Church Has Known and Adores; And to Him
the Testimony of Things as Well Visible as Invisible is Given Both at All Times
and in All Forms, by the Nature Which His Providence Rules and Governs.1475</p>
<p>Further, that the Same Rule of Truth Teaches Us to Believe, After the Father,
Also in the Son of God, Jesus Christ Our Lord God, Being the Same that Was
Promised in the Old Testament, and Manifested in the New.1478</p>
<p>That Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Truly Man, as Opposed to the Fancies
of Heretics, Who Deny that He Took Upon Him True Flesh.1480</p>
<p>And Indeed that Christ Was Not Only Man, But God Also; That Even as He
Was the Son of Man, So Also He Was the Son of God.1482</p>
<p>That Christ is God, is Proved by the Authority of the Old Testament Scriptures. 1484</p>
<p>That the Same Truth is Proved from the Sacred Writings of the New Covenant. 1486</p>
<p>The Author Prosecutes the Same Argument. 1488</p>
<p>Again He Proves from the Gospel that Christ is God. 1490</p>
<p>Again from the Gospel He Proves Christ to Be God. 1493</p>
<p>It Is, Moreover, Proved by Moses in the Beginning of the Holy Scriptures. 1496</p>

<pb n="xxxii"/>
<p>Moreover Also, from the Fact that He Who Was Seen of Abraham is Called
God; Which Cannot Be Understood of the Father, Whom No Man Hath Seen
at Any Time; But of the Son in the Likeness of an Angel.1498</p>
<p>That God Also Appeared to Jacob as an Angel; Namely, the Son of God. 1502</p>
<p>It is Proved from the Scriptures that Christ Was Called an Angel. But Yet It is
Shown from Other Parts of Holy Scripture that He is God Also.1505</p>
<p>That the Same Divine Majesty is Again Confirmed in Christ by Other Scriptures. 1507</p>
<p>That the Same Divine Majesty is in Christ, He Once More Asserts by Other
Scriptures.1510</p>
<p>And This is So Manifest, that Some Heretics Have Thought Him to Be God the
Father, Others that He Was Only God Without the Flesh.1512</p>
<p>That These Have Therefore Erred, by Thinking that There Was No Difference
Between the Son of God and the Son of Man; Because They Have Ill Understood
the Scripture.1513</p>
<p>And that It Does Not Follow Thence, that Because Christ Died It Must Also Be
Received that God Died; For Scripture Sets Forth that Not Only Was Christ
God, But Man Also. 1515</p>
<p>Moreover, Against the Sabellians He Proves that the Father is One, the Son 
Another.1517</p>
<p>He Skilfully Replies to a Passage Which the Heretics Employed in Defence of
Their Own Opinion.1519</p>
<p>He Proves Also that the Words Spoken to Philip Make Nothing for the Sabellians. 1521</p>
<p>He Next Teaches Us that the Authority of the Faith Enjoins, After the Father
and the Son, to Believe Also on the Holy Spirit, Whose Operations He
Enumerates from Scripture.1525</p>
<p>In Fine, Notwithstanding the Said Heretics Have Gathered the Origin of Their
Error from Consideration of What is Written: Although We Call Christ God,
and the Father God, Still Scripture Does Not Set Forth Two Gods, Any More
Than Two Lords or Two Teachers.1528</p>
<p>But that God, the Son of God, Born of God the Father from Everlasting, Who
Was Always in the Father, is the Second Person to the Father, Who Does Nothing
Without His Father's Decree; And that He is Lord, and the Angel of God's Great
Counsel, to Whom the Father's Godhead is Given by Community of Substance.1531</p>
<p>Two Notes by the American Editor. 1534</p>
<p>On the Jewish Meats. 1535</p>

<pb n="xxxiii"/>
<p>Novatian, a Roman Presbyter, During His Retirement at the Time of the Decian
Persecution, Being Urged by Various Letters from His Brethren, Had Written
Two Earlier Epistles Against the Jews on the Subjects of Circumcision and the
Sabbath, and Now Writes the Present One on the Jewish Meats.1535</p>
<p>He First of All Asserts that the Law is Spiritual; And Thence, Man's First Food
Was Only the Fruit Trees, and the Use of Flesh Was Added, that the Law that
Followed Subsequently Was to Be Understood Spiritually.1537</p>
<p>And Thus Unclean Animals are Not to Be Reproached, Lest the Reproach Be
Thrown Upon Their Author; But When an Irrational Animal is Rejected on
Any Account, It is Rather that that Very Thing Should Be Condemned in Man
Who is Rational; And Therefore that in Animals the Character, the Doings, and
the Wills of Men are Depicted.1540</p>
<p>To These Things Also Was Added Another Reason for Prohibiting Many Kinds
of Meats to the Jews; To Wit, for the Restraint of the Intemperance of the People,
and that They Might Serve the One God.1543</p>
<p>But There Was a Limit to the Use of These Shadows or Figures; For Afterwards,
When the End of the Law, Christ, Came, All Things Were Said by the Apostle
to Be Pure to the Pure, and the True and Holy Meat Was a Right Faith and an
Unspotted Conscience.1544</p>
<p>But, on the Ground that Liberty in Meats is Granted to Us, There is No
Permission of Luxury, There is No Taking Away of Continence and Fasting:
for These Things Greatly Become the Faithful,--To Wit, that They Should Pray
to God, and Give Him Thanks, Not Only by Day, But by Night.1546</p>
<p>Moreover, We Must Be Careful that No One Should Think that This Licence
May Be Carried to Such an Extent as that He May Approach to Things Offered
to Idols.1548</p>

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>This fifth volume will be found a work complete in itself, simplex et unum. At first, indeed,
it might look otherwise. The formation of Latin Christianity in the school of North
Africa seems interrupted by the interpolation, between Tertullian and his great pupil Cyprian,
of a Western bishop and doctor, who writes in Greek. A little reflection, however, will
suggest to the thoughtful student, that, even if our chronological plan admitted of it, we
should divest the works of Cyprian of a very great advantage should we deprive them of the
new and all-important light shed upon Cyprian and his conflicts with Stephen by the discovery
of the Philosophumena of Hippolytus. That discovery, as Dr. Bunsen reminds us, more
than once, has duplicated our information concerning the Western Church of the ante-
Nicene period. It gives us overwhelming evidence on many points heretofore imperfectly
understood, and confirms the surmises of the learned and candid authors who have endeavoured
to disentangle certain complications of history. It meets some questions of our own
day with most conclusive testimony, and probably had not a little to do with the ultimate
conclusions of Döllinger, and the rise of the Old Catholic school, among the Latins. We
cannot fail to observe in all this the hand of a wise and paternal Providence, which is never
wanting to the faithful in the day of trial. “I believe, with Niebuhr,” says Dr. Bunsen, “that
Providence always furnishes every generation with the necessary means of arriving at the
truth and at the solution of its doubts.” This consideration has inspired me with great hopes
from the publication of this series in America, where the aggressions of an alien element
are forcing us to renewed study of that virgin antiquity which is so fatal to its pretensions.
I can adopt with a grateful heart the language of Bunsen, when he adds:1 “I cannot help
thinking it of importance that we have just now so unexpectedly got our knowledge of facts
respecting early Christianity doubled.”</p>
<p>To show some tokens of this new light on old difficulties, I shall be obliged to throw
one or two of my Elucidations almost into the form of dissertations. It will appear, as we
proceed, that we have reached a most critical point in the ante-Nicene history, and one on
which that period itself depends for its complete exposition. Let me adduce conclusive
evidence of this by reference to two fundamental facts, which need only to be mentioned
to be admitted:—</p>
<p>1. The Council of Nice did not pretend to be setting forth a new creed, or making anything
doctrine which was not doctrine before. Hence the period we are now studying is to
be interpreted by the testimony of the Nicene Fathers, who were able to state historically,
and with great felicity, in idioms gradually framed by the Alexandrian theologians, the precise
<note type="footnote">1 Hippol., vol. i. p. 7. Ed. London, 1851.</note>

<pb n="4"/>
intent and purport of their teaching. The learned Bull has demonstrated this; demolishing
alike the sophistry of Petavius the Jesuit, and the efforts of latitudinarians to make capital
out of some of those obiter dicta of orthodox Fathers, which, like certain passages of Holy
Scripture itself, may be wrested into contradictory and self-stultifying declarations. Note,
therefore, that the Nicene Creed must be studied not so much in the controvertists of the
fourth century as in the doctors of preceding ages, whom we are reviewing in these pages.
vi</p>
<p>2. A like statement is true of the Nicene constitutions and discipline. The synodical rule,
alike in faith and discipline, was Τὰ ἄρχαῖα ἔθη κρατέιτο: “Let the (ancient) primitive examples
prevail.” Observe, therefore, what they ruled as to Rome and other churches was
already ancient. Now, the “duplicated” light thrown upon the position of the North-African
churches, and others in the West, at this period, by the discovery of long-lost portions of
Hippolytus, will be found to settle many groundless assertions of Roman controvertists as
to what these ἄρχαῖα ἔθη were.</p>
<p>Bearing this in mind, let us return to the point with which this Preface starts. We are
pausing for a moment, in the North-African history, to take a contemporary survey of Rome,
and to mark just where it stands, and what it is, at this moment. The earliest of the great
Roman Fathers now comes forward, but not as a Latin Father. He writes in Greek; he continues
the Greek line of thought brought into the West by Irenæus; he maintains the Johannean
rather than the Petrine traditions and idioms, which are distinct but not clashing; he
stands only in the third generation from St. John himself, through Polycarp, and his master
Irenæus; and, like his master, he confronts the Roman bishops of his time with a superior
orthodoxy and with an authority more apostolic.2 He illustrates in his own conduct the
maxim of Irenæus, that “the Catholic faith is preserved in Rome by the testimony imported
into it by those who visit it from every side;” that is, who thus keep alive in it the common
faith, as witnessed in all the churches of Christendom.</p>
<p>Thus, Hippolytus, once “torn to pieces as by horses,” in his works, if not in his person,
comes to life again in our times, to shed new light upon the history of Latin Christianity,
and to show that Rome had no place nor hand in its creation. He appears as a Greek Father
in a church which was yet a “Greek colony;”3 and he shows to what an estate of feebleness
and humiliation the Roman Church had been brought, probably by the neglect of preaching,
which is an anomaly in its history, and hardly less probably by its adherence to a Greek
liturgy long after the Christians of Rome had ceased to understand Greek familiarly. At such
a moment Hippolytus proves himself a reformer. His historical elucidations of the period,
therefore, form an admirable introduction to Cyprian, and will explain the entire independ-

ence of Roman dictation, with which he maintained his own opinions against that Church
and its bishops.</p>
<p>And lastly we have Novatian as a sequel to the works of Cyprian; and truly, the light
upon his sad history is “duplicated” by what Hippolytus shows us of the times and circumstances
which made his schism possible, and which somewhat relieve his character from its
darker shades.</p>
<p>Such, then, is the volume now given to the reader,—Hippolytus, Cyprian, Novatian,—affording
the fullest information ever yet brought together in one volume, upon the rise of
Latin Christianity, the decline of the Greek period of the Roman See, and the restricted
limits of the Roman province not yet elevated to the technical position of a Nicene patriarchate.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice to Hippolytus.</head>
<p>[a.d. 170–236.]</p>
<p>The first great Christian Father whose history is Roman is, nevertheless, not a Roman,
but a Greek. He is the disciple of Irenæus, and the spirit of his life-work rejects that of his
master. In his personal character he so much resembles Irenæus risen again,4 that the great
Bishop of Lyons must be well studied and understood if we would do full justice to the
conduct of Hippolytus. Especially did he follow his master’s example in withstanding contemporary
bishops of Rome, who, like Victor, “deserved to be blamed,” but who, much
more than any of their predecessors, merited rebuke alike for error in doctrine and viciousness
of life.</p>
<p>In the year 1551, while some excavations were in progress near the ancient Church of
St. Lawrence at Rome, on the Tiburtine Road, there was found an ancient statue, in marble,
of a figure seated in a chair, and wearing over the Roman tunic the pallium of Tertullian’s
eulogy. It was in 1851, just three hundred years after its discovery, and in the year of the
publication of the newly discovered Philosophumena at Oxford, that I saw it in the Vatican.
As a specimen of early Christian art it is a most interesting work, and possesses a higher
merit than almost any similar production of a period subsequent to that of the Antonines.5
It represents a grave personage, of noble features and a high, commanding forehead, slightly
bearded, his right hand resting over his heart, while under it his left arm crosses the body
to reach a book placed at his side. There is no reason to doubt that this is, indeed, the statue
of Hippolytus, as is stated in the inscription of Pius IV., who calls him “Saint Hippolytus,
Bishop of Portus,” and states that he lived in the reign of the Emperor Alexander; i.e.,
Severus.</p>
<p>Of this there is evidence on the chair itself, which represents his episcopal cathedra, and
has a modest symbol of lions at “the stays,” as if borrowed from the throne of Solomon. It
is a work of later date than the age of Severus, no doubt; but Wordsworth, who admirably
illustrates the means by which such a statue may have been provided, gives us good reasons
for supposing that it may have been the grateful tribute of contemporaries, and all the more
trustworthy as a portrait of the man himself. The chair has carved upon it, no doubt for
use in the Church, a calendar indicating the Paschal full moons for seven cycles of sixteen
years each; answering, according to the science of the period, to similar tables in the

Anglican Book of Common Prayer. It indicates the days on which Easter must fall, from
a.d. 222 to a.d. 333. On the back of the chair is a list of the author’s works.6</p>
<p>Not less interesting, and vastly more important, was the discovery, at Mount Athos, in
1842, of the long-lost Philosophumena of this author, concerning which the important facts
will appear below. Its learned editor, Emmanuel Miller, published it at Oxford under the
name of Origen, which was inscribed on the ms. Like the Epistle of Clement, its composition
in the Greek language had given it currency among the Easterns long after it was forgotten
in the West; and very naturally they had ascribed to Origen an anonymous treatise containing
much in coincidence with his teachings, and supplying the place of one of his works of a
similar kind. It is now sufficiently established as the work of Hippolytus, and has been
providentially brought to light just when it was most needed.7 In fact, the statue rose from
its grave as if to rebuke the reigning pontiff (Pius IV.), who just then imposed upon the
Latin churches the novel “Creed” which bears his name; and now the Philosophumena comes
forth as if to breathe a last warning to that namesake of the former Pius who, in the very
teeth of its testimony, so recently forged and uttered the dogma of “papal infallibility” conferring
this attribute upon himself, and retrospectively upon the very bishops of Rome whom
St. Hippolytus resisted as heretics, and has transmitted to posterity, in his writings, branded
with the shame alike of false doctrine and of heinous crimes. Dr. Döllinger, who for a time
lent his learning and genius to an apologetic effort in behalf of the Papacy, was no doubt
prepared, by this very struggle of his heart versus head, for that rejection of the new dogma
which overloaded alike his intellect and his conscience, and made it impossible for him any
longer to bear the lashes of Rehoboam8 in communion with modern Rome.</p>
<p>In the biographical data which will be found below, enough is supplied for the needs
of the reader of the present series, who, if he wishes further to investigate the subject, will
find the fullest information in the works to which reference has been made, or which will
be hereafter indicated.9 But this is the place to recur to the much-abused passage of Irenæus
which I have discussed in a former volume.10 Strange to say, I was forced to correct, from
a Roman-Catholic writer, the very unsatisfactory rendering of our Edinburgh editors, and
to elucidate at some length the palpable absurdity of attributing to Irenæus any other than

a geographical and imperial reference to the importance of Rome, and its usefulness to the
West, more especially, as its only see of apostolic origin. Quoting the Ninth Antiochian
Canon, I gave good reasons for my conjecture that the Latin convenire represents συντρέχειν
in the original; and now it remains to be noted how strongly the real meaning of Irenæus
is illustrated in the life and services of his pupil Hippolytus.</p>
<p>1. That neither Hippolytus nor his master had any conception that the See of Rome
possesses any pre-eminent authority, to which others are obliged to defer, is conspicuously
evident from the history of both. Alike they convicted Roman bishops of error, and alike
they rebuked them for their misconduct.</p>
<p>2. Hippolytus is the author of a work called the Little Labyrinth, which, like the recently
discovered Philosophumena, attributes to the Roman See anything but the “infallibility”
which the quotation from Irenæus is so ingeniously wrested to sustain.11 How he did not
understand the passage is, therefore, sufficiently apparent. Let us next inquire what appears,
from his conduct, to be the true understanding of Irenæus.</p>
<p>3. I have shown, in the elucidation already referred to, how Irenæus affirms that Rome
is the city which everybody visits from all parts, and that Christians, resorting thither, because
it is the Imperial City, carry into it the testimony of all other churches. Thus it becomes a
competent witness to the quod ab omnibus, because it cannot be ignorant of what all the
churches teach with one accord. This argument, therefore, reverses the modern Roman
dogma; primitive Rome received orthodoxy instead of prescribing it. She embosomed the
Catholic testimony brought into it from all the churches, and gave it forth as reflected light;
not primarily her own, but what she faithfully preserved in coincidence with older and more
learned churches than herself. Doubtless she had been planted and watered by St. Paul and
St. Peter; but doubtless, also, she had been expressly warned by the former of her liability
to error and to final severance12 from apostolic communion. Hippolytus lived at a critical
moment, when this awful admonition seemed about to be realized.</p>
<p>4. Now, then, from Portus and from Lyons, Hippolytus brought into Rome the Catholic
doctrine, and convicted two of its bishops of pernicious heresies and evil living. And thus,
as Irenæus teaches, the faith was preserved in Rome by the testimony of those from every
side resorting thither, not by any prerogative of the See itself. All this will appear clearly
enough as the student proceeds in the examination of this volume. But it is now time to
avail ourselves of the information given us by the translator in his Introductory Notice, as
follows:—</p>
<p>The entire of The Refutation of all Heresies, with the exception of book i., was found in
a ms. brought from a convent on Mount Athos so recently as the year 1842. The discoverer

of this treasure—for treasure it certainly is—was Minöides Mynas, an erudite Greek, who
had visited his native country in search of ancient mss., by direction of M. Abel Villemain,
Minister of Public Instruction under Louis Philippe. The French Government have thus
the credit of being instrumental in bringing to light this valuable work, while the University
of Oxford shares the distinction by being its earliest publishers. The Refutation was printed
at the Clarendon Press in 1851, under the editorship of M. Emmanuel Miller,13 whose labours
have proved serviceable to all subsequent commentators. One generally acknowledged
mistake was committed by Miller in ascribing the work to Origen. He was right in affirming
that the discovered ms. was the continuation of the fragment, The Philosophumena, inserted
in the Benedictine copy of Origen’s works. In the volume, however, containing the Philosophumena,
we have dissertations by Huet, in which he questions Origen’s authorship in
favour of Epiphanius. Heuman attributed the Philosophumena to Didymus of Alexandria,
Gale to Aetius;14 and it, with the rest of The Refutation, Fessler and Baur ascribed to Caius,
but the Abbe Jellabert to Tertullian. The last hypothesis is untenable, if for no other reason,
because the work is in Greek. In many respects, Caius, who was a presbyter of Rome in the
time of Victor and Zephyrinus, would seem the probable author; but a fatal argument—one
applicable to those named above, except Epiphanius—against Caius is his not being, as the
author of The Refutation in the Prooemium declares himself to be, a bishop. Epiphanius no
doubt filled the episcopal office; but when we have a large work of his on the heresies, with
a summary,15 it would seem scarcely probable that he composed likewise, on the same
topic, an extended treatise like the present, with two abridgments. Whatever diversity of
opinion, however, existed as to these claimants, most critics, though not all, now agree in
denying the authorship of Origen. Neither the style nor tone of The Refutation is Origenian.
Its compilatory process is foreign to Origen’s plan of composition; while the subject matter
itself, for many reasons, would not be likely to have occupied the pen of the Alexandrine
Father. It is almost impossible but that Origen would have made some allusions in The Refutation
to his other writings, or in them to it. Not only, however, is there no such allusion,
but the derivation of the word “Ebionites,” in The Refutation, and an expressed belief in the
(orthodox) doctrine of eternal punishment, are at variance with Origen’s authorship. Again,
no work answering the description is awarded to Origen in catalogues of his extant or lost
writings. These arguments are strengthened by the facts, that Origen was never a bishop,
and that he did not reside for any length of time at Rome. He once paid a hurried visit to
the capital of the West, whereas the author of The Refutation asserts his presence at Rome

during the occurrence of events which occupied a period of some twenty years. And not
only was he a spectator, but took part in these transactions in such an official and authoritative
manner as Origen could never have assumed, either at Rome or elsewhere.</p>
<p>In this state of the controversy, commentators turned their attention towards Hippolytus,
in favour of whose authorship the majority of modern scholars have decided. The arguments
that have led to this conclusion, and those alleged by others against it, could not be adequately
discussed in a notice like the present. Suffice it to say, that such names as Jacobi, Gieseler,
Duncker, Schneidewin, Bernays, Bunsen, Wordsworth, and Döllinger, support the claims
of Hippolytus. The testimony of Dr. Döllinger, considering the extent of his theological
learning, and in particular his intimate acquaintance with the apostolic period in church
history, virtually, we submit, decides the question.16</p>
<p>For a biography of Hippolytus we have not much authentic materials. There can be no
reasonable doubt but that he was a bishop, and passed the greater portion of his life in Rome
and its vicinity. This assertion corresponds with the conclusion adopted by Dr. Döllinger,
who, however, refuses to allow that Hippolytus was, as is generally maintained, Bishop of
Portus, a harbour of Rome at the northern mouth of the Tiber, opposite Ostia. However,
it is satisfactory to establish, and especially upon such eminent authority as that of Dr.
Döllinger, the fact of Hippolytus’ connection with the Western Church, not only because
it bears on the investigation of the authorship of The Refutation, the writer of which affirms
his personal observation of what he records as occurring in his own time at Rome, but also
because it overthrows the hypothesis of those who contend that there were more Hippolytuses
than one—Dr. Döllinger shows that there is only one historical Hippolytus—or that the
East, and not Italy, was the sphere of his episcopal labours. Thus Le Moyne, in the seventeenth
century, a French writer resident in Leyden, ingeniously argues that Hippolytus was bishop
of Portus Romanorum (Aden), in Arabia. Le Moyne’s theory was adopted by some
celebrities, viz., Dupin, Tillemont, Spanheim, Basnage, and our own Dr. Cave. To this position
are opposed, among others, the names of Nicephorus, Syncellus, Baronius, Bellarmine,
Dodwell, Beveridge, Bull, and Archbishop Ussher. The judgment and critical accuracy of
Ussher is, on a point of this kind, of the highest value. Wherefore the question of Hippolytus
being bishop of Portus near Rome would also appear established, for the reasons laid down
<note type="footnote">16 Those who are desirous of examining it for themselves may consult Gieseler’s paper on Hippolytus, etc.,

in Bunsen’s Letters to Archdeacon Hare, and Canon Wordsworth’s St. Hippolytus. The mind
of inquirers appears to have been primarily unsettled in consequence of Eusebius’ mentioning
Hippolytus (Ecclesiast. Hist., vi. 10) in company with Beryllus (of Bostra), an Arabian, expressing
at the same time his uncertainty as to where Hippolytus was bishop. This indecision
is easily explained, and cannot invalidate the tradition and historical testimony which assign
the bishopric of Portus near Rome to Hippolytus, a saint and martyr of the Church. Of his
martyrdom, though the fact itself is certain, the details, furnished in Prudentius’ hymn, are
not historic. Thus the mode of Hippolytus’ death is stated by Prudentius to have been
identical with that of Hippolytus the son of Theseus, who was torn limb from limb by being
tied to wild horses. St. Hippolytus, however, is known on historical testimony to have been
thrown into a canal and drowned; but whether the scene of his martyrdom was Sardinia, to
which he was undoubtedly banished along with the Roman bishop Pontianus, or Rome, or
Portus, has not as yet been definitively proved. The time of his martyrdom, however, is
probably a year or two, perhaps less or more, after the commencement of the reign of
Maximin the Thracian, that is, somewhere about a.d. 235–39. This enables us to determine
the age of Hippolytus; and as some statements in The Refutation evince the work to be the
composition of an old man, and as the work itself was written after the death of Callistus in
a.d. 222, this would transfer the period of his birth to not very long after the last half of the
second century.</p>
<p>The contents of The Refutation, as they originally stood, seem to have been arranged
thus: The first book (which we have) contained an account of the different schools of ancient
philosophers; the second (which is missing), the doctrines and mysteries of the Egyptians;
the third (likewise missing), the Chaldean science and astrology; and the fourth (the beginning
of which is missing), the system of the Chaldean horoscope, and the magical rites and
incantations of the Babylonian Theurgists. Next came the portion of the work relating more
immediately to the heresies of the Church, which is contained in books v.–ix. The tenth
book is the résumé of the entire, together with the exposition of the author’s own religious
opinions. The heresies enumerated by Hippolytus comprehend a period starting from an
age prior to the composition of St. John’s Gospel, and terminating with the death of Callistus.
The heresies are explained according to chronological development, and may be ranged
under five leading schools: (1) The Ophites; (2) Simonists; (3) Basilidians; (4) Docetæ; (5)
Noetians. Hippolytus ascends to the origin of heresy, not only in assigning heterodoxy a
derivative nature from heathenism, but in pointing out in the Gnosis elements of abnormal
opinions antecedent to the promulgation of Christianity. We have thus a most interesting
account of the early heresies, which in some respects supplies many desiderata in the ecclesiastical
history of this epoch.</p>
<p>We can scarcely over-estimate the value of The Refutation, on account of the propinquity
of its author to the apostolic age. Hippolytus was a disciple of St. Irenæus, St. Irenæus of St.

<pb n="13"/>
Polycarp, St. Polycarp of St. John. Indeed, one fact of grave importance connected with the
writings of St. John, is elicited from Hippolytus’ Refutation. The passage given out of Basilides’
work, containing a quotation by the heretic from St. John i. 9, settles the period of the
composition of the fourth Gospel, as of greater antiquity by at least thirty years than is allowed
to it by the Tübingen school. It is therefore obvious that Basilides formed his system out of
the prologue of St. John’s Gospel; thus for ever setting at rest the allegation of these critics,
that St. John’s Gospel was written at a later date, and assigned an apostolic author, in order
to silence the Basilidian Gnostics.17 In the case of Irenæus, too, The Refutation has restored
the Greek text of much of his book Against Heresies, hitherto only known to us in a Latin
version. Nor is the value of Hippolytus’ work seriously impaired, even on the supposition
of the authorship not being proved,—a concession, however, in no wise justified by the
evidence. Whoever the writer of The Refutation be, he belonged to the early portion of the
third century, formed his compilations from primitive sources, made conscientious preparation
for his undertaking, delivered statements confirmed by early writers of note,18 and
lastly, in the execution of his task, furnished indubitable marks of information and research,
and of having thoroughly mastered the relations and affinities, each to other, of the various
heresies of the first two and a quarter centuries. These heresies, whether deducible from
attempts to Christianize the philosophy of Paganism, or to interpret the Doctrines and Life
of our Lord by the tenets of Gnosticism and Oriental speculation generally, or to create a
compromise with the pretensions of Judaism,—these heresies, amid all their complexity
and diversity, St. Hippolytus19 reduces to one common ground of censure—antagonism to
<note type="footnote">17 It settles the period of the composition of St. John’s Gospel only, of course, on the supposition that Hippolytus
is giving a correct account as regards Basilides’ work. The mode, however, in which Hippolytus introduces
the quotation, appears to place its authenticity beyond reasonable doubt. He represents Basilides (see book vii.
chap. 10) as notifying his reference to St. John’s Gospel thus, “And this,” he says, “is what has been stated in the
Gospels: ‘He was the true light, which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world.’” Now this is precisely
the mode of reference we should expect that Basilides would employ; whereas, if Hippolytus had either fabricated
the passage or adduced it from hearsay, it is almost certain he would have said “in the Gospel of St. John,” and
not indefinitely “the Gospels.” And more than this, the formulary “in the Gospels,” adopted by Basilides, reads
very like a recognition of an agreed collection of authorized accounts of our Lord’s life and sayings. It is also
remarkable that the word “stated” (λεγόμενον) Basilides has just used in quoting (Gen. i. 3) as interchangeable
with “written” (γέγραπται), the word exclusively applied to what is included within the canon of Scripture.</note>

Origen of all Heresies;” 2. “Of Origen’s Philosophumena…these are the contents;” 3. “Being estimable (Dissertations)
by Origen, a man of the greatest wisdom.” The recently discovered ms. itself in the margin has the
words, “Origen, and Origen’s opinion.” The title, as agreed upon by modern commentators, is: 1. “Book I. of
Origen’s Refutation of all Heresies” (Wolf and Gronovius); 2. “A Refutation of all Heresies;” 3. “Origen’s
Philosophumena, or the Refutation of all Heresies.” The last is Miller’s in his Oxford edition, 1851. The title
might have been, “Philosophumena, and the Refutation (therefrom) of all Heresies.” There were obviously two
divisions of the work: (1) A résumé of the tenets of the philosophers (books i., ii., iii., iv.), preparatory to (2) the
refutation of heresies, on the ground of their derivative character from Greek and Egyptian speculation. Bunsen
would denominate the work “St. Hippolytus’ (Bishop and Martyr) Refutation of all Heresies; what remains of
the ten books.”</note>

the Stoic (logicians) were Chrysippus (and) Zeno. Epicurus, however, advanced an opinion
almost contrary to all philosophers. Pyrrho was an Academic;22 this (speculator) taught the

<p>The Prooemium.—Motives for Undertaking the Refutation; Exposure of the Ancient
Mysteries; Plan of the Work; Completeness of the Refutation; Value of the
Treatise to Future Ages.</p>
<p>We must not overlook23 any figment devised by those denominated philosophers among
the Greeks. For even their incoherent tenets must be received as worthy of credit, on account
of the excessive madness of the heretics; who, from the observance of silence, and from
concealing their own ineffable mysteries, have by many been supposed worshippers of
God.24 We have likewise, on a former occasion,25 expounded the doctrines of these briefly,
not illustrating them with any degree of minuteness, but refuting them in coarse digest; not
having considered it requisite to bring to light their secret26 doctrines, in order that, when
we have explained their tenets by enigmas, they, becoming ashamed, lest also, by our divulging
their mysteries, we should convict them of atheism, might be induced to desist in some
degree from their unreasonable opinion and their profane attempt.27 But since I perceive
that they have not been abashed by our forbearance, and have made no account of how God
is long-suffering, though blasphemed by them, in order that either from shame they may
repent, or should they persevere, be justly condemned, I am forced to proceed in my intention
of exposing those secret mysteries of theirs, which, to the initiated, with a vast amount of
plausibility they deliver who are not accustomed first to disclose (to any one), till, by keeping
such in suspense during a period (of necessary preparation), and by rendering him blasphemous
towards the true God they have acquired complete ascendancy over him, and perceive
him eagerly panting after the promised disclosure. And then, when they have tested him to
be enslaved by sin, they initiate him, putting him in possession of the perfection of wicked
things. Previously, however, they bind him with an oath neither to divulge (the mysteries),
nor to hold communication with any person whatsoever, unless he first undergo similar
subjection, though, when the doctrine has been simply delivered (to any one), there was no
longer any need of an oath. For he who was content to submit to the necessary purgation,28
and so receive the perfect mysteries of these men, by the very act itself, as well as in reference

to his own conscience, will feel himself sufficiently under an obligation not to divulge to
others; for if he once disclose wickedness of this description to any man, he would neither
be reckoned among men, nor be deemed worthy to behold the light, since not even irrational
animals29 would attempt such an enormity, as we shall explain when we come to treat of
such topics.</p>
<p>Since, however, reason compels us to plunge30 into the very depth of narrative, we
conceive we should not be silent, but, expounding the tenets of the several schools with
minuteness, we shall evince reserve in nothing. Now it seems expedient, even at the expense
of a more protracted investigation, not to shrink from labour; for we shall leave behind us
no trifling auxiliary to human life against the recurrence of error, when all are made to behold,
in an obvious light, the clandestine rites of these men, and the secret orgies which, retaining
under their management, they deliver to the initiated only. But none will refute these, save
the Holy Spirit bequeathed unto the Church, which the Apostles, having in the first instance
received, have transmitted to those who have rightly believed. But we, as being their successors,
and as participators in this grace, high-priesthood, and office of teaching,31 as well
as being reputed guardians of the Church, must not be found deficient in vigilance,32 or
disposed to suppress correct doctrine.33 Not even, however, labouring with every energy of
body and soul, do we tire in our attempt adequately to render our Divine Benefactor a fitting
return; and yet withal we do not so requite Him in a becoming manner, except we are not
remiss in discharging the trust committed to us, but careful to complete the measure of our
particular opportunity, and to impart to all without grudging whatever the Holy Ghost
supplies, not only bringing to light,34 by means of our refutation, matters foreign (to our
subject), but also whatsoever things the truth has received by the grace of the Father,35 and

ministered to men. These also, illustrating by argument and creating testimony36 by letters,
we shall unabashed proclaim.</p>
<p>In order, then, as we have already stated, that we may prove them atheists, both in
opinion and their mode (of treating a question) and in fact, and (in order to show) whence
it is that their attempted theories have accrued unto them, and that they have endeavoured
to establish their tenets, taking nothing from the holy Scriptures—nor is it from preserving
the succession of any saint that they have hurried headlong into these opinions;—but that
their doctrines have derived their origin37 from the wisdom of the Greeks, from the conclusions
of those who have formed systems of philosophy, and from would-be mysteries, and
the vagaries of astrologers,—it seems, then, advisable, in the first instance, by explaining
the opinions advanced by the philosophers of the Greeks, to satisfy our readers that such
are of greater antiquity than these (heresies), and more deserving of reverence in reference
to their views respecting the divinity; in the next place, to compare each heresy with the
system of each speculator, so as to show that the earliest champion of the heresy availing
himself38 of these attempted theories, has turned them to advantage by appropriating their
principles, and, impelled from these into worse, has constructed his own doctrine. The un-
dertaking admittedly is full of labour, and (is one) requiring extended research. We shall
not, however, be wanting in exertion; for afterwards it will be a source of joy, just like an
athlete obtaining with much toil the crown, or a merchant after a huge swell of sea compassing
gain, or a husbandman after sweat of brow enjoying the fruits, or a prophet after
reproaches and insults seeing his predictions turning out true. In the commencement,
therefore, we shall declare who first, among the Greeks, pointed out (the principles of) natural
philosophy. For from these especially have they furtively taken their views who have
first propounded these heresies,39 as we shall subsequently prove when we come to compare
them one with another. Assigning to each of those who take the lead among philosophers
their own peculiar tenets, we shall publicly exhibit these heresiarchs as naked and unseemly.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Thales; His Physics and Theology; Founder of Greek Astronomy.</head>
<p>It is said that Thales of Miletus, one of the seven40 wise men, first attempted to frame
a system of natural philosophy. This person said that some such thing as water is the generative
principle of the universe, and its end;—for that out of this, solidified and again dissolved,
all things consist, and that all things are supported on it; from which also arise both earthquakes
and changes of the winds and atmospheric movements,41 and that all things are
both produced42 and are in a state of flux corresponding with the nature of the primary
author of generation;—and that the Deity43 is that which has neither beginning nor end.
This person, having been occupied with an hypothesis and investigation concerning the
stars, became the earliest author to the Greeks of this kind of learning. And he, looking towards
heaven, alleging that he was carefully examining supernal objects, fell into a well; and
a certain maid, by name Thratta, remarked of him derisively, that while intent on beholding
things in heaven, he did not know44 what was at his feet. And he lived about the time of
Croesus.</p>

Physiognomy; His Philosophy of Numbers; His System of the Transmigration
of Souls; Zaratas on Demons; Why Pythagoras Forbade the Eating of Beans; The
Mode of Living Adopted by His Disciples.</head>
<p>But there was also, not far from these times, another philosophy which Pythagoras originated
(who some say was a native of Samos), which they have denominated Italian, because
that Pythagoras, flying from Polycrates the king of Samos, took up his residence in a city of
Italy, and there passed the entire of his remaining years. And they who received in succession
his doctrine, did not much differ from the same opinion. And this person, instituting an
investigation concerning natural phenomena,45 combined together astronomy, and geometry,
and music.46 And so he proclaimed that the Deity is a monad; and carefully acquainting
himself with the nature of number, he affirmed that the world sings, and that its system
corresponds with harmony, and he first resolved the motion of the seven stars into rhythm
and melody. And being astonished at the management of the entire fabric, he required that
at first his disciples should keep silence, as if persons coming into the world initiated in (the
secrets of) the universe; next, when it seemed that they were sufficiently conversant with
his mode of teaching his doctrine, and could forcibly philosophize concerning the stars and
nature, then, considering them pure, he enjoins them to speak. This man distributed his
pupils in two orders, and called the one esoteric, but the other exoteric. And to the former
he confided more advanced doctrines, and to the latter a more moderate amount of instruction.</p>
<p>And he also touched on magic—as they say—and himself47 discovered an art of
physiogony,48 laying down as a basis certain numbers and measures, saying that they comprised
the principle of arithmetical philosophy by composition after this manner. The first
number became an originating principle, which is one, indefinable, incomprehensible,
having in itself all numbers that, according to plurality, can go on ad infinitum. But the
primary monad became a principle of numbers, according to substance,49—which is a male
monad, begetting after the manner of a parent all the rest of the numbers. Secondly, the
duad is a female number, and the same also is by arithmeticians termed even. Thirdly, the

triad is a male number. This also has been classified by arithmeticians under the denomination
uneven. And in addition to all these is the tetrad, a female number; and the same also
is called even, because it is female. Therefore all the numbers that have been derived from
the genus are four; but number is the indefinite genus, from which was constituted, according
to them, the perfect50 number, viz., the decade. For one, two, three, four, become ten, if its
proper denomination be preserved essentially for each of the numbers. Pythagoras affirmed
this to be a sacred quaternion, source of everlasting nature,51 having, as it were, roots in itself;
and that from this number all the numbers receive their originating principle. For eleven,
and twelve, and the rest, partake of the origin of existence52 from ten. Of this decade, the
perfect number, there are termed four divisions,—namely, number, monad,53 square, (and)
cube. And the connections and blendings of these are performed, according to nature, for
the generation of growth completing the productive number. For when the square itself is
multiplied54 into itself, a biquadratic is the result. But when the square is multiplied into
the cube, the result is the product of a square and cube; and when the cube is multiplied
into the cube, the product of two cubes is the result. So that all the numbers from which the
production of existing (numbers) arises, are seven,—namely, number, monad, square, cube,
biquadratic, quadratic-cube, cubo-cube.</p>
<p>This philosopher likewise said that the soul is immortal, and that it subsists in successive
bodies. Wherefore he asserted that before the Trojan era he was Æthalides,55 and during
the Trojan epoch Euphorbus, and subsequent to this Hermotimus of Samos, and after him

Pyrrhus of Delos; fifth, Pythagoras. And Diodorus the Eretrian,56 and Aristoxenus57 the
musician, assert that Pythagoras came to Zaratas58 the Chaldean, and that he explained to
him that there are two original causes of things, father and mother, and that father is light,
but mother darkness; and that of the light the parts are hot, dry, not heavy, light, swift; but
of darkness, cold, moist, weighty, slow; and that out of all these, from female and male, the
world consists. But the world, he says, is a musical harmony;59 wherefore, also, that the sun
performs a circuit in accordance with harmony. And as regards the things that are produced
from earth and the cosmical system, they maintain that Zaratas60 makes the following
statements: that there are two demons, the one celestial and the other terrestrial; and that
the terrestrial sends up a production from earth, and that this is water; and that the celestial
is a fire, partaking of the nature of air, hot and cold.61 And he therefore affirms that none
of these destroys or sullies the soul, for these constitute the substance of all things. And he
is reported to have ordered his followers not to eat beans, because that Zaratas said that, at
the origin and concretion of all things, when the earth was still undergoing its process of

solidification,62 and that of putrefaction had set in, the bean was produced.63 And of this
he mentions the following indication, that if any one, after having chewed a bean without
the husk, places it opposite the sun for a certain period,—for this immediately will aid in
the result,—it yields the smell of human seed. And he mentions also another clearer instance
to be this: if, when the bean is blossoming, we take the bean and its flower, and deposit them
in a jar, smear this over, and bury it in the ground, and after a few days uncover it, we shall
see it wearing the appearance, first of a woman’s pudendum, and after this, when closely
examined, of the head of a child growing in along with it. This person, being burned along
with his disciples in Croton, a town of Italy, perished. And this was a habit with him,
whenever one repaired to him with a view of becoming his follower, (the candidate disciple
was compelled) to sell his possessions, and lodge the money sealed with Pythagoras, and he
continued in silence to undergo instruction, sometimes for three, but sometimes for five
years. And again, on being released, he was permitted to associate with the rest, and remained
as a disciple, and took his meals along with them; if otherwise, however, he received back
his property, and was rejected. These persons, then, were styled Esoteric Pythagoreans,
whereas the rest, Pythagoristæ.</p>
<p>Among his followers, however, who escaped the conflagration were Lysis and Archippus,
and the servant of Pythagoras, Zamolxis,64 who also is said to have taught the Celtic Druids
to cultivate the philosophy of Pythagoras. And they assert that Pythagoras learned from the
Egyptians his system of numbers and measures; and being struck by the plausible, fanciful,
and not easily revealed wisdom of the priests, he himself likewise, in imitation of them, enjoined
silence, and made his disciples lead a solitary life in underground chapels.65</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Empedocles; His Twofold Cause; Tenet of Transmigration.</head>
<p>But Empedocles, born after these, advanced likewise many statements respecting the
nature of demons, to the effect that, being very numerous, they pass their time in managing
earthly concerns. This person affirmed the originating principle of the universe to be discord
and friendship, and that the intelligible fire of the monad is the Deity, and that all things
consist of fire, and will be resolved into fire; with which opinion the Stoics likewise almost
agree, expecting a conflagration. But most of all does he concur with the tenet of transition
of souls from body to body, expressing himself thus:—
<lg>
<l>“For surely both youth and maid I was,</l>
<l>And shrub, and bird,66 and fish, from ocean stray’d.”67</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>This (philosopher) maintained the transmutation of all souls into any description of
animal. For Pythagoras, the instructor of these (sages),68 asserted that himself had been
Euphorbus, who served in the expedition against Ilium, alleging that he recognised his

<p>But Heraclitus, a natural philosopher of Ephesus, surrendered himself to universal grief,
condemning the ignorance of the entire of life, and of all men; nay, commiserating the (very)
existence of mortals, for he asserted that he himself knew everything, whereas the rest of
mankind nothing.69 But he also advanced statements almost in concert with Empedocles,
saying that the originating principle of all things is discord and friendship, and that the
Deity is a fire endued with intelligence, and that all things are borne one upon another, and
never are at a standstill; and just as Empedocles, he affirmed that the entire locality about
us is full of evil things, and that these evil things reach as far as the moon, being extended
from the quarter situated around the earth, and that they do not advance further, inasmuch
as the entire space above the moon is more pure. So also it seemed to Heraclitus.</p>
<p>After these arose also other natural philosophers, whose opinions we have not deemed
it necessary to declare, (inasmuch as) they present no diversity to those already specified.
Since, however, upon the whole, a not inconsiderable school has sprung (from thence), and
many natural philosophers subsequently have arisen from them, each advancing different
accounts of the nature of the universe, it seems also to us advisable, that, explaining the
philosophy that has come down by succession from Pythagoras, we should recur to the
opinions entertained by those living after the time of Thales, and that, furnishing a narrative
of these, we should approach the consideration of the ethical and logical philosophy which
Socrates and Aristotle originated, the former ethical, and the latter logical.70</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Anaximander; His Theory of the Infinite; His Astronomic Opinions;
His Physics.</head>
<p>Anaximander, then, was the hearer of Thales. Anaximander was son of Praxiadas, and
a native of Miletus. This man said that the originating principle of existing things is a certain
constitution of the Infinite, out of which the heavens are generated, and the worlds therein;
and that this principle is eternal and undecaying, and comprising all the worlds. And he
speaks of time as something of limited generation, and subsistence, and destruction. This
person declared the Infinite to be an originating principle and element of existing things,
being the first to employ such a denomination of the originating principle. But, moreover,
he asserted that there is an eternal motion, by the agency of which it happens that the
heavens71 are generated; but that the earth is poised aloft, upheld by nothing, continuing
(so) on account of its equal distance from all (the heavenly bodies); and that the figure of it
is curved, circular,72 similar to a column of stone.73 And one of the surfaces we tread upon,
but the other is opposite.74 And that the stars are a circle of fire, separated from the fire
which is in the vicinity of the world, and encompassed by air. And that certain atmospheric
exhalations arise in places where the stars shine; wherefore, also, when these exhalations
are obstructed, that eclipses take place. And that the moon sometimes appears full and
sometimes waning, according to the obstruction or opening of its (orbital) paths. But that
the circle of the sun is twenty-seven times75 larger than the moon, and that the sun is situated
in the highest (quarter of the firmament); whereas the orbs of the fixed stars in the lowest.
And that animals are produced (in moisture76) by evaporation from the sun. And that man
was, originally, similar to a different animal, that is, a fish. And that winds are caused by
the separation of very rarified exhalations of the atmosphere, and by their motion after they
have been condensed. And that rain arises from earth’s giving back (the vapours which it
receives) from the (clouds77) under the sun. And that there are flashes of lightning when
the wind coming down severs the clouds. This person was born in the third year of the xlii.

<head>Chapter VI.—Anaximenes; His System of “An Infinite Air;” His Views of Astronomy
and Natural Phenomena.</head>
<p>But Anaximenes, who himself was also a native of Miletus, and son of Eurystratus, affirmed
that the originating principle is infinite air, out of which are generated things existing,
those which have existed, and those that will be, as well as gods and divine (entities), and
that the rest arise from the offspring of this. But that there is such a species of air, when it
is most even, which is imperceptible to vision, but capable of being manifested by cold and
heat, and moisture and motion, and that it is continually in motion; for that whatsoever
things undergo alteration, do not change if there is not motion. For that it presents a different
appearance according as it is condensed and attenuated, for when it is dissolved into what
is more attenuated that fire is produced, and that when it is moderately condensed again
into air that a cloud is formed from the air by virtue of the contraction;79 but when condensed
still more, water, (and) that when the condensation is carried still further, earth is formed;
and when condensed to the very highest degree, stones. Wherefore, that the dominant
principles of generation are contraries,—namely, heat and cold. And that the expanded
earth is wafted along upon the air, and in like manner both sun and moon and the rest of
the stars; for all things being of the nature of fire, are wafted about through the expanse of
space, upon the air. And that the stars are produced from earth by reason of the mist which
arises from this earth; and when this is attenuated, that fire is produced, and that the stars
consist of the fire which is being borne aloft. But also that there are terrestrial natures in the
region of the stars carried on along with them. And he says that the stars do not move under
the earth, as some have supposed, but around the earth,80 just as a cap is turned round our
head; and that the sun is hid, not by being under the earth, but because covered by the
higher portions of the earth, and on account of the greater distance that he is from us. But
that the stars do not emit heat on account of the length of distance; and that the winds are
produced when the condensed air, becoming rarified, is borne on; and that when collected
and thickened still further, clouds are generated, and thus a change made into water. And
that hail is produced when the water borne down from the clouds becomes congealed; and
that snow is generated when these very clouds, being more moist, acquire congelation; and
that lightning is caused when the clouds are parted by force of the winds; for when these
are sundered there is produced a brilliant and fiery flash. And that a rainbow is produced
by reason of the rays of the sun falling on the collected air. And that an earthquake takes
place when the earth is altered into a larger (bulk) by heat and cold. These indeed, then,

<head>Chapter VII.—Anaxagoras; His Theory of Mind; Recognises an Efficient Cause; His
Cosmogony and Astronomy.</head>
<p>After this (thinker) comes Anaxagoras,82 son of Hegesibulus,83 a native of Clazomenæ.
This person affirmed the originating principle of the universe to be mind and matter; mind
being the efficient cause, whereas matter that which was being formed. For all things coming
into existence simultaneously, mind supervening introduced order. And material principles,
he says, are infinite; even the smaller of these are infinite.84 And that all things partake of
motion by being moved by mind, and that similar bodies coalesce. And that celestial bodies
were arranged by orbicular motion. That, therefore, what was thick and moist, and dark
and cold, and all things heavy, came together into the centre, from the solidification of which
earth derived support; but that the things opposite to these—namely, heat and brilliancy,
and dryness and lightness—hurried impetuously into the farther portion of the atmosphere.
And that the earth is in figure plane; and that it continues suspended aloft, by reason of its
magnitude, and by reason of there being no vacuum, and by reason of the air, which was
most powerful, bearing along the wafted earth. But that among moist substances on earth,
was the sea, and the waters in it; and when these evaporated (from the sun), or had settled
under, that the ocean was formed in this manner, as well as from the rivers that from time
to time flow into it. And that the rivers also derive support from the rains and from the actual
waters in the earth; for that this is hollow, and contains water in its caverns. And that
the Nile is inundated in summer, by reason of the waters carried down into it from the
snows in northern (latitudes).85 And that the sun and moon and all the stars are fiery stones,
that were rolled round by the rotation of the atmosphere. And that beneath the stars are
sun and moon, and certain invisible bodies that are carried along with us; and that we have
no perception of the heat of the stars, both on account of their being so far away, and on
account of their distance from the earth; and further, they are not to the same degree hot
as the sun, on account of their occupying a colder situation. And that the moon, being lower
than the sun, is nearer us. And that the sun surpasses the Peloponnesus in size. And that
the moon has not light of its own, but from the sun. But that the revolution of the stars takes
place under the earth. And that the moon is eclipsed when the earth is interposed, and oc-

casionally also those (stars) that are underneath the moon. And that the sun (is eclipsed)
when, at the beginning of the month, the moon is interposed. And that the solstices are
caused by both sun and moon being repulsed by the air. And that the moon is often turned,
by its not being able to make head against the cold. This person was the first to frame
definitions regarding eclipses and illuminations. And he affirmed that the moon is earthy,
and has in it plains and ravines. And that the milky way is a reflection of the light of the
stars which do not derive their radiance from the sun;86 and that the stars, coursing (the
firmament) as shooting sparks, arise out of the motion of the pole. And that winds are caused
when the atmosphere is rarified by the sun, and by those burning orbs that advance under
the pole, and are borne from (it). And that thunder and lightning are caused by heat falling
on the clouds. And that earthquakes are produced by the air above falling on that under the
earth; for when this is moved, that the earth also, being wafted by it, is shaken. And that
animals originally came into existence87 in moisture, and after this one from another; and
that males are procreated when the seed secreted from the right parts adhered to the right
parts of the womb, and that females are born when the contrary took place. This philosopher

<head>Chapter VIII.—Archelaus; System Akin to that of Anaxagoras; His Origin of the
Earth and of Animals; Other Systems.</head>
<p>Archelaus was by birth an Athenian, and son of Apollodorus.89 This person, similarly
with Anaxagoras, asserted the mixture of matter, and enunciated his first principles in the
same manner. This philosopher, however, held that there is inherent immediately in mind
a certain mixture; and that the originating principle of motion is the mutual separation of
heat and cold, and that the heat is moved, and that the cold remains at rest. And that the
water, being dissolved, flows towards the centre, where the scorched air and earth are produced,
of which the one is borne upwards and the other remains beneath. And that the earth
is at rest, and that on this account it came into existence; and that it lies in the centre, being
no part, so to speak, of the universe, delivered from the conflagration; and that from this,
first in a state of ignition, is the nature of the stars, of which indeed the largest is the sun,
and next to this the moon; and of the rest some less, but some greater. And he says that the
heaven was inclined at an angle, and so that the sun diffused light over the earth, and made
the atmosphere transparent, and the ground dry; for that at first it was a sea, inasmuch as
it is lofty at the horizon and hollow in the middle. And he adduces, as an indication of the
hollowness, that the sun does not rise and set to all at the same time, which ought to happen
if the earth was even. And with regard to animals, he affirms that the earth, being originally
fire in its lower part, where the heat and cold were intermingled, both the rest of animals
made their appearance, numerous and dissimilar,90 all having the same food, being nourished
from mud; and their existence was of short duration, but afterwards also generation from
one another arose unto them; and men were separated from the rest (of the animal creation),
and they appointed rulers, and laws, and arts, and cities, and the rest. And he asserts that
mind is innate in all animals alike; for that each, according to the difference of their physical
constitution, employed (mind), at one time slower, at another faster.91</p>
<p>Natural philosophy, then, continued from Thales until Archelaus. Socrates was the
hearer of this (latter philosopher). There are, however, also very many others, introducing
various opinions respecting both the divinity and the nature of the universe; and if we were
disposed to adduce all the opinions of these, it would be necessary to compose a vast

he makes statements similarly with Leucippus concerning elements, viz., plenitude and vacuum,
denominating plenitude entity, and vacuum nonentity; and this he asserted, since
existing things are continually moved in the vacuum. And he maintained worlds to be infinite,
and varying in bulk; and that in some there is neither sun nor moon, while in others that
they are larger than with us, and with others more numerous. And that intervals between
worlds are unequal; and that in one quarter of space (worlds) are more numerous, and in
another less so; and that some of them increase in bulk, but that others attain their full size,
while others dwindle away and that in one quarter they are coming into existence, whilst
in another they are failing; and that they are destroyed by clashing one with another. And
that some worlds are destitute of animals and plants, and every species of moisture. And
that the earth of our world was created before that of the stars, and that the moon is underneath;
next (to it) the sun; then the fixed stars. And that (neither) the planets nor these (fixed
stars) possess an equal elevation. And that the world flourishes, until no longer it can receive

<lg>
<l>“For if for the most part of perfection man may speak,</l>
<l>Yet he knows it not himself, and in all attains surmise.”</l>

<p>And he affirms that nothing is generated or perishes, or is moved; and that the universe,
being one, is beyond change. But he says that the deity is eternal, and one and altogether
homogeneous and limited, and of a spherical form, and endued with perception in all parts.
And that the sun exists during each day from a conglomeration of small sparks, and that
the earth is infinite, and is surrounded neither by an atmosphere nor by the heaven. And
that there are infinite suns and moons, and that all things spring from earth. This man affirmed
that the sea is salt, on account of the many mixtures that flow into it. Metrodorus,
however, from the fact of its being filtered through earth, asserts that it is on account of this
that it is made salt. And Xenophanes is of opinion that there had been a mixture of the earth
with the sea, and that in process of time it was disengaged from the moisture, alleging that
he could produce such proofs as the following: that in the midst of earth, and in mountains,
shells are discovered; and also in Syracuse he affirms was found in the quarries the print of
a fish and of seals, and in Paros an image of a laurel100 in the bottom of a stone, and in
Melita101 parts of all sorts of marine animals. And he says that these were generated when
all things originally were embedded in mud, and that an impression of them was dried in
the mud, but that all men had perished102 when the earth, being precipitated into the sea,
was converted into mud; then, again, that it originated generation, and that this overthrow
occurred to all worlds.</p>

the objects of sense. But that there is a determinable multitude of these, and that this
is infinite.104 And that bodies are moved neither by weight nor by impact, but by divine
power, which he calls mind and soul; and that of this the world is a representation; wherefore

<head>Chapter XVI.—Plato; Threefold Classification of Principles; His Idea of God; Different
Opinions Regarding His Theology and Psychology; His Eschatology and
System of Metempsychosis; His Ethical Doctrines; Notions on the Free-Will
Question.</head>
<p>Plato (lays down) that there are three originating principles of the universe, (namely)
God, and matter, and exemplar; God as the Maker and Regulator of this universe, and the
Being who exercises providence over it; but matter, as that which underlies all (phenomena),
which (matter) he styles both receptive and a nurse, out of the arrangement of which proceeded
the four elements of which the world consists; (I mean) fire, air, earth, water, from
which all the rest of what are denominated concrete substances, as well as animals and
plants, have been formed. And that the exemplar, which he likewise calls ideas, is the intelligence
of the Deity, to which, as to an image in the soul, the Deity attending, fabricated all
things. God, he says, is both incorporeal and shapeless, and comprehensible by wise men
solely; whereas matter is body potentially, but with potentiality not as yet passing into action,
for being itself without form and without quality, by assuming forms and qualities, it became
body. That matter, therefore, is an originating principle, and coeval with the Deity, and that
in this respect the world is uncreated. For (Plato) affirms that (the world) was made out of
it. And that (the attribute of) imperishableness necessarily belongs to (literally “follows”)
that which is uncreated. So far forth, however, as body is supposed to be compounded out
of both many qualities and ideas, so far forth it is both created and perishable. But some of
the followers of Plato mingled both of these, employing some such example as the following:
That as a waggon can always continue undestroyed, though undergoing partial repairs from
time to time, so that even the parts each in turn perish, yet itself remains always complete;
so after this manner the world also, although in parts it perishes, yet the things that are removed,
being repaired, and equivalents for them being introduced, it remains eternal.</p>
<p>Some maintain that Plato asserts the Deity to be one, ingenerable and incorruptible, as
he says in The Laws: 110 “God, therefore, as the ancient account has it, possesses both the
beginning, and end, and middle of all things.” Thus he shows God to be one, on account of
His having pervaded all things. Others, however, maintain that Plato affirms the existence
of many gods indefinitely, when he uses these words: “God of gods, of whom I am both the
Creator and Father.”111 But others say that he speaks of a definite number of deities in the
following passage: “Therefore the mighty Jupiter, wheeling his swift chariot in heaven;” and
<note type="footnote">110 De Legibus, iv. 7 (p. 109, vol. viii. ed. Bekker).</note>
<note type="footnote">111 Timæus, c. xvi. (p. 277, vol. vii. ed. Bekker). The passage runs thus in the original: “Gods of gods, of whom
I am Creator and Father of works, which having been formed by Me, are indissoluble, through, at all events, My
will.”</note>

<pb n="42"/>
when he enumerates the offspring of the children of heaven and earth. But others assert that
(Plato) constituted the gods as generable; and on account of their having been produced,
that altogether they were subject to the necessity of corruption, but that on account of the
will of God they are immortal, (maintaining this) in the passage already quoted, where, to
the words, “God of gods, of whom I am Creator and Father,” he adds, “indissoluble through
the fiat of My will;” so that if (God) were disposed that these should be dissolved, they would
easily be dissolved.</p>
<p>And he admits natures (such as those) of demons, and says that some of them are good,
but others worthless. And some affirm that he states the soul to be uncreated and immortal,
when he uses the following words, “Every soul is immortal, for that which is always moved
is immortal;” and when he demonstrates that the soul is self-moved, and capable of originating
motion. Others, however, (say that Plato asserted that the soul was) created, but
rendered imperishable through the will of God. But some (will have it that he considered
the soul) a composite (essence), and generable and corruptible; for even he supposes that
there is a receptacle for it,112 and that it possesses a luminous body, but that everything
generated involves a necessity of corruption.113 Those, however, who assert the immortality
of the soul are especially strengthened in their opinion by those passages114 (in Plato’s
writings), where he says, that both there are judgments after death, and tribunals of justice
in Hades, and that the virtuous (souls) receive a good reward, while the wicked (ones) suitable
punishment. Some notwithstanding assert, that he also acknowledges a transition of souls
from one body to another, and that different souls, those that were marked out for such a
purpose, pass into different bodies,115 according to the desert of each, and that after116
certain definite periods they are sent up into this world to furnish once more a proof of their
choice. Others, however, (do not admit this to be his doctrine, but will have it that Plato
affirms that the souls) obtain a place according to the desert of each; and they employ as a
testimony the saying of his, that some good men are with Jove, and that others are ranging
abroad (through heaven) with other gods; whereas that others are involved in eternal punishments,
as many as during this life have committed wicked and unjust deeds.</p>

<p>And people affirm that Plato says, that some things are without a mean, that others have
a mean, that others are a mean. (For example, that) waking and sleep, and such like, are
conditions without an intermediate state; but that there are things that had means, for instance
virtue and vice; and there are means (between extremes), for instance grey between
white and black, or some other colour. And they say, that he affirms that the things pertaining
to the soul are absolutely alone good, but that the things pertaining to the body, and those
external (to it), are not any longer absolutely good, but reputed blessings. And that frequently
he names these means also, for that it is possible to use them both well and ill. Some virtues,
therefore, he says, are extremes in regard of intrinsic worth, but in regard of their essential
nature means, for nothing is more estimable than virtue. But whatever excels or falls short
of these terminates in vice. For instance, he says that there are four virtues—prudence,
temperance, justice, fortitude—and that on each of these is attendant two vices, according
to excess and defect: for example, on prudence, recklessness according to defect, and knavery
according to excess; and on temperance, licentiousness according to defect, stupidity according
to excess; and on justice, foregoing a claim according to defect, unduly pressing it according
to excess; and on fortitude, cowardice according to defect, foolhardiness according
to excess. And that these virtues, when inherent in a man, render him perfect, and afford
him happiness. And happiness, he says, is assimilation to the Deity, as far as this is possible;
and that assimilation to God takes place when any one combines holiness and justice with
prudence. For this he supposes the end of supreme wisdom and virtue. And he affirms that
the virtues follow one another in turn,117 and are uniform, and are never antagonistic to
each other; whereas that vices are multiform, and sometimes follow one the other, and
sometimes are antagonistic to each other. He asserts that fate exists; not, to be sure, that all
things are produced according to fate, but that there is even something in our power, as in
the passages where he says, “The fault is his who chooses, God is blameless;” and “the following
law118 of Adrasteia.”119 And thus some (contend for his upholding) a system of fate,
whereas others one of free-will. He asserts, however, that sins are involuntary. For into what
is most glorious of the things in our power, which is the soul, no one would (deliberately)
admit what is vicious, that is, transgression, but that from ignorance and an erroneous
conception of virtue, supposing that they were achieving something honourable, they pass
into vice. And his doctrine on this point is most clear in The Republic,120 where he says,
“But, again, you presume to assert that vice is disgraceful and abhorred of God; how then,
<note type="footnote">117 Diogenes Laertius, in describing the system of the Stoics, employs the same word in the case of their view
of virtue.</note>

I may ask, would one choose such an evil thing? He, you reply, (would do so) who is worsted
by pleasures.121 Therefore this also is involuntary, if to gain a victory be voluntary; so that,
in every point of view, the committing an act of turpitude, reason proves122 to be involuntary.”
Some one, however, in opposition to this (Plato), advances the contrary statement,
“Why then are men punished if they sin involuntary?” But he replies, that he himself also,
as soon as possible, may be emancipated from vice, and undergo punishment. For that the
undergoing punishment is not an evil, but a good thing, if it is likely to prove a purification
of evils; and that the rest of mankind, hearing of it, may not transgress, but guard against
such an error. (Plato, however, maintains) that the nature of evil is neither created by the
Deity, nor possesses subsistence of itself, but that it derives existence from contrariety to
what is good, and from attendance upon it, either by excess and defect, as we have previously
affirmed concerning the virtues. Plato unquestionably then, as we have already stated, collecting
together the three departments of universal philosophy, in this manner formed his
speculative system.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Aristotle; Duality of Principles; His Categories; His Psychology; His
Ethical Doctrines; Origin of the Epithet “Peripatetic.”</head>
<p>Aristotle, who was a pupil of this (Plato), reduced philosophy into an art, and was distinguished
rather for his proficiency in logical science, supposing as the elements of all things
substance and accident; that there is one substance underlying all things, but nine acci-
dents,—namely, quantity, quality, relation, where, when, possession, posture, action, passion;
and that substance is of some such description as God, man, and each of the beings that can
fall under a similar denomination. But in regard of accidents, quality is seen in, for instance,
white, black; and quantity, for instance two cubits, three cubits; and relation, for instance
father, son; and where, for instance at Athens, Megara; and when, for instance during the
tenth Olympiad; and possession, for instance to have acquired; and action, for instance to
write, and in general to evince any practical powers; and posture, for instance to lie down;
and passion, for instance to be struck. He also supposes that some things have means, but
that others are without means, as we have declared concerning Plato likewise. And in most
points he is in agreement with Plato, except the opinion concerning soul. For Plato affirms
it to be immortal, but Aristotle that it involves permanence; and after these things, that this
also vanishes in the fifth body,123 which he supposes, along with the other four (elements),—
viz., fire, and earth, and water, and air,—to be a something more subtle (than
these), of the nature of spirit. Plato therefore says, that the only really good things are those
pertaining to the soul, and that they are sufficient for happiness; whereas Aristotle introduces
a threefold classification of good things, and asserts that the wise man is not perfect, unless
there are present to him both the good things of the body and those extrinsic to it.124 The
former are beauty, strength, vigour of the senses, soundness; while the things extrinsic (to
the body) are wealth, nobility, glory, power, peace, friendship.125 And the inner qualities
of the soul he classifies, as it was the opinion of Plato, under prudence, temperance, justice,
fortitude. This (philosopher) also affirms that evils arise according to an opposition of the
things that are good, and that they exist beneath the quarter around the moon, but reach
no farther beyond the moon; and that the soul of the entire world is immortal, and that the
world itself is eternal, but that (the soul) in an individual, as we have before stated, vanishes
(in the fifth body). This (speculator), then holding discussions in the Lyceum, drew up from
time to time his system of philosophy; but Zeno (held his school) in the porch called Poecilé.
And the followers of Zeno obtained their name from the place—that is, from Stoa—(i.e., a
<note type="footnote">123 Or, “the fifth body, in which it is supposed to be, along with the other four (elements);” or, “the fifth body,

porch), being styled Stoics; whereas Aristotle’s followers (were denominated) from their
mode of employing themselves while teaching. For since they were accustomed walking
about in the Lyceum to pursue their investigations, on this account they were called Peripatetics.

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The Stoics; Their Superiority in Logic; Fatalists; Their Doctrine of
Conflagrations.</head>
<p>The Stoics themselves also imparted growth to philosophy, in respect of a greater development
of the art of syllogism, and included almost everything under definitions, both
Chrysippus and Zeno being coincident in opinion on this point. And they likewise supposed
God to be the one originating principle of all things, being a body of the utmost refinement,
and that His providential care pervaded everything; and these speculators were positive
about the existence of fate everywhere, employing some such example as the following: that
just as a dog, supposing him attached to a car, if indeed he is disposed to follow, both is
drawn,126 or follows voluntarily, making an exercise also of free power, in combination
with necessity, that is, fate; but if he may not be disposed to follow, he will altogether be
coerced to do so. And the same, of course, holds good in the case of men. For though not
willing to follow, they will altogether be compelled to enter upon what has been decreed for
them. (The Stoics), however, assert that the soul abides after death,127 but that it is a body,
and that such is formed from the refrigeration of the surrounding atmosphere; wherefore,
also, that it was called psyche (i.e., soul). And they acknowledge likewise, that there is a
transition of souls from one body to another, that is, for those souls for whom this migration
has been destined. And they accept the doctrine, that there will be a conflagration, a purification
of this world, some say the entire of it, but others a portion, and that (the world) itself
is undergoing partial destruction; and this all but corruption, and the generation from it of
another world, they term purgation. And they assume the existence of all bodies, and that
body does not pass through body,128 but that a refraction129 takes place, and that all things
involve plenitude, and that there is no vacuum. The foregoing are the opinions of the Stoics
also.</p>
<note type="footnote">126 One of the mss. elucidates the simile in the text thus: “But if he is not disposed, there is absolutely a necessity
for his being drawn along. And in like manner men, if they do not follow fate, seem to be free agents,

absolutely be coerced to enter upon what has been fore-ordained.”</note>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Epicurus; Adopts the Democritic Atomism; Denial of Divine
Providence; The Principle of His Ethical System.</head>
<p>Epicurus, however, advanced an opinion almost contrary to all. He supposed, as originating
principles of all things, atoms and vacuity.130 He considered vacuity as the place that
would contain the things that will exist, and atoms the matter out of which all things could
be formed; and that from the concourse of atoms both the Deity derived existence, and all
the elements, and all things inherent in them, as well as animals and other (creatures); so
that nothing was generated or existed, unless it be from atoms. And he affirmed that these
atoms were composed of extremely small particles, in which there could not exist either a
point or a sign, or any division; wherefore also he called them atoms. Acknowledging the
Deity to be eternal and incorruptible, he says that God has providential care for nothing,
and that there is no such thing at all as providence or fate, but that all things are made by
chance. For that the Deity reposed in the intermundane spaces, (as they) are thus styled by
him; for outside the world he determined that there is a certain habitation of God, denominated
“the intermundane spaces,” and that the Deity surrendered Himself to pleasure, and
took His ease in the midst of supreme happiness; and that neither has He any concerns of
business, nor does He devote His attention to them.131 As a consequence on these opinions,
he also propounded his theory concerning wise men, asserting that the end of wisdom is
pleasure. Different persons, however, received the term “pleasure” in different acceptations;
for some (among the Gentiles132 understood) the passions, but others the satisfaction resulting
from virtue. And he concluded that the souls of men are dissolved along with their
bodies, just as also they were produced along with them, for that they are blood, and that
when this has gone forth or been altered, the entire man perishes; and in keeping with this
tenet, (Epicurus maintained) that there are neither trials in Hades, nor tribunals of justice;
so that whatsoever any one may commit in this life, that, provided he may escape detection,
he is altogether beyond any liability of trial (for it in a future state). In this way, then, Epicurus
also formed his opinions.</p>
<note type="footnote">130 The atomic theory is, as already mentioned by Hippolytus, of more ancient date than Epicurus’ age, being
first broached by Leucippus and Democritus. This fact, however, has, as Cudworth argues, been frequently
overlooked by those who trace the doctrine to no older a source than the founder of the Epicurean philosophy.</note>

the vicious pagan.</note>

<head>Chapter XX.—The Academics; Difference of Opinion Among Them.</head>
<p>And another opinion of the philosophers was called that of the Academics,133 on account
of those holding their discussions in the Academy, of whom the founder Pyrrho, from whom
they were called Pyrrhonean philosophers, first introduced the notion of the incomprehensibility
of all things, so as to (be ready to) attempt an argument on either side of a question,
but not to assert anything for certain; for that there is nothing of things intelligible or sensible
true, but that they appear to men to be so; and that all substance is in a state of flux and
change, and never continues in the same (condition). Some followers, then, of the Academics
say that one ought not to declare an opinion on the principle of anything, but simply making
the attempt to give it up; whereas others subjoined the formulary “not rather”134 (this than
that), saying that the fire is not rather fire than anything else. But they did not declare what
this is, but what sort it is.135</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—The Brachmans; Their Mode of Life; Ideas of Deity; Different Sorts
Of; Their Ethical Notions.</head>
<p>But there is also with the Indians a sect composed of those philosophizing among the
Brachmans. They spend a contented existence, abstain both from living creatures and all
cooked food, being satisfied with fruits; and not gathering these from the trees, but carrying
off those that have fallen to the earth. They subsist upon them, drinking the water of the
river Tazabena.136 But they pass their life naked, affirming that the body has been constituted
a covering to the soul by the Deity. These affirm that God is light, not such as one sees, nor
such as the sun and fire; but to them the Deity is discourse, not that which finds expression
in articulate sounds, but that of the knowledge through which the secret mysteries of
nature137 are perceived by the wise. And this light which they say is discourse, their god,
they assert that the Brachmans only know on account of their alone rejecting all vanity of
opinion which is the soul’s ultimate covering.138 These despise death, and always in their
own peculiar language139 call God by the name which we have mentioned previously, and
they send up hymns (to him). But neither are there women among them, nor do they beget
children. But they who aim at a life similar to these, after they have crossed over to the
country on the opposite side of the river, continue to reside there, returning no more; and
these also are called Brachmans. But they do not pass their life similarly, for there are also
in the place women, of whom those that dwell there are born, and in turn beget children.
And this discourse which140 they name God they assert to be corporeal, and enveloped in
a body outside himself, just as if one were wearing a sheep’s skin, but that on divesting
himself of body that he would appear clear to the eye. But the Brachmans say that there is
a conflict in the body that surrounds them, (and they consider that the body is for them full

this (covering), would appear visible to the naked eye.” Or, “This discourse whom they name God they affirm
to be incorporeal, but enveloped in a body outside himself (or his own body) (just as if one carried a covering
of sheepskin to have it seen); but having stripped off the body in which he is enveloped, that he no longer appears
visible to the naked eye.” (Roeper.) I am not very confident that this exactly conveys the meaning of Roeper’s
somewhat obscure Greek paraphrase.</note>

contend, as we have already explained. And they say that all men are captive to their own
congenital struggles, viz., sensuality and inchastity, gluttony, anger, joy, sorrow, concupiscence,
and such like. And he who has reared a trophy over these, alone goes to God;
wherefore the Brachmans deify Dandamis, to whom Alexander the Macedonian paid a visit,
as one who had proved victorious in the bodily conflict. But they bear down on Calanus as
having profanely withdrawn from their philosophy. But the Brachmans, putting off the
body, like fishes jumping out of water into the pure air, behold the sun.</p>

<p>But Hesiod the poet asserts himself also that he thus heard from the Muses concerning
nature, and that the Muses are the daughters of Jupiter. For when for nine nights and days
together, Jupiter, through excess of passion, had uninterruptedly lain with Mnemosyne,
that Mnemosyne conceived in one womb those nine Muses, becoming pregnant with one
during each night. Having then summoned the nine Muses from Pieria, that is, Olympus,
he exhorted them to undergo instruction:—
<lg>
<l>“How first both gods and earth were made,144</l>
<l>And rivers, and boundless deep, and ocean’s surge,</l>
<l>And glittering stars, and spacious heaven above;</l>
<l>How they grasped the crown and shared the glory,</l>
<l>And how at first they held the many-valed Olympus.</l>
<l>These (truths), ye Muses, tell me of, saith he,</l>
<l>From first, and next which of them first arose.</l>
<l>Chaos, no doubt, the very first, arose; but next</l>
<l>Wide-stretching Earth, ever the throne secure of all</l>
<l>Immortals, who hold the peaks of white Olympus;</l>
<l>And breezy Tartarus in wide earth’s recess;</l>
<l>And Love, who is most beauteous of the gods immortal,</l>
<l>Chasing care away from all the gods and men,</l>
<l>Quells in breasts the mind and counsel sage.</l>
<l>But Erebus from Chaos and gloomy Night arose;</l>
<l>And, in turn, from Night both Air and Day were born;</l>
<l>But primal Earth, equal to self in sooth begot</l>
<l>The stormy sky to veil it round on every side,</l>
<l>Ever to be for happy gods a throne secure.</l>
<l>And forth she brought the towering hills, the pleasant haunts</l>
<l>Of nymphs who dwell throughout the woody heights.</l>
</lg>
<note type="footnote">144 There are several verbal differences from the original in Hippolytus’ version. These may be seen on
comparing it with Hesiod’s own text. The particular place which Hesiod occupies in the history of philosophy
is pointed out by Aristotle in his Metaphysics. The Stagyrite detects in the Hesiodic cosmogony, in the principle
of “love,” the dawn of a recognition of the necessity of an efficient cause to account for the phenomena of nature.
It was Aristotle himself, however, who built up the science of causation; and in this respect humanity owes that
extraordinary man a deep debt of gratitude.</note>

</p>
<p>And all the rest of the giants from Cronus, Hesiod enumerates, and somewhere after-
wards that Jupiter was born of Rhea. All these, then, made the foregoing statements in their
doctrine regarding both the nature and generation of the universe. But all, sinking below
what is divine, busied themselves concerning the substance of existing things,146 being astonished
at the magnitude of creation, and supposing that it constituted the Deity, each
speculator selecting in preference a different portion of the world; failing, however, to discern
the God and maker of these.</p>
<p>The opinions, therefore, of those who have attempted to frame systems of philosophy
among the Greeks, I consider that we have sufficiently explained; and from these the heretics,

vain expectations, rather than to profit it. And we urge our case with these, not according
to any experience of the art, but from knowledge based on practical principles. Those who
have cultivated the art, becoming disciples of the Chaldeans, and communicating mysteries
as if strange and astonishing to men, having changed the names (merely), have from this
source concocted their heresy. But since, estimating the astrological art as a powerful one,
and availing themselves of the testimonies adduced by its patrons, they wish to gain reliance
for their own attempted conclusions, we shall at present, as it has seemed expedient, prove
the astrological art to be untenable, as our intention next is to invalidate also the Peratic
system, as a branch growing out of an unstable root.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Horoscope the Foundation of Astrology; Indiscoverability of the
Horoscope; Therefore the Futility of the Chaldean Art.</head>
<p>The originating principle,151 and, as it were, foundation, of the entire art, is fixing152
the horoscope.153 For from this are derived the rest of the cardinal points, as well as the
declinations and ascensions, the triangles and squares, and the configurations of the stars
in accordance with these; and from all these the predictions are taken. Whence, if the
horoscope be removed, it necessarily follows that neither any celestial object is recognisable
in the meridian, or at the horizon, or in the point of the heavens opposite the meridian; but
if these be not comprehended, the entire system of the Chaldeans vanishes along with (them).
But that the sign of the horoscope is indiscoverable by them, we may show by a variety of
arguments. For in order that this (horoscope) may be found, it is first requisite that the (time
of) birth of the person falling under inspection should be firmly fixed; and secondly, that
the horoscope which is to signify this should be infallible; and thirdly, that the ascension154
of the zodiacal sign should be observed with accuracy. For from155 (the moment) of birth156
the ascension of the zodiacal sign rising in the heaven should be closely watched,157 since
the Chaldeans, determining (from this) the horoscope, frame the configuration of the stars
in accordance with the ascension (of the sign); and they term this—disposition, in accordance
with which they devise their predictions. But neither is it possible to take the birth of persons,
falling under consideration, as I shall explain, nor is the horoscope infallible, nor is the rising
zodiacal sign apprehended with accuracy.</p>
<p>How it is, then, that the system of the Chaldeans158 is unstable, let us now declare.
Having, then, previously marked it out for investigation, they draw the birth of persons
falling under consideration from, unquestionably, the depositing of the seed, and (from)
conception or from parturition. And if one will attempt to take (the horoscope) from con-

above the horizon at the moment of parturition. This was the “horoscope ascendant,” or “first house.” The circuit

ception, the accurate account of this is incomprehensible, the time (occupied) passing
quickly, and naturally (so). For we are not able to say whether conception takes place upon
the transference159 of the seed or not. For this can happen even as quick as thought, just
also as leaven, when put into heated jars, immediately is reduced to a glutinous state. But
conception can also (take place) after a lapse of duration. For there being an interval from
the mouth of the womb to the fundament, where physicians160 say conceptions take place,
it is altogether the nature of the seed deposited to occupy some time in traversing161 this
interval. The Chaldeans, therefore, being ignorant of the quantity of duration to a nicety,
never will comprehend the (moment of) conception; the seed at one time being injected
straight forward, and falling at one spot upon actual parts of the womb well disposed for
conception, and at another time dropping into it dispersedly, and being collected into one
place by uterine energies. Now, while these matters are unknown, (namely), as to when the
first takes place, and when the second, and how much time is spent in that particular conception,
and how much in this; while, I say, ignorance on these points prevails on the part
of these (astrologers), an accurate comprehension of conception is put out of the question.162
And if, as some natural philosophers have asserted, the seed, remaining stationary first, and
undergoing alteration in the womb, then enters the (womb’s) opened blood-vessels, as the
seeds of the earth163 sink into the ground; from this it will follow, that those who are not
acquainted with the quantity of time occupied by the change, will not be aware of the precise
moment of conception either. And, moreover, as women164 differ from one another in the
other parts of the body, both as regards energy and in other respects, so also (it is reasonable
to suppose that they differ from one another) in respect of energy of womb, some conceiving
quicker, and others slower. And this is not strange, since also women, when themselves
compared with themselves, at times are observed having a strong disposition towards conception,
but at times with no such tendency. And when this is so, it is impossible to say with
accuracy when the deposited seed coalesces, in order that from this time the Chaldeans may
fix the horoscope of the birth.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Impossibility of Fixing the Horoscope; Failure of an Attempt to Do
This at the Period of Birth.</head>
<p>For this reason it is impossible to fix the horoscope from the (period of) conception.
But neither can this be done from (that of) birth. For, in the first place, there exists the difficulty
as to when it can be declared that there is a birth; whether it is when the foetus begins
to incline towards the orifice,165 or when it may project a little, or when it may be borne to
the ground. Neither is it in each of these cases possible to comprehend the precise moment
of parturition,166 or to define the time. For also on account of disposition of soul, and on
account of suitableness of body, and on account of choice of the parts, and on account of
experience in the midwife, and other endless causes, the time is not the same at which the
foetus inclines towards the orifice, when the membranes are ruptured, or when it projects
a little, or is deposited on the ground; but the period is different in the case of different individuals.
And when the Chaldeans are not able definitely and accurately to calculate this,
they will fail, as they ought, to determine the period of emergence.</p>
<p>That, then, the Chaldeans profess to be acquainted with the horoscope at the periods
of birth,167 but in reality do not know it, is evident from these considerations. But that
neither is their horoscope infallible, it is easy to conclude. For when they allege that the
person sitting beside the woman in travail at the time of parturition gives, by striking a
metallic rim, a sign to the Chaldean, who from an elevated place is contemplating the stars,
and he, looking towards heaven, marks down the rising zodiacal sign; in the first place, we
shall prove to them, that when parturition happens indefinitely, as we have shown a little
before, neither is it easy168 to signify this (birth) by striking the metallic rim. However, grant
that the birth is comprehensible, yet neither is it possible to signify this at the exact time;
for as the noise of the metallic plate is capable of being divided by a longer time and one
protracted, in reference to perception, it happens that the sound is carried to the height
(with proportionate delay). And the following proof may be observed in the case of those
felling timber at a distance. For a sufficiently long time after the descent of the axe, the sound
of the stroke is heard, so that it takes a longer time to reach the listener. And for this reason,
therefore, it is not possible for the Chaldeans accurately to take the time of the rising zodiacal
sign, and consequently the time when one can make the horoscope with truth. And not
only does more time seem to elapse after parturition, when he who is sitting beside the woman
in labour strikes the metallic plate, and next after the sound reaches the listener, that is, the
person who has gone up to the elevated position; but also, while he is glancing around and

looking to ascertain in which of the zodiacal signs is the moon, and in which appears each
of the rest of the stars, it necessarily follows that there is a different position in regard of the
stars, the motion169 of the pole whirling them on with incalculable velocity, before what is

<head>Chapter V.—Another Method of Fixing the Horoscope at Birth; Equally Futile; Use
of the Clepsydra in Astrology; The Predictions of the Chaldeans Not Verified.</head>
<p>In this way, the art practised by the Chaldeans will be shown to be unstable. Should any
one, however, allege that, by questions put to him who inquires from the Chaldeans,171 the
birth can be ascertained, not even by this plan is it possible to arrive at the precise period.
For if, supposing any such attention on their part in reference to their art to be on record,
even these do not attain—as we have proved—unto accuracy either, how, we ask, can an
unsophisticated individual comprehend precisely the time of parturition, in order that the
Chaldean acquiring the requisite information from this person may set172 the horoscope
correctly? But neither from the appearance of the horizon will the rising star seem the same
everywhere; but in one place its declination will be supposed to be the horoscope, and in
another the ascension (will be thought) the horoscope, according as the places come into
view, being either lower or higher. Wherefore, also, from this quarter an accurate prediction
will not appear, since many may be born throughout the entire world at the same hour, each
from a different direction observing the stars.</p>
<p>But the supposed comprehension (of the period of parturition) by means of clepsydras173
is likewise futile. For the contents of the jar will not flow out in the same time when it is full
as when it is half empty; yet, according to their own account, the pole itself by a single impulse
is whirled along at an equable velocity. If, however, evading the argument,174 they should
affirm that they do not take the time precisely, but as it happens in any particular latitude,175
they will be refuted almost by the sidereal influences themselves. For those who have been
born at the same time do not spend the same life, but some, for example, have been made
kings, and others have grown old in fetters. There has been born none equal, at all events,
to Alexander the Macedonian, though many were brought forth along with him throughout
the earth; (and) none equal to the philosopher Plato. Wherefore the Chaldean, examining
the time of the birth in any particular latitude, will not be able to say accurately, whether a

person born at this time will be prosperous. Many, I take it, born at this time, have been
unfortunate, so that the similarity according to dispositions is futile.</p>
<p>Having, then, by different reasons and various methods, refuted the ineffectual mode
of examination adopted by the Chaldeans, neither shall we omit this, namely, to show that
their predictions will eventuate in inexplicable difficulties. For if, as the mathematicians
assert, it is necessary that one born under the barb of Sagittarius’ arrow should meet with
a violent death, how was it that so many myriads of the Barbarians that fought with the
Greeks at Marathon or Salamis176 were simultaneously slaughtered? For unquestionably
there was not the same horoscope in the case, at all events, of them all. And again, it is said
that one born under the urn of Aquarius will suffer shipwreck: (yet) how is it that so many177
of the Greeks that returned from Troy were overwhelmed in the deep around the indented
shores of Euboea? For it is incredible that all, distant from one another by a long interval of
duration, should have been born under the urn of Aquarius. For it is not reasonable to say,
that frequently, for one whose fate it was to be destroyed in the sea, all who were with him
in the same vessel should perish. For why should the doom of this man subdue the (destinies)
of all? Nay, but why, on account of one for whom it was allotted to die on land, should not
all be preserved?</p>

<p>But since also they frame an account concerning the action of the zodiacal signs, to
which they say the creatures that are procreated are assimilated,178 neither shall we omit
this: as, for instance, that one born in Leo will be brave; and that one born in Virgo will have
long straight hair,179 be of a fair complexion, childless, modest. These statements, however,
and others similar to them, are rather deserving of laughter than serious consideration. For,
according to them, it is possible for no Æthiopian to be born in Virgo; otherwise he would
allow that such a one is white, with long straight hair and the rest. But I am rather of opinion,
180 that the ancients imposed the names of received animals upon certain specified stars,
for the purpose of knowing them better, not from any similarity of nature; for what have
the seven stars, distant one from another, in common with a bear, or the five stars with the
head of a dragon?—in regard of which Aratus181 says:—

</p>
<note type="footnote">178 This was the great doctrine of astrology, the forerunner of the science of astronomy. Astrology seems to
have arisen first among the Chaldeans, out of the fundamental principle of their religion—the assimilation of
the divine nature to light. This tenet introduced another, the worship of the stars, which was developed into
astrology. Others suppose astrology to have been of Arabian or Egyptian origin. From some of these sources it
reached the Greeks, and through them the Romans, who held the astrologic art in high repute. The art, after
having become almost extinct, was revived by the Arabians at the verve of the middle ages. For the history of
astrology one must consult the writings of Manilius, Julius Firmicus, and Ptolemy. Its greatest mediæval apologist
is Cardan, the famous physician of Pavia (see his work, De Astron. Judic., lib. vi.–ix. tom. v. of his collected
works).</note>

versified account of the motions of the stars, and of sidereal influence over men. This work seems to have been
a great favourite with scholars, if we are to judge from the many excellent annotated editions of it that have appeared.
Two of these deserve notice, viz., Grotius’ Leyden edition, 1600, in Greek and Latin; and Buhle’s edition,
Leipsic, 1803. See also Dionysius Petavius’ Uranologion. Aratus must always be famous, from the fact that St.
Paul (Acts xiii. 28) quotes the fifth line of the Phænomena. Cicero considered Aratus a noble poet, and translated
the Phænomena into Latin, a fragment of which has been preserved, and is in Grotius’ edition. Aratus has been
translated into English verse, with notes by Dr. Lamb, Dean of Bristol (London: J. W. Parker, 1858).</note>

<p>In this manner also, that these points are not deserving so much labour, is evident to
those who prefer to think correctly, and do not attend to the bombast of the Chaldeans,
who consign monarchs to utter obscurity, by perfecting cowardice182 in them, and rouse
private individuals to dare great exploits. But if any one, surrendering himself to evil, is
guilty of delinquency, he who has been thus deceived does not become a teacher to all whom
the Chaldeans are disposed to mislead by their mistakes. (Far from it); (these astrologers)
impel the minds (of their dupes, as they would have them), into endless perturbation, (when)
they affirm that a configuration of the same stars could not return to a similar position,
otherwise than by the renewal of the Great Year, through a space of seven thousand seven
hundred and seventy and seven years.183 How then, I ask, will human observation for one
birth be able to harmonize with so many ages; and this not once, (but oftentimes, when a
destruction of the world, as some have stated, would intercept the progress of this Great
Year; or a terrestrial convulsion, though partial, would utterly break the continuity of the
historical tradition)?184 The Chaldaic art must necessarily be refuted by a greater number
of arguments, although we have been reminding (our readers) of it on account of other
circumstances, not peculiarly on account of the art itself.</p>
<p>Since, however, we have determined to omit none of the opinions advanced by Gentile
philosophers, on account of the notorious knavery of the heretics, let us see what they also
say who have attempted to propound doctrines concerning magnitudes,—who, observing
the fruitless labour of the majority (of speculators), where each after a different fashion
coined his own falsehoods and attained celebrity, have ventured to make some greater assertion,
in order that they might be highly magnified by those who mightily extol their contemptible
lies. These suppose the existence of circles, and measures, and triangles, and
squares, both in twofold and threefold array. Their argumentation, however, in regard of
this matter, is extensive, yet it is not necessary in reference to the subject which we have
taken in hand.</p>

<p>I reckon it then sufficient to declare the prodigies185 detailed by these men. Wherefore,
employing condensed accounts of what they affirm, I shall turn my attention to the other
points (that remain to be considered). Now they make the following statements.186 The
Creator communicated pre-eminent power to the orbital motion of the identical and similar
(circle), for He permitted the revolution of it to be one and indivisible; but after dividing
this internally into six parts, (and thus having formed) seven unequal circles, according to
each interval of a twofold and threefold dimension, He commanded, since there were three
of each, that the circles should travel in orbits contrary to one another, three indeed (out of
the aggregate of seven) being whirled along with equal velocity, and four of them with a
speed dissimilar to each other and to the remaining three, yet (all) according to a definite
principle. For he affirms that the mastery was communicated to the orbital motion of the
same (circle), not only since it embraces the motion of the other, that, is, the erratic stars,
but because also it possesses so great mastery, that is, so great power, that even it leads round,
along with itself, by a peculiar strength of its own, those heavenly bodies—that is, the erratic
stars—that are whirled along in contrary directions from west to east, and, in like manner,
from east to west.</p>
<p>And he asserts that this motion was allowed to be one and indivisible, in the first place,
inasmuch as the revolutions of all the fixed stars were accomplished in equal periods of
time, and were not distinguished according to greater or less portions of duration. In the
next place, they all present the same phase as that which belongs to the outermost motion;
whereas the erratic stars have been distributed into greater and varying periods for the accomplishment
of their movements, and into unequal distances from earth. And he asserts
that the motion in six parts of the other has been distributed probably into seven circles.
For as many as are sections of each (circle)—I allude to monads of the sections187—become
segments; for example, if the division be by one section, there will be two segments; if by
two, three segments; and so, if anything be cut into six parts, there will be seven segments.
And he says that the distances of these are alternately arranged both in double and triple
<note type="footnote">185 As regards astrological predictions, see Origen’s Comment. on Gen.; Diodorus of Tarsus, De Fato; Photii

his almost unintelligible Latin version: “For as many sections as there are of each, there are educible from the
monad more segments than sections; for example, if,” etc. The Abbe Cruice would seemingly adopt the following
version: “For whatsoever are sections of each, now there are more segments than sections of a monad, will become;
for example, if,” etc.</note>

order, there being three of each,—a principle which, he has attempted to prove, holds good
of the composition of the soul likewise, as depending upon the seven numbers. For among
them there are from the monad three double (numbers), viz., 2, 4, 8, and three triple ones,
viz., 3, 9, 27. But the diameter of Earth is 80,108 stadii; and the perimeter of Earth, 250,543
stadii; and the distance also from the surface of the Earth to the lunar circle, Aristarchus the
Samian computes at 8,000,178 stadii, but Apollonius 5,000,000, whereas Archimedes computes188
it at 5,544,130. And from the lunar to solar circle, (according to the last authority,)
are 50,262,065 stadii; and from this to the circle of Venus, 20,272,065 stadii; and from this
to the circle of Mercury, 50,817,165 stadii; and from this to the circle of Mars, 40,541,108
stadii; and from this to the circle of Jupiter, 20,275,065 stadii; and from this to the circle of
Saturn, 40,372,065 stadii; and from this to the Zodiac and the furthest periphery, 20,082,005
stadii.189</p>

the sixth of the aforesaid number, but that the line from the surface of the Earth on which
we tread to the Zodiac would be a sixth of the aforesaid number, less by four myriads of
stadii, which is the distance from the centre of the Earth to its surface. And from the circle

<p>Concerning the Moon, however, a statement has been previously made. The distances
and profundities of the spheres Archimedes thus renders; but a different declaration regarding
them has been made by Hipparchus; and a different one still by Apollonius the mathematician.
It is sufficient, however, for us, following the Platonic opinion, to suppose twofold
and threefold distances from one another of the erratic stars; for the doctrine is thus preserved
of the composition of the universe out of harmony, on concordant principles190 in keeping
with these distances. The numbers, however, advanced by Archimedes,191 and the accounts
rendered by the rest concerning the distances, if they be not on principles of symphony,—that
is, the double and triple (distances) spoken of by Plato,—but are discovered independent
of harmonies, would not preserve the doctrine of the formation of the universe according
to harmony. For it is neither credible nor possible that the distances of these should be both
contrary to some reasonable plan, and independent of harmonious and proportional principles,
except perhaps only the Moon, on account of wanings and the shadow of the Earth,
in regard also of the distance of which alone—that is, the lunar (planet) from earth—one
may trust Archimedes. It will, however, be easy for those who, according to the Platonic
dogma itself, adopt this distance to comprehend by numerical calculation (intervals) according
to what is double and triple, as Plato requires, and the rest of the distances. If, then, according
to Archimedes, the Moon is distant from the surface of the Earth 5,544,130 stadii,
by increasing these numbers double and triple, (it will be) easy to find also the distances of
the rest, as if subtracting one part of the number of stadii which the Moon is distant from
the Earth.</p>
<p>But because the rest of the numbers—those alleged by Archimedes concerning the distance
of the erratic stars—are not based on principles of concord, it is easy to understand—
that is, for those who attend to the matter—how the numbers are mutually related,
and on what principles they depend. That, however, they should not be in harmony and
symphony—I mean those that are parts of the world which consists according to harmony—
this is impossible. Since, therefore, the first number which the Moon is distant from
the earth is 5,544,130, the second number which the Sun is distant from the Moon being
50,272,065, subsists by a greater computation than ninefold. But the higher number in ref-

than half. But the number superior to this, which is 40,541,108, is contained in a less computation
than two-fifths. But the number superior to this, which is 20,275,065, is contained
in a greater computation than half. The final number, however, which is 40,372,065, is
comprised in a less computation than double.</p>

<p>These (numerical) relations, therefore, the greater than ninefold, and less than half, and
greater than double, and less than two-fifths, and greater than half, and less than double,
are beyond all symphonies, from which not any proportionate or harmonic system could
be produced. But the whole world, and the parts of it, are in all respects similarly framed in
conformity with proportion and harmony. The proportionate and harmonic relations,
however, are preserved—as we have previously stated—by double and triple intervals. If,
therefore, we consider Archimedes reliable in the case of only the first distance, that from
the Moon to the Earth, it is easy also to find the rest (of the intervals), by multiplying (them)
by double and treble. Let then the distance, according to Archimedes, from Earth to Moon
be 5,544,130 stadii; there will therefore be the double number of this of stadii which the Sun
is distant from the Moon, viz. 11,088,260. But the Sun is distant from the Earth 16,632,390
stadii; and Venus is likewise distant from the Sun 16,632,390 stadii, but from the Earth
33,264,780 stadii; and Mercury is distant from Venus 22,176,520 stadii, but from Earth
55,441,300 stadii; and Mars is distant from Mercury 49,897,170 stadii, and from Earth
105,338,470 stadii; and Jupiter is distant from Mars 44,353,040 stadii, but from Earth

<p>Certain, adhering partly to these, as if having propounded great conclusions, and supposed
things worthy of reason, have framed enormous and endless heresies; and one of
these is Colarbasus,192 who attempts to explain religion by measures and numbers. And
others there are (who act) in like manner, whose tenets we shall explain when we commence
to speak of what concerns those who give heed to Pythagorean calculation as possible; and
uttering vain prophecies, hastily assume193 as secure the philosophy by numbers and elements.
Now certain (speculators), appropriating194 similar reasonings from these, deceive
unsophisticated individuals, alleging themselves endued with foresight;195 sometimes, after
uttering many predictions, happening on a single fulfilment, and not abashed by many
failures, but making their boast in this one. Neither shall I pass over the witless philosophy
of these men; but, after explaining it, I shall prove that those who attempt to form a system
of religion out of these (aforesaid elements), are disciples of a school196 weak and full of

<head>Chapter XIV.—System of the Arithmeticians; Predictions Through Calculations;
Numerical Roots; Transference of These Doctrines to Letters; Examples in Particular
Names; Different Methods of Calculation; Prescience Possible by These.</head>
<p>Those, then, who suppose that they prophesy by means of calculations and numbers,197
and elements and names, constitute the origin of their attempted system to be as follows.
They affirm that there is a root of each of the numbers; in the case of thousands, so many
monads as there are thousands: for example, the root of six thousand, six monads; of seven
thousand, seven monads; of eight thousand, eight monads; and in the case of the rest, in
like manner, according to the same (proportion). And in the case of hundreds, as many
hundreds as there are, so many monads are the root of them: for instance, of seven hundred
there are seven hundreds; the root of these is seven monads: of six hundred, six hundreds;
the root of these, six monads. And it is similar respecting decades: for of eighty (the root is)
eight monads; and of sixty, six monads; of forty, four monads; of ten, one monad. And in
the case of monads, the monads themselves are a root: for instance, of nine, nine; of eight,
eight; of seven, seven. In this way, also, ought we therefore to act in the case of the elements
(of words), for each letter has been arranged according to a certain number: for instance,
the letter n according to fifty monads; but of fifty monads five is the root, and the root of
the letter n is (therefore) five. Grant that from some name we take certain roots of it. For
instance, (from) the name Agamemnon, there is of the a, one monad; and of the g, three
monads; and of the other a, one monad; of the m, four monads; of the e, five monads; of
the m, four monads; of the n, five monads; of the (long) o, eight monads; of the n, five
monads; which, brought together into one series, will be 1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, 8, 5; and these
added together make up 36 monads. Again, they take the roots of these, and they become
three in the case of the number thirty, but actually six in the case of the number six. The
three and the six, then, added together, constitute nine; but the root of nine is nine: therefore
the name Agamemnon terminates in the root nine.</p>
<p>Let us do the same with another name—Hector. The name (H)ector has five letters—e,
and k, and t, and o, and r. The roots of these are 5, 2, 3, 8, 1; and these added together make
up 19 monads. Again, of the ten the root is one; and of the nine, nine; which added together
make up ten: the root of ten is a monad. The name Hector, therefore, when made the subject
of computation, has formed a root, namely a monad. It would, however, be easier198 to
<note type="footnote">197 The subject of the numerical system employed by the Gnostics, and their occult mysteries, is treated of
by the learned Kircher, OEdipi Ægypt., tom. ii. part i., de Cabalâ Hebræorum; also in his Arithmolog. in the book
De Arithmomantia Gnosticor., cap. viii., de Cabalâ Pythagoreâ. See also Mersennes, Comment. on Genes.</note>
<note type="footnote">198 This subject is examined by Cornelius Agrippa in his celebrated work, De vanitate et incertitudine Scientiarum,
chap. xi., De Sorte Pythagoricâ. Terentius Maurus has also a versified work on Letters and Syllables and
Metres, in which he alludes to similar interpretations educible from the names Hector and Patroclus.</note>

<pb n="74"/>
conduct the calculation thus: Divide the ascertained roots from the letters—as now in the
case of the name Hector we have found nineteen monads—into nine, and treat what remains
over as roots. For example, if I divide 19 into 9, the remainder is 1, for 9 times 2 are 18, and
there is a remaining monad: for if I subtract 18 from 19, there is a remaining monad; so that
the root of the name Hector will be a monad. Again, of the name Patroclus these numbers
are roots: 8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 2, 3, 7, 2; added together, they make up 34 monads. And of these the
remainder is 7 monads: of the 30, 3; and of the 4, 4. Seven monads, therefore, are the root
of the name Patroclus.</p>
<p>Those, then, that conduct their calculations according to the rule of the number nine,199
take the ninth part of the aggregate number of roots, and define what is left over as the sum
of the roots. They, on the other hand, (who conduct their calculations) according to the
rule of the number seven, take the seventh (part of the aggregate number of roots); for example,
in the case of the name Patroclus, the aggregate in the matter of roots is 34 monads.
This divided into seven parts makes four, which (multiplied into each other) are 28. There
are six remaining monads; (so that a person using this method) says, according to the rule
of the number seven, that six monads are the root of the name Patroclus. If, however, it be
43, (six) taken seven times,200 he says, are 42, for seven times six are 42, and one is the remainder.
A monad, therefore, is the root of the number 43, according to the rule of the
number seven. But one ought to observe if the assumed number, when divided, has no remainder;
for example, if from any name, after having added together the roots, I find, to
give an instance, 36 monads. But the number 36 divided into nine makes exactly 4 enneads;
for nine times 4 are 36, and nothing is over. It is evident, then, that the actual root is 9. And
again, dividing the number forty-five, we find nine201 and nothing over—for nine times
five are forty-five, and nothing remains; (wherefore) in the case of such they assert the root
itself to be nine. And as regards the number seven, the case is similar: if, for example we
divide 28 into 7, we have nothing over; for seven times four are 28, and nothing remains;
(wherefore) they say that seven is the root. But when one computes names, and finds the
same letter occurring twice, he calculates it once; for instance, the name Patroclus has the
pa twice,202 and the o twice: they therefore calculate the a once and the o once. According
to this, then, the roots will be 8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 2, 3, 2, and added together they make 27 monads;
<note type="footnote">199 That is, the division by nine.</note>
<note type="footnote">200 That is, calculated according to the rule of a division by seven.</note>
<note type="footnote">201 We should expect rather five instead of 9, if the division be by nine.</note>
<note type="footnote">202 There is some confusion in the text. Miller conjectures that the reading should be: “As, for instance, the
name Patroclus has the letter o occurring twice in it, they therefore take it into calculation once.” Schneidewin
suggests that the form of the name may be Papatroclus.</note>

<pb n="75"/>
and the root of the name will be, according to the rule of the number nine, nine itself, but
according to the rule of the number seven, six.</p>
<p>In like manner, (the name) Sarpedon, when made the subject of calculation, produces
as a root, according to the rule of the number nine, two monads. Patroclus, however, produces
nine monads; Patroclus gains the victory. For when one number is uneven, but the other
even, the uneven number, if it is larger, prevails. But again, when there is an even number,
eight, and five an uneven number, the eight prevails, for it is larger. If, however, there were
two numbers, for example, both of them even, or both of them odd, the smaller prevails.
But how does (the name) Sarpedon, according to the rule of the number nine, make two
monads, since the letter (long) o is omitted? For when there may be in a name the letter
(long) o and (long) e, they leave out the (long) o, using one letter, because they say both are
equipollent; and the same must not be computed twice over, as has been above declared.
Again, (the name) Ajax makes four monads; (but the name) Hector, according to the rule
of the ninth number, makes one monad. And the tetrad is even, whereas the monad odd.
And in the case of such, we say, the greater prevails—Ajax gains the victory. Again, Alexander
and Menelaus (may be adduced as examples). Alexander has a proper name (Paris). But
Paris, according to the rule of the number nine, makes four monads; and Menelaus, according
to the rule of the number nine, makes nine monads. The nine, however, conquer the four
(monads): for it has been declared, when the one number is odd and the other even, the
greater prevails; but when both are even or both odd, the less (prevails). Again, Amycus and
Polydeuces (may be adduced as examples). Amycus, according to the rule of the number
nine, makes two monads, and Polydeuces, however, seven: Polydeuces gains the victory.
Ajax and Ulysses contended at the funeral games. Ajax, according to the rule of the number
nine, makes four monads; Ulysses, according to the rule of the number nine, (makes) eight.203
Is there, then, not any annexed, and (is there) not a proper name for Ulysses?204 for he has
gained the victory. According to the numbers, no doubt, Ajax is victorious, but history
hands down the name of Ulysses as the conqueror. Achilles and Hector (may be adduced
as examples). Achilles, according to the rule of the number nine, makes four monads; Hector
one: Achilles gains the victory. Again, Achilles and Asteropæus (are instances). Achilles
makes four monads, Asteropæus three: Achilles conquers. Again, Menelaus and Euphorbus
(may be adduced as examples). Menelaus has nine monads, Euphorbus eight: Menelaus
gains the victory.</p>
<p>Some, however, according to the rule of the number seven, employ the vowels only, but
others distinguish by themselves the vowels, and by themselves the semi-vowels, and by
themselves the mutes; and, having formed three orders, they take the roots by themselves

<pb n="76"/>
of the vowels, and by themselves of the semi-vowels, and by themselves of the mutes, and
they compare each apart. Others, however, do not employ even these customary numbers,
but different ones: for instance, as an example, they do not wish to allow that the letter p
has as a root 8 monads, but 5, and that the (letter) x (si) has as a root four monads; and
turning in every direction, they discover nothing sound. When, however, they contend
about the second (letter), from each name they take away the first letter; but when they
contend about the third (letter), they take away two letters of each name, and calculating
the rest, compare them.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—Quibbles of the Numerical Theorists; The Art of the Frontispicists
(Physiognomy); Connection of This Art with Astrology; Type of Those Born

<p>I think that there has been clearly expounded the mind of arithmeticians, who, by means
of numbers and of names, suppose that they interpret life. Now I perceive that these, enjoying
leisure, and being trained in calculation, have been desirous that, through the art205 delivered
to them from childhood, they, acquiring celebrity, should be styled prophets. And they,
measuring the letters up (and) down, have wandered into trifling. For if they fail, they say,
in putting forward the difficulty, Perhaps this name was not a family one, but imposed, as
also lighting in the instance they argue in the case of (the names) Ulysses and Ajax. Who,
taking occasion from this astonishing philosophy, and desirous of being styled “Heresiarch,”
will not be extolled?</p>
<p>But since, also, there is another more profound art among the all-wise speculators of
the Greeks—to whom heretical individuals boast that they attach themselves as disciples,
on account of their employing the opinions of these (ancient philosophers) in reference to
the doctrines attempted (to be established) by themselves, as shall a little afterwards be
proved; but this is an art of divination, by examination of the forehead206 or rather, I should
say, it is madness: yet we shall not be silent as regards this (system). There are some who
ascribe to the stars figures that mould the ideas207 and dispositions of men, assigning the
reason of this to births (that have taken place) under particular stars; they thus express
themselves: Those who208 are born under Aries will be of the following kind: long head,

<head>Chapter XXVIII.233—System of the Magicians; Incantations of Demons; Secret
Magical Rites.</head>
<p>… And (the sorcerer), taking (a paper), directs the inquirer234 to write down with water
whatever questions he may desire to have asked from the demons. Then, folding up the
paper, and delivering it to the attendant, he sends him away to commit it to the flames, that
the ascending smoke may waft the letters to demons. While, however, the attendant is executing
this order, (the sorcerer) first removes equal portions of the paper, and on some
more parts of it he pretends that demons write in Hebrew characters. Then burning an incense
of the Egyptian magicians, termed Cyphi, he takes these (portions of paper) away,
and places them near the incense. But (that paper) which the inquirer happens to have
written (upon), having placed on the coals, he has burned. Then (the sorcerer), appearing
to be borne away under divine influence, (and) hurrying into a corner (of the house), utters
a loud and harsh cry, and unintelligible to all,…and orders all those present to enter, crying
out (at the same time), and invoking Phryn, or some other demon. But after passing into
the house, and when those that were present stood side by side, the sorcerer, flinging the
attendant upon a bed,235 utters to him several words, partly in the Greek, and partly, as it
were, the Hebrew language, (embodying) the customary incantations employed by the magicians.
(The attendant), however, goes away236 to make the inquiry. And within (the house),
into a vessel full of water (the sorcerer) infusing copperas mixture, and melting the drug,
having with it sprinkled the paper that forsooth had (the characters upon it) obliterated, he
forces the latent and concealed letters to come once more into light; and by these he ascertains
what the inquirer has written down. And if one write with copperas mixture likewise, and
having ground a gall nut, use its vapour as a fumigator, the concealed letters would become
plain. And if one write with milk, (and) then scorch the paper, and scraping it, sprinkle and
rub (what is thus scraped off) upon the letters traced with the milk, these will become plain.
And urine likewise, and sauce of brine, and juice of euphorbia, and of a fig, produce a similar
result. But when (the sorcerer) has ascertained the question in this mode, he makes
provision for the manner in which he ought to give the reply. And next he orders those that
are present to enter, holding laurel branches and shaking them, and uttering cries, and in-

voking the demon Phryn. For also it becomes these to invoke him;237 and it is worthy that
they make this request from demons, which they do not wish of themselves to put forward,
having lost their minds. The confused noise, however, and the tumult, prevent them directing
attention to those things which it is supposed (the sorcerer) does in secret. But what these
are, the present is a fair opportunity for us to declare.</p>
<p>Considerable darkness, then, prevails. For the (sorcerer) affirms that it is impossible for
mortal nature to behold divine things, for that to hold converse (with these mysteries) is
sufficient. Making, however, the attendant lie down (upon the couch), head foremost, and
placing by each side two of those little tablets, upon which had been inscribed in, forsooth,
Hebrew characters, as it were names of demons, he says that (a demon) will deposit the rest
in their ears. But this (statement) is requisite, in order that some instrument may be placed
beside the ears of the attendant, by which it is possible that he signify everything which he
chooses. First, however, he produces a sound that the (attendant) youth may be terrified;
and secondly, he makes a humming noise; then, thirdly, he speaks238 through the instrument
what he wishes the youth to say, and remains in expectation of the issue of the affair; next,
he makes those present remain still, and directs the (attendant) to signify, what he has heard
from the demons. But the instrument that is placed beside his ears is a natural instrument,
viz., the windpipe of long-necked cranes, or storks, or swans. And if none of these is at hand,
there are also some different artificial instruments (employed); for certain pipes of brass,
ten in number, (and) fitting into one another, terminating in a narrow point, are adapted
(for the purpose), and through these is spoken into the ear whatsoever the (magician) wishes.
And the youth hearing these (words) with terror as uttered by demons, when ordered, speaks
them out. If any one, however, putting around a stick a moist hide, and having dried it and
drawn it together, close it up, and by removing the rod fashion the hide into the form of a
pipe, he attains a similar end. Should any of these, however, be not at hand, he takes a book,
and, opening it inside, stretches it out as far as he think requisite, (and thus) achieves the
same result.</p>
<p>But if he knows beforehand that one is present who is about to ask a question, he is the
more ready for all (contingencies). If, however, he may also previously ascertain the question,
he writes (it) with the drug, and, as being prepared, he is considered239 more skilful, on account
of having clearly written out what is (about) being asked. If, however, he is ignorant
of the question, he forms conjectures, and puts forth something capable of a doubtful and

varied interpretation, in order that the oracular response, being originally unintelligible,
may serve for numerous purposes, and in the issue of events the prediction may be considered
correspondent with what actually occurs. Next, having filled a vessel with water, he puts
down (into it) the paper, as if uninscribed, at the same time infusing along with it copperas
mixture. For in this way the paper written upon floats240 upwards (to the surface), bearing
the response. Accordingly there ensue frequently to the attendant formidable fancies, for
also he strikes blows plentifully on the terrified (bystanders). For, casting incense into the
fire, he again operates after the following method. Covering a lump of what are called “fossil
salts” with Etruscan wax, and dividing the piece itself of incense into two parts, he throws
in a grain of salt; and again joining (the piece) together, and placing it on the burning coals,
he leaves it there. And when this is consumed, the salts, bounding upwards, create the impression
of, as it were, a strange vision taking place. And the dark-blue dye which has been
deposited in the incense produces a blood-red flame, as we have already declared. But (the
sorcerer) makes a scarlet liquid, by mixing wax with alkanet, and, as I said, depositing the
wax in the incense. And he makes the coals241 be moved, placing underneath powdered
alum; and when this is dissolved and swells up like bubbles, the coals are moved.</p>

and in the act of rubbing is slaughtered, while the head is almost severed from the trunk.
There is, however, a compound of the drug, bryony and salt and squills, made up in equal
parts. In order that the person bringing the drug may escape notice, he carries a box with
two compartments constructed of horn, the visible one of which contains frankincense, but
the secret one (the aforesaid) drug. He, however, likewise insinuates into the ears of the

<p>And if one smear243 the ears of goats over with cerate, they say that they expire a little

of their drawing their breath in an act of respiration. And a ram, they assert, dies,244
if one bends back (its neck)245 opposite the sun. And they accomplish the burning of a
house, by daubing it over with the juice of a certain fish called dactylus. And this effect,
which it has by reason of the sea-water, is very useful. Likewise foam of the ocean is boiled
in an earthen jar along with some sweet ingredients; and if you apply a lighted candle to
this while in a seething state, it catches the fire and is consumed; and (yet though the mixture)
be poured upon the head, it does not burn it at all. If, however, you also smear it over with
heated resin,246 it is consumed far more effectually. But he accomplishes his object better

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Imitations of Thunder, and Other Illusions.</head>
<p>Thunder is produced in many ways; for stones very numerous and unusually large, being
rolled downwards along wooden planks, fall upon plates of brass, and cause a sound similar
to thunder. And also around the thin plank with which carders thicken cloth, they coil a
thin rope; and then drawing away the cord with a whirr, they spin the plank round, and in
its revolution it emits a sound like thunder. These farces, verily, are played off thus.</p>
<p>There are, however, other practices which I shall explain, which those who execute these
ludicrous performances estimate as great exploits. Placing a cauldron full of pitch upon
burning coals, when it boils up, (though) laying their hands down upon it, they are not
burned; nay, even while walking on coals of fire with naked feet, they are not scorched. But
also setting a pyramid of stone on a hearth, (the sorcerer) makes it get on fire, and from the
mouth it disgorges a volume of smoke, and that of a fiery description. Then also putting a
linen cloth upon a pot of water, throwing on (at the same time) a quantity of blazing coals,
(the magician) keeps the linen cloth unconsumed. Creating also darkness in the house, (the
sorcerer) alleges that he can introduce gods or demons; and if any requires him to show
Æsculapius, he uses an invocation couched in the following words:—
<lg>
<l>“The child once slain, again of Phoebus deathless made,</l>
<l>I call to come, and aid my sacrificial rites;</l>
<l>Who, also, once the countless tribes of fleeting dead,</l>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—The Burning Æsculapius; Tricks with Fire.</head>
<p>But after he discontinues uttering these jests, a fiery Æsculapius249 appears upon the
floor. Then, placing in the midst a pot full of water, he invokes all the deities, and they are
present. For any one who is by, glancing into the pot, will behold them all, and Diana leading
on her baying hounds. We shall not, however, shrink from narrating the account (of the
devices) of these men, how they attempt (to accomplish their jugglery). For (the magician)
lays his hand upon the cauldron of pitch,250 which is in, as it were, a boiling state; and
throwing in (at the same time) vinegar and nitre and moist pitch, he kindles a fire beneath
the cauldron. The vinegar, however, being mixed along with the nitre, on receiving a small
accession of heat, moves the pitch, so as to cause bubbles to rise to the surface, and afford
the mere semblance of a seething (pot). The (sorcerer), however, previously washes his
hands frequently in brine; the consequence being, that the contents of the cauldron do not
in any wise, though in reality boiling, burn him very much. But if, having smeared his hands
with a tincture of myrtle251 and nitre and myrrh, along with vinegar, he wash them in brine
frequently, he is not scorched: and he does not burn his feet, provided he smear them with
isinglass and a salamander.</p>
<p>As regards, however, the burning like a taper of the pyramid, though composed of stone,
the cause of this is the following. Chalky earth is fashioned into the shape of a pyramid, but
its colour is that of a milk-white stone, and it is prepared after this fashion. Having anointed
the piece of clay with plenty of oil, and put it upon coals, and baked it, by smearing it afresh,
and scorching it a second and third time, and frequently, (the sorcerer) contrives that it can
be burned, even though he should plunge it in water; for it contains in itself abundance of
oil. The hearth, however, is spontaneously kindled, while the magician pours out252 a libation,
by having lime instead of ashes burning underneath, and refined frankincense and a large
quantity of tow,253 and a bundle254 of anointed tapers and of gall nuts, hollow within, and
supplied with (concealed) fire. And after some delay, (the sorcerer) makes (the pyramid)
emit smoke from the mouth, by both putting fire in the gall nut, and encircling it with tow,
<note type="footnote">249 Marsilius Ficinus (in his Commentary on Plotinus, p. 504 et seq., vol. ii. Creuzer’s edition), who here

power of evoking demons, and that a magician, in the presence of many, had shown to Plotinus his guardian

cauldron, (and) on which he deposits the coals, on account of the underlying brine, would
not be burned; besides, that it has itself been washed in brine, and then smeared with the
white of an egg, along with moist alum. And if, likewise, one mix in these the juice of houseleek
along with vinegar, and for a long time previously smear it (with this preparation), after
being washed in this drug, it continues altogether fire-proof.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—The Illusion of the Sealed Letters; Object in Detailing These
Juggleries.</head>
<p>After, then,255 we have succinctly explained the powers of the secret arts practised
among these (magicians), and have shown their easy plan for the acquisition of knowledge,256
neither are we disposed to be silent on the following point, which is a necessary one,—how
that, loosing the seals, they restore the sealed letters, with the actual seals themselves. Melting
pitch, resin, and sulphur, and moreover asphalt, in equal parts, (and) forming the ointment
into a figure, they keep it by them. When, however, it is time to loose a small tablet, smearing
with oil their tongue, next with the latter anointing the seal, (and) heating the drug with a
moderate fire, (the sorcerers) place it upon the seal; and they leave it there until it has acquired
complete consistence, and they use it in this condition as a seal. But they say, likewise, that
wax itself with fir-wood gum possesses a similar potency, as well as two parts of mastich
with one part of dry asphalt. But sulphur also by itself effects the purpose tolerably well, and
flower of gypsum strained with water, and of gum. Now this (last mixture) certainly answers
most admirably also for sealing molten lead. And that which is accomplished by the Tuscan
wax, and refuse257 of resin, and pitch, and asphalt, and mastich, and powdered spar, all being
boiled together in equal parts, is superior to the rest of the drugs which I have mentioned,
while that which is effected by the gum is not inferior. In this manner, then, also, they attempt
to loose the seals, endeavouring to learn the letters written within.</p>
<p>These contrivances, however, I hesitated to narrate258 in this book, perceiving the danger
lest, perchance, any knavish person, taking occasion (from my account), should attempt (to
practise these juggleries). Solicitude, however, for many young persons, who could be preserved
from such practices, has persuaded me to teach and publish, for security’s sake, (the
foregoing statements). For although one person may make use of these for gaining instruction
in evil, in this way somebody else will, by being instructed (in these practices), be preserved
from them. And the magicians themselves, corrupters of life, will be ashamed in
plying their art. And learning these points that have been previously elucidated259 by us,

of a Magical Invocation.</head>
<p>But neither shall I be silent respecting that piece of knavery of these (sorcerers), which
consists in the divination by means of the cauldron. For, making a closed chamber, and
anointing the ceiling with cyanus for present use,261 they introduce certain vessels of cyanus,
262 and stretch them upwards. The cauldron, however, full of water, is placed in the
middle on the ground; and the reflection of the cyanus falling upon it, presents the appearance
of heaven. But the floor also has a certain concealed aperture, on which the cauldron is laid,
having been (previously, supplied with a bottom of crystal, while itself is composed of
stone.263 Underneath, however, unnoticed (by the spectators), is a compartment, into which
the accomplices, assembling, appear invested with the figures of such gods and demons as
the magician wishes to exhibit. Now the dupe, beholding these, becomes astonished at the
knavery of the magician, and subsequently believes all things that are likely to be stated by
him. But (the sorcerer) produces a burning demon, by tracing on the wall whatever figure
he wishes, and then covertly smearing it with a drug mixed according to this manner, viz.,
of Laconian264 and Zacynthian asphalt,—while next, as if under the influence of prophetic
frenzy, he moves the lamp towards the wall. The drug, however, is burned with considerable
splendour. And that a fiery Hecate seems to career through air, he contrives in the mode
following. Concealing a certain accomplice in a place which he wishes, (and) taking aside
his dupes, he persuades them (to believe himself), alleging that he will exhibit a flaming
demon riding through the air. Now he exhorts them immediately to keep their eyes fixed
until they see the flame in the air, and that (then), veiling themselves, they should fall on
their face until he himself should call them; and after having given them these instructions,
he, on a moonless night, in verses speaks thus:—

<p>And while speaking these words, fire is seen borne through the air; but the (spectators)
being horrified at the strange apparition, (and) covering their eyes, fling themselves
speechless to earth. But the success of the artifice is enhanced by the following contrivance.
The accomplice whom I have spoken of as being concealed, when he hears the incantation
ceasing, holding a kite or hawk enveloped with tow, sets fire to it and releases it. The bird,
however, frightened by the flame, is borne aloft, and makes a (proportionably) quicker flight,
which these deluded persons beholding, conceal themselves, as if they had seen something
divine. The winged creature, however, being whirled round by the fire, is borne whithersoever
chance may have it, and burns now the houses, and now the courtyards. Such is the divination
of the sorcerers.</p>

<p>And they make moon and stars appear on the ceiling after this manner. In the central
part of the ceiling, having fastened a mirror, placing a dish full of water equally (with the
mirror) in the central portion of the floor, and setting in a central place likewise a candle,
emitting a faint light from a higher position than the dish,—in this way, by reflection, (the
magician) causes the moon to appear by the mirror. But frequently, also, they suspend on
high from the ceiling, at a distance, a drum,266 but which, being covered with some garment,
is concealed by the accomplice, in order that (the heavenly body) may not appear before
the (proper) time. And afterwards placing a candle (within the drum), when the magician
gives the signal to the accomplice, he removes so much of the covering as may be sufficient
for effecting an imitation representing the figure of the moon as it is at that particular time.
He smears, however, the luminous parts of the drum with cinnabar and gum;267 and having
pared around the neck and bottom of a flagon268 of glass ready behind, he puts a candle in
it, and places around it some of the requisite contrivances for making the figures shine,
which some one of the accomplices has concealed on high; and on receiving the signal, he
throws down from above the contrivances, so to make the moon appear descending from
the sky.</p>
<p>And the same result is achieved by means of a jar in sylvan localities.269 For it is by
means of a jar that the tricks in a house are performed. For having set up an altar, subsequently
is (placed upon it) the jar, having a lighted lamp; when, however, there are a
greater number of lamps, no such sight is displayed. After then the enchanter invokes the
moon, he orders all the lights to be extinguished, yet that one be left faintly burning; and
then the light, that which streams from the jar, is reflected on the ceiling, and furnishes to
those present a representation of the moon; the mouth of the jar being kept covered for the
time which it would seem to require, in order that the representation of full moon should
be exhibited on the ceiling.</p>

<p>These are the deeds of the magicians,275 and innumerable other such (tricks) there are
which work on the credulity of the dupes, by fair balanced words, and the appearance of
plausible acts. And the heresiarchs, astonished at the art of these (sorcerers), have imitated
them, partly by delivering their doctrines in secrecy and darkness, and partly by advancing
(these tenets) as their own. For this reason, being desirous of warning the multitude, we
have been the more painstaking, in order not to omit any expedient276 practised by the
magicians, for those who may be disposed to be deceived. We have been however drawn,
not unreasonably, into a detail of some of the secret (mysteries) of the sorcerers, which are
not very requisite, to be sure, in reference to the subject taken in hand; yet, for the purpose
of guarding against the villanous and incoherent art of magicians, may be supposed useful.
Since, therefore, as far as delineation is feasible, we have explained the opinions of all
(speculators), exerting especial attention towards the elucidation of the opinions introduced
as novelties by the heresiarchs; (opinions) which, as far as piety is concerned, are futile and
spurious, and which are not, even among themselves, perhaps277 deemed worthy of serious
consideration. (Having pursued this course of inquiry), it seems expedient that, by means

<note type="footnote">275 The word magic, or magician, at its origin, had no sinister meaning, as being the science professed by the
Magi, who were an exclusive religious sect of great antiquity in Persia, universally venerated for their mathematical
skill and erudition generally. It was persons who practised wicked arts, and assumed the name of Magi,
that brought the term into disrepute. The origin of magic has been ascribed to Zoroaster, and once devised, it
made rapid progress; because, as Pliny reminds us, it includes three systems of the greatest influence among
men—(1) the art of medicine, (2) religion, (3) divination. This corresponds with Agrippa’s division of magic
into (1) natural, (2) celestial, (3) ceremonial, or superstitious. This last has been also called “goetic” (full of imposture),
and relates to the invocation of devils. This originated probably in Egypt, and quickly spread all over
the world.</note>

<head>Chapter XLIII.—Recapitulation of Theologies and Cosmogonies; System of the
Persians; Of the Babylonians; The Egyptian Notion of Deity; Their Theology
Based on a Theory of Numbers; Their System of Cosmogony.</head>
<p>Among all those who throughout the earth, as philosophers and theologians, have carried
on investigations, has prevailed diversity of opinion278 concerning the Deity, as to His essence
or nature. For some affirm Him to be fire, and some spirit, and some water, while others
say that He is earth. And each of the elements labours under some deficiency, and one is
worsted by the other. To the wise men of the world, this, however, has occurred, which is
obvious to persons possessing intelligence; (I mean) that, beholding the stupendous works
of creation, they were confused respecting the substance of existing things, supposing that
these were too vast to admit of deriving generation from another, and at the same time
(asserting) that neither the universe itself is God. As far as theology was concerned, they
declared, however, a single cause for things that fall under the cognizance of vision, each
supposing the cause which he adjudged the most reasonable; and so, when gazing on the
objects made by God, and on those which are the most insignificant in comparison with
His overpowering majesty, not, however, being able to extend the mind to the magnitude
of God as He really is, they deified these (works of the external world).</p>
<p>But the Persians,279 supposing that they had penetrated more within the confines of
the truth, asserted that the Deity is luminous, a light contained in air. The Babylonians,
however, affirmed that the Deity is dark, which very opinion also appears the consequence
of the other; for day follows night, and night day. Do not the Egyptians, however,280 who
suppose themselves more ancient than all, speak of the power of the Deity? (This power
they estimate by) calculating these intervals of the parts (of the zodiac; and, as if) by a most
divine inspiration,281 they asserted that the Deity is an indivisible monad, both itself generating
itself, and that out of this were formed all things. For this, say they,282 being unbegotten,
produces the succeeding numbers; for instance, the monad, superadded into itself, generates
the duad; and in like manner, when superadded (into duad, triad, and so forth), produces

have been concerning the speculative systems of these nations.</note>
<note type="footnote">280 This rendering follows Miller’s text. Schneidewin thinks there is a hiatus, which the Abbe Cruice fills up,

than all, have formed their ideas of the power of the Deity by calculations and computing,” etc.</note>

the triad and tetrad, up to the decade, which is the beginning and end of numbers. Wherefore
it is that the first and tenth monad is generated, on account of the decade being equipollent,
and being reckoned for a monad, and (because) this multiplied ten times will become a
hundred, and again becomes a monad, and the hundred multiplied ten times will produce
a thousand, and this will be a monad. In this manner also the thousand multiplied ten times
make up the full sum of a myriad; in like manner will it be a monad. But by a comparison
of indivisible quantities, the kindred numbers of the monad comprehend 3, 5, 7, 9.283</p>
<p>There is also, however, a more natural relation of a different number to the monad, according
to the arrangement of the orbit of six days’ duration,284 (that is), of the duad, according
to the position and division of even numbers. But the kindred number is 4 and 8.
These, however, taking from the monad of the numbers285 an idea of virtue, progressed up
to the four elements; (I allude), of course, to spirit, and fire, and water, and earth. And out
of these having made the world, (God) framed it an ermaphrodite, and allocated two elements
for the upper hemisphere, namely spirit and fire; and this is styled the hemisphere of the
monad, (a hemisphere) beneficent, and ascending, and masculine. For, being composed of
small particles, the monad soars into the most rarified and purest part of the atmosphere;
and the other two elements, earth and water, being more gross, he assigned to the duad;
and this is termed the descending hemisphere, both feminine and mischievous. And likewise,
again, the upper elements themselves, when compared one with another, comprise in one
another both male and female for fruitfulness and increase of the whole creation. And the
fire is masculine, and the spirit feminine. And again the water is masculine, and the earth
feminine. And so from the beginning fire consorted with spirit, and water with earth. For
as the power of spirit is fire, so also that of earth is water;286…and the elements themselves,
when computed and resolved by subtraction of enneads, terminate properly, some of them
in the masculine number, and others of them in the feminine. And, again, the ennead is
subtracted for this cause, because the three hundred and sixty parts of the entire (circle)
consist of enneads, and for this reason the four regions of the world are circumscribed by
ninety perfect parts. And light has been appropriated to the monad, and darkness to the

the monad a numerical symbol, a virtue, have progressed up to the elements.” He makes no attempt at a Latin
version. The Abbe Cruice would suggest the introduction of the word προστεθεῖσαν, on account of the statement
already made, that “the monad, superadded into itself, produces a duad.”</note>

duad, and life to light, according to nature, and death to the duad. And to life (has been
appropriated) justice; and to death, injustice. Wherefore everything generated among masculine
numbers is beneficent, while that (produced) among feminine (numbers) is mischievous.
For instance, they pursue their calculations thus: monad—that we may commence from
this—becomes 361, which (numbers) terminate in a monad by the subtraction of the ennead.
In like manner, reckon thus: Duad becomes 605; take away the enneads, it ends in a duad,
and each reverts into its own peculiar (function).</p>

<p>For the monad, therefore, as being beneficent, they assert that there are consequently287
names ascending, and beneficent, and masculine, and carefully observed, terminating in an
uneven number;288 whereas that those terminating in the even number have been supposed
to be both descending, and feminine and malicious. For they affirm that nature is made up
of contraries, namely bad and good, as right and left, light and darkness, night and day, life
and death. And moreover they make this assertion, that they have calculated the word
“Deity,” (and found that it reverts into a pentad with an ennead subtracted). Now this name
is an even number, and when it is written down (on some material) they attach it to the
body, and accomplish cures289 by it. In this manner, likewise, a certain herb, terminating
in this number, being similarly fastened around (the frame), operates by reason of a similar
calculation of the number. Nay, even a doctor cures sickly people by a similar calculation.
If, however, the calculation is contrary, it does not heal with facility.290 Persons attending
to these numbers reckon as many as are homogeneous according to this principle; some,
however, according to vowels alone; whereas others according to the entire number. Such
also is the wisdom of the Egyptians, by which, as they boast, they suppose that they cognise
the divine nature.</p>

<head>Chapter XLVI.—The Astrotheosophists; Aratus Imitated by the Heresiarchs; His
System of the Disposition of the Stars.</head>
<p>Having sufficiently explained these opinions, let us next pass on to a consideration of
the subject taken in hand, in order that, by proving what we have determined concerning
heresies, and by compelling their (champions) to return to these several (speculators) their
peculiar tenets, we may show the heresiarchs destitute (of a system); and by proclaiming
the folly of those who are persuaded (by these heterodox tenets), we shall prevail on them
to retrace their course to the serene haven of the truth. In order, however, that the statements
about to follow may seem more clear to the readers, it is expedient also to declare the opinions
advanced by Aratus concerning the disposition of the stars of the heavens. (And this is necessary),
inasmuch as some persons, assimilating these (doctrines) to those declared by the
Scriptures, convert (the holy writings) into allegories, and endeavour to seduce the mind
of those who give heed to their (tenets), drawing them on by plausible words into the admission
of whatever opinions they wish, (and) exhibiting a strange marvel, as if the assertions
made by them were fixed among the stars. They, however, gazing intently on the very extraordinary
wonder, admirers as they are of trifles, are fascinated like a bird called the owl,
which example it is proper to mention, on account of the statements that are about to follow.
The animal (I speak of) is, however, not very different from an eagle, either in size or figure,
and it is captured in the following way:—The hunter of these birds, when he sees a flock of
them lighting anywhere, shaking his hands, at a distance pretends to dance, and so by little
and little draws near the birds. But they, struck with amazement at the strange sight, are
rendered unobservant of everything passing around them. But others of the party, who have
come into the country equipped for such a purpose, coming from behind upon the birds,
easily lay hold on them as they are gazing on the dancer.</p>
<p>Wherefore I desire that no one, astonished by similar wonders of those who interpret
the (aspect of) heaven, should, like the owl, be taken captive. For the knavery practised by
such speculators may be considered dancing and silliness, but not truth. Aratus,291 therefore,
expresses himself thus:—
<lg>
<l>“Just as many are they; hither and thither they roll</l>
<l>Day by day o’er heav’n, endless, ever, (that is, every star),</l>
<l>Yet this declines not even little; but thus exactly</l>
<l>E’er remains with axis fixed and poised in every part</l>
<l>Holds earth midway, and heaven itself around conducts.”</l>

<head>Chapter XLVII.—Opinions of the Heretics Borrowed from Aratus.</head>
<p>Aratus says that there are in the sky revolving, that is, gyrating stars, because from east
to west, and west to east, they journey perpetually, (and) in an orbicular figure. And he says
that there revolves towards292 “The Bears” themselves, like some stream of a river, an
enormous and prodigious monster, (the) Serpent; and that this is what the devil says in the
book of Job to the Deity, when (Satan) uses these words: “I have traversed earth under
heaven, and have gone around (it),”293 that is, that I have been turned around, and thereby
have been able to survey the worlds. For they suppose that towards the North Pole is situated
the Dragon, the Serpent, from the highest pole looking upon all (the objects), and gazing
on all the works of creation, in order that nothing of the things that are being made may
escape his notice. For though all the stars in the firmament set, the pole of this (luminary)
alone never sets, but, careering high above the horizon, surveys and beholds all things, and
none of the works of creation, he says, can escape his notice.</p>
<p>“Where chiefly</p>
<p>Settings mingle and risings one with other.”294</p>
<p>(Here Aratus) says that the head of this (constellation) is placed. For towards the west
and east of the two hemispheres is situated the head of the Dragon, in order, he says, that
nothing may escape his notice throughout the same quarter, either of objects in the west or
those in the east, but that the Beast may know all things at the same time. And near the head
itself of the Dragon is the appearance of a man, conspicuous by means of the stars, which
Aratus styles a wearied image, and like one oppressed with labour, and he is denominated
“Engonasis.” Aratus295 then affirms that he does not know what this toil is, and what this
prodigy is that revolves in heaven. The heretics, however, wishing by means of this account
of the stars to establish their own doctrines, (and) with more than ordinary earnestness devoting
their attention to these (astronomic systems), assert that Engonasis is Adam, according
to the commandment of God as Moses declared, guarding the head of the Dragon, and the
Dragon (guarding) his heel. For so Aratus expresses himself:—

<p>And (Aratus) says that (the constellations) Lyra and Corona have been placed on both
sides near him,—now I mean Engonasis,—but that he bends the knee, and stretches forth
both hands, as if making a confession of sin. And that the lyre is a musical instrument
fashioned by Logos while still altogether an infant, and that Logos is the same as he who is
denominated Mercury among the Greeks. And Aratus, with regard to the construction of
the lyre, observes:—
<lg>
<l>“Then, further, also near the cradle,297</l>
<l>Hermes pierced it through, and said, Call it Lyre.”298</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>It consists of seven strings, signifying by these seven strings the entire harmony and
construction of the world as it is melodiously constituted. For in six days the world was
made, and (the Creator) rested on the seventh. If, then, says (Aratus), Adam, acknowledging
(his guilt) and guarding the head of the Beast, according to the commandment of the Deity,
will imitate Lyra, that is, obey the Logos of God, that is, submit to the law, he will receive
Corona that is situated near him. If, however, he neglect his duty, he shall be hurled downwards
in company with the Beast that lies underneath, and shall have, he says, his portion
with the Beast. And Engonasis seems on both sides to extend his hands, and on one to touch
Lyra, and on the other Corona—and this is his confession;—so that it is possible to distinguish
him by means of this (sidereal) configuration itself. But Corona nevertheless is plotted
against, and forcibly drawn away by another beast, a smaller Dragon, which is the offspring
of him who is guarded by the foot299 of Engonasis. A man also stands firmly grasping with
both hands, and dragging towards the space behind the Serpent from Corona; and he does
not permit the Beast to touch Corona. though making a violent effort to do so. And Aratus
styles him Anguitenens, because he restrains the impetuosity of the Serpent in his attempt
to reach Corona. But Logos, he says, is he who, in the figure of a man, hinders the Beast

The Latin version in Buhle’s edition of Aratus is ad cunam (cunabulam) compegit, i.e., he fastened the strings
into the shell of the tortoise near his bed. The tortoise is mentioned by Aratus in the first part of the line, which
fact removes the obscurity of the passage as quoted by Hippolytus. The general tradition corresponds with this,
in representing Mercury on the shores of the Nile forming a lyre out of a dried tortoise. The word translated
bed might be also rendered fan, which was used as a cradle, its size and construction being suitable. [See note,

from reaching Corona, commiserating him who is being plotted against by the Dragon and
his offspring simultaneously.</p>
<p>These (constellations), “The Bears,” however, he says, are two hebdomads, composed
of seven stars, images of two creations. For the first creation, he affirms, is that according
to Adam in labours, this is he who is seen “on his knees” (Engonasis). The second creation,
however, is that according to Christ, by which we are regenerated; and this is Anguitenens,
who struggles against the Beast, and hinders him from reaching Corona, which is reserved
for the man. But “The Great Bear” is, he says, Helice,300 symbol of a mighty world towards
which the Greeks steer their course, that is, for which they are being disciplined. And, wafted
by the waves of life, they follow onwards, (having in prospect) some such revolving world
or discipline or wisdom which conducts those back that follow in pursuit of such a world.
For the term Helice seems to signify a certain circling and revolution towards the same
points. There is likewise a certain other “Small Bear” (Cynosuris), as it were some image of
the second creation—that formed according to God. For few, he says, there are that journey
by the narrow path.301 But they assert that Cynosuris is narrow, towards which Aratus302
says that the Sidonians navigate. But Aratus has spoken partly of the Sidonians, (but means)
the Phoenicians, on account of the existence of the admirable wisdom of the Phoenicians.
The Greeks, however, assert that they are Phoenicians, who have migrated from (the shores
of) the Red Sea into this country where they even at present dwell, for this is the opinion of
Herodotus.303 Now Cynosura, he says, is this (lesser) Bear, the second creation; the one of
limited dimensions, the narrow way, and not Helice. For he does not lead them back, but
guides forward by a straight path, those that follow him being (the tail) of Canis. For Canis
is the Logos,304 partly guarding and preserving the flock, that is plotted against by the wolves;
and partly like a dog, hunting the beasts from the creation, and destroying them; and partly
producing all things, and being what they express by the name “Cyon” (Canis), that is,
generator. Hence it is said, Aratus has spoken of the rising of Canis, expressing himself thus:
“When, however, Canis has risen, no longer do the crops miss.” This is what he says: Plants
that have been put into the earth up to the period of Canis’ rising, frequently, though not
having struck root, are yet covered with a profusion of leaves, and afford indications to
<note type="footnote">300 The Abbe Cruice considers that these interpretations, as well as what follows, are taken not from a Greek
writer, but a Jewish heretic. No Greek, he supposes, would write, as is stated lower down, that the Greeks were
a Phoenician colony. The Jewish heresies were impregnated by these silly doctrines about the stars (see Epiphan.,

spectators that they will be productive, and that they appear full of life, (though in reality)
not having vitality in themselves from the root. But when the rising of Canis takes place,
the living are separated from the dead by Canis; for whatsoever plants have not taken root,
really undergo putrefaction. This Canis, therefore, he says, as being a certain divine Logos,
has been appointed judge of quick and dead. And as (the influence of) Canis is observable
in the vegetable productions of this world, so in plants of celestial growth—in men—is beheld
the (power of the) Logos. From some such cause, then, Cynosura, the second creation, is
set in the firmament as an image of a creation by the Logos. The Dragon, however, in the
centre reclines between the two creations, preventing a transition of whatever things are
from the great creation to the small creation; and in guarding those that are fixed in the
(great) creation, as for instance Engonasis, observing (at the same time) how and in what
manner each is constituted in the small creation. And (the Dragon) himself is watched at
the head, he says, by Anguitenens. This image, he affirms, is fixed in heaven, being a certain
wisdom to those capable of discerning it. If, however, this is obscure, by means of some
other image, he says the creation teaches (men) to philosophize, in regard to which Aratus
has expressed himself thus:—

<p>But Aratus says, near this (constellation) is Cepheus, and Cassiepea, and Andromeda,
and Perseus, great lineaments of the creation to those who are able to discern them. For he
asserts that Cepheus is Adam, Cassiepea Eve, Andromeda the soul of both of these, Perseus
the Logos, winged offspring of Jove, and Cetos306 the plotting monster. Not to any of these,
but to Andromeda only does he repair, who slays the Beast; from whom, likewise taking
unto himself Andromeda, who had been delivered (and) chained to the Beast, the Logos—that
is, Perseus—achieves, he says, her liberation. Perseus, however, is the winged axle that pierces
both poles through the centre of the earth, and turns the world round. The spirit also, that
which is in the world, is (symbolized by) Cycnus, a bird—a musical animal near “The
Bears”—type of the Divine Spirit, because that when it approaches the end itself of life,307
it alone is fitted by nature to sing, on departing with good hope from the wicked creation,
(and) offering up hymns unto God. But crabs, and bulls, and lions, and rams, and goats,
and kids, and as many other beasts as have their names used for denominating the stars in
the firmament, are, he says, images, and exemplars from which the creation, subject to
change, obtaining (the different) species, becomes replete with animals of this description.</p>

or Cepheus, or Andromeda, or the spectres that have names given them in Hades, have the
stars that are scattered over the firmament—for we must remember that these men, and the
titles themselves, came into existence long after the origin of man,—(what, I say, is in common

<head>Chapter LI.—The Hebdomadarii; System of the Arithmeticians; Pressed into the
Service of Heresy; Instances Of, in Simon and Valentinus; The Nature of the
Universe Deducible from the Physiology of the Brain.</head>
<p>But since almost every heresy (that has sprung up) through the arithmetical art has
discovered measures of hebdomads and certain projections of Æons, each rending the art
differently, while whatever variation prevailed was in the names merely; and (since) Pythagoras
became the instructor of these, first introducing numbers of this sort among the
Greeks from Egypt, it seems expedient not to omit even this, but, after we have given a
compendious elucidation, to approach the demonstration of those things that we propose
to investigate.</p>
<p>Arithmeticians and geometers arose, to whom especially Pythagoras first seems to have
furnished principles. And from numbers that can continually progress ad infinitum by
multiplication, and from figures, these derived their first principles,308 as capable of being
discerned by reason alone; for a principle of geometry, as one may perceive, is an indivisible
point. From that point, however, by means of the art, the generation of endless figures from
the point is discovered. For the point being drawn into length becomes a line, after being
thus continued, having a point for its extremity. And a line flowing out into breadth begets
a surface, and the limits of the surface are lines; but a surface flowing out into breadth becomes
body. And when what is solid has in this manner derived existence from, altogether,
the smallest point, the nature of a huge body is constituted; and this is what Simon expresses
thus: “The little will be great, being as a point, and the great illimitable.” Now this coincides
with the geometrical doctrine of a point.</p>
<p>But of the arithmetical309 art, which by composition contains philosophy, number became
a first principle, which is an indefinable and incomprehensible (entity), comprising
in itself all the numbers that can go on ad infinitum by aggregation. But the first monad
became a principle, according to substance, of the numbers, which (principle) is a male310
monad, pro-creating paternally all the rest of the numbers. Secondly, the duad is a female
number, which by the arithmeticians is also itself denominated even. Thirdly, the triad is a
male number; this also it has been the usual custom of arithmeticians to style odd. In addition
to all these, the tetrad is a female number; and this same, because it is feminine, is likewise
denominated even. All the numbers therefore, taken generically, are four—number, however,
as regards genus, is indefinite—from which, according to their system, is formed the perfect
number—I mean the decade. For one, two, three, four, become ten—as has been previously
proved—if the proper denomination be preserved, according to substance, for each of the

<note type="footnote">310 Some read ἄρσις.</note>

<pb n="124"/>
numbers. This is the sacred quaternion, according to Pythagoras, having in itself roots of
an endless nature, that is, all other numbers; for eleven, and twelve, and the rest, derive the
principle of generation from the ten. Of this decade—the perfect number—there are called
four parts—number, monad, power, cube—whose connections and mixtures take place for
the generation of increase, according to nature completing the productive number. For
when the square is multiplied into itself, it becomes a biquadratic; but when the square is
multiplied into a cube, it becomes the product of a quadratic and cube; but when a cube is
multiplied into a cube, it becomes the product of cube multiplied by cube. Wherefore all
the numbers are seven; so that the generation of things produced may be from the hebdomad—
which is number, monad, power, cube, biquadratic, product of quadratic multiplied
by cube, product of cube multiplied by cube.</p>
<p>Of this hebdomad Simon and Valentinus, having altered the names, detailed marvellous
stories, from thence hastily adopting a system for themselves. For Simon employs his denominations
thus: Mind, Intelligence, Name, Voice, Ratiocination, Reflection; and He who
stood, stands, will stand. And Valentinus (enumerates them thus): Mind, Truth, Word, Life,
Man, Church, and the Father, reckoned along with these, according to the same principles
as those advanced by the cultivators of arithmetical philosophy. And (heresiarchs) admiring,
as if unknown to the multitude, (this philosophy, and) following it, have framed heterodox
doctrines devised by themselves.</p>
<p>Some indeed, then, attempt likewise to form the hebdomads from the medical311 (art),
being astonished at the dissection of the brain, asserting that the substance of the universe
and the power of procreation and the Godhead could be ascertained from the arrangement
of the brain. For the brain, being the dominant portion of the entire body, reposes calm and
unmoved, containing within itself the spirit. Such an account, then, is not incredible, but
widely differs from the conclusions which these (heretics) attempt to deduce from it. For
the brain, on being dissected, has within it what may be called a vaulted chamber. And on
either side of this are thin membranes, which they term little wings. Now these are gently
moved by the spirit, and in turn propel towards the cerebellum the spirit, which, careering
through a certain blood-vessel like a reed, advances towards the pineal gland. And near this
is situated the entrance of the cerebellum, which admits the current of spirit, and distributes
it into what is styled the spinal marrow. But from them the whole frame participates in the
spiritual energy, inasmuch as all the arteries, like a branch, are fastened on from this bloodvessel,
the extremity of which terminates in the genital blood-vessels, whence all the (animal)
seeds proceeding from the brain through the loin are secreted (in the seminal glands). The
<note type="footnote">311 The Abbe Cruice refers to Censorinus (De Die Natali, cap. vii. et xiv.), who mentions that two numbers
were held in veneration, the seventh (hebdomad) and ninth (ennead). The former was of use in curing corporeal
disease, and ascribed to Apollo; the latter healed the diseases of the mind, and was attributed to the Muses.</note>

<pb n="125"/>
form, however, of the brain is like the head of a serpent, respecting which a lengthened
discussion is maintained by the professors of knowledge, falsely so named, as we shall prove.
Six other coupling ligaments grow out of the brain, which, traversing round the head, and
having their termination in (the head) itself, hold bodies together; but the seventh (ligament)
proceeds from the cerebellum to the lower parts of the rest of the frame, as we have declared.</p>
<p>And respecting this there is an enlarged discussion, whence both Simon and Valentinus
will be found both to have derived from this source starting-points for their opinions, and,
though they may not acknowledge it, to be in the first instance liars, then heretics. Since,
then, it appears that we have sufficiently explained these tenets likewise, and that all the reputed
opinions of this earthly philosophy have been comprised in four books; it seems expedient
to proceed to a consideration of the disciples of these men, nay rather, those who
have furtively appropriated their doctrines.312</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Recapitulation; Characteristics of Heresy; Origin of the Name Naasseni;</head>
<p>The System of the Naasseni.
I think that in the four preceding books I have very elaborately explained the opinions
propounded by all the speculators among both Greeks and Barbarians, respecting the Divine
Nature and the creation of the world; and not even have I omitted316 the consideration of
their systems of magic. So that I have for my readers undergone no ordinary amount of toil,
in my anxiety to urge many forward into a desire of learning, and into stedfastness of
knowledge in regard of the truth. It remains, therefore, to hasten on to the refutation of the
heresies; but it is for the purpose of furnishing this (refutation) that we have put forward
the statements already made by us. For from philosophers the heresiarchs deriving317
starting-points, (and) like cobblers patching together, according to their own particular interpretation,
the blunders of the ancients, have advanced them as novelties to those that are
capable of being deceived, as we shall prove in the following books. In the remainder (of
our work), the opportunity invites us to approach the treatment of our proposed subjects,
and to begin from those who have presumed to celebrate a serpent,318 the originator of the
error (in question), through certain expressions devised by the energy of his own (ingenuity).
The priests, then, and champions of the system, have been first those who have been called
Naasseni,319 being so denominated from the Hebrew language, for the serpent is called
naas320 (in Hebrew). Subsequently, however, they have styled themselves Gnostics, alleging
that they alone have sounded the depths of knowledge. Now, from the system of these
(speculators), many, detaching parts, have constructed a heresy which, though with several
subdivisions, is essentially one, and they explain precisely the same (tenets); though conveyed

some other word, as thus: “not even have I failed to disclose.” Schneidewin’s correction of ἀποκαλύψας into

<note type="footnote">320 The Hebrew word is נָחָש (nachash).</note>

<pb n="129"/>
under the guise of different opinions, as the following discussion, according as it progresses,
will prove.</p>
<p>These (Naasseni), then, according to the system321 advanced by them, magnify, (as the
originating cause) of all things else, a man and a son of man. And this man is a hermaphrodite,
and is denominated among them Adam; and hymns many and various are made to
him. The hymns322 however—to be brief—are couched among them in some such form as
this: “From thee (comes) father, and through thee (comes) mother, two names immortal,
progenitors of Æons, O denizen of heaven, thou illustrious man.” But they divide him as
Geryon323 into three parts. For, say they, of this man one part is rational, another psychical,
another earthly. And they suppose that the knowledge of him is the originating principle
of the capacity for a knowledge of God, expressing themselves thus: “The originating principle
of perfection is the knowledge324 of man, while the knowledge of God is absolute perfection.”
All these qualities, however—rational, and psychical, and earthly—have, (the Naassene)
says, retired and descended into one man simultaneously—Jesus,325 who was born of Mary.
And these three men (the Naassene) says, are in the habit of speaking (through Jesus) at the
same time together, each from their own proper substances to those peculiarly their own.
For, according to these, there are three kinds of all existent things—angelic, psychical, earthly;
and there are three churches—angelic, psychical, earthly; and the names of these are elect,
called, captive.</p>
<note type="footnote">321 παρὰ τὸν αὐτῶν λόγον. Bernaysius suggests for these words, πατέρα τῷ αὐτῷ λόγῳ. Schneidewin regards
the emendation as an error, and Bunsen partly so. The latter would read, πατέρα τὸν αὐτῶν Λόγον, i.e., “The
Naasseni honour the Father of all existent things, the Logos, as man and the Son of Man.”</note>

all correct philosophy. In this and other instances it will be found that the system, however wild and incoherent
in its theology, of the Naaseni and of some of the other Gnostic sects, was one which was constructed by a subtle
analysis of thought, and by observation of nature.</note>
<note type="footnote">325 The Abbe Cruice remarks on this passage, that, as the statement here as regards Jesus Christ does not
correspond with Origen’s remarks on the opinions of the Naasseni in reference to our Lord, the Philosophumena

<head>Chapter II.—Naasseni Ascribe Their System, Through Mariamne, to James the
Lord’s Brother; Really Traceable to the Ancient Mysteries; Their Psychology as
Given in the “Gospel According to Thomas;” Assyrian Theory of the Soul; The
Systems of the Naasseni and the Assyrians Compared; Support Drawn by the
Naasseni from the Phrygian and Egyptian Mysteries; The Mysteries of Isis; These
Mysteries Allegorized by the Naasseni.</head>
<p>These are the heads of very numerous discourses which (the Naassene) asserts James
the brother of the Lord handed down to Mariamne.326 In order, then, that these impious
(heretics) may no longer belie Mariamne or James, or the Saviour Himself, let us come to
the mystic rites (whence these have derived their figment),—to a consideration, if it seems
right, of both the Barbarian and Grecian (mysteries),—and let us see how these (heretics),
collecting together the secret and ineffable mysteries of all the Gentiles, are uttering falsehoods
against Christ, and are making dupes of those who are not acquainted with these orgies of
the Gentiles. For since the foundation of the doctrine with them is the man Adam, and they
say that concerning him it has been written, “Who shall declare his generation?”327 learn
how, partly deriving from the Gentiles the undiscoverable and diversified328 generation of
the man, they fictitiously apply it to Christ.</p>
<p>“Now earth,”329 say the Greeks, “gave forth a man, (earth) first bearing a goodly gift,
wishing to become mother not of plants devoid of sense, nor beasts without reason, but of
a gentle and highly favoured creature.” “It, however, is difficult,” (the Naassene) says, “to
ascertain whether Alalcomeneus,330 first of men, rose upon the Boeotians over Lake Cephisus;
or whether it were the Idæan Curetes, a divine race; or the Phrygian Corybantes, whom first
the sun beheld springing up after the manner of the growth of trees; or whether Arcadia
brought forth Pelasgus, of greater antiquity than the moon; or Eleusis (produced) Diaulus,

Origen, who in his Contra Celsum mentions Mariamne, but professes not to have met with any of his followers

Iarbas, first born, on emerging from arid plains, commenced eating the sweet acorn of
Jupiter. But the Nile of the Egyptians,” he says, “up to this day fertilizing mud, (and therefore)

Assyrians, however, say that fish-eating Oannes331 was (the first man, and) produced among
themselves. The Chaldeans, however, say that this Adam is the man whom alone earth
brought forth. And that he lay inanimate, unmoved, (and) still as a statue; being an image
of him who is above, who is celebrated as the man Adam,332 having been begotten by many
powers, concerning whom individually is an enlarged discussion.</p>
<p>In order, therefore, that finally the Great Man from above may be overpowered, “from
whom,” as they say, “the whole family named on earth and in the heavens has been formed,
to him was given also a soul, that through the soul he might suffer; and that the enslaved
image may be punished of the Great and most Glorious and Perfect Man, for even so they
call him. Again, then, they ask what is the soul, and whence, and what kind in its nature,
that, coming to the man and moving him,333 it should enslave and punish the image of the
Perfect Man. They do not, however, (on this point) institute an inquiry from the Scriptures,
but ask this (question) also from the mystic (rites). And they affirm that the soul is very
difficult to discover, and hard to understand; for it does not remain in the same figure or
the same form invariably, or in one passive condition, that either one could express it by a
sign, or comprehend it substantially.</p>
<p>But they have these varied changes (of the soul) set down in the gospel inscribed “according
to the Egyptians.”334 They are, then, in doubt, as all the rest of men among the
Gentiles, whether (the soul) is at all from something pre-existent, or whether from the self-

respecting the perfection of Adam. Thus Gerson, in his Commentary on Abarbanel, says that “Adam was endued
with the very perfection of wisdom, and was chief of philosophers, that he was an immediate disciple of the
Deity, also a physician and astrologer, and the originator of all the arts and sciences.” This spirit of exaggeration
passed from the Jews to the Christians (see Clementine Homilies, ii.). Aquinas (Sum. Theol., pars i. 94) says of
Adam, “Since the first man was appointed perfect, he ought to have possessed a knowledge of everything capable
of being ascertained by natural means.”</note>

produced (one),335 or from a widespread Chaos. And first they fly for refuge to the mysteries
of the Assyrians, perceiving the threefold division of the man; for the Assyrians first advanced
the opinion that the soul has three parts, and yet (is essentially) one. For of soul, say they,
is every nature desirous, and each in a different manner. For soul is cause of all things made;
all things that are nourished, (the Naassene) says, and that grow, require soul. For it is not
possible, he says, to obtain any nourishment or growth where soul is not present. For even
stones, he affirms, are animated, for they possess what is capable of increase; but increase
would not at any time take place without nourishment, for it is by accession that things
which are being increased grow, but accession is the nourishment of things that are nurtured.
Every nature, then, (the Naasene) says, of things celestial, and earthly, and infernal, desires
a soul. And an entity of this description the Assyrians call Adonis or Endymion;336 and
when it is styled Adonis, Venus, he says, loves and desires the soul when styled by such a
name. But Venus is production, according to them. But whenever Proserpine or Cora becomes
enamoured with Adonis, there results, he says, a certain mortal soul separated from
Venus (that is, from generation). But should the Moon pass into concupiscence for Endymion,
and into love of her form, the nature,337 he says, of the higher beings requires a soul
likewise. But if, he says, the mother of the gods emasculate Attis,338 and herself has this
(person) as an object of affection, the blessed nature, he says, of the supernal and everlasting
(beings) alone recalls the male power of the soul to itself.</p>
<p>For (the Naassene) says, there is the hermaphrodite man. According to this account of
theirs, the intercourse of woman with man is demonstrated, in conformity with such
teaching, to be an exceedingly wicked and filthy (practice).339 For, says (the Naassene), Attis
has been emasculated, that is, he has passed over from the earthly parts of the nether world
to the everlasting substance above, where, he says, there is neither female or male,340 but a
new creature,341 a new man, which is hermaphrodite. As to where, however, they use the
expression “above,” I shall show when I come to the proper place (for treating this subject).
But they assert that, by their account, they testify that Rhea is not absolutely isolated, but—for

so I may say—the universal creature; and this they declare to be what is affirmed by the
Word. “For the invisible things of Him are seen from the creation of the world, being understood
by the things that are made by Him, even His eternal power and Godhead, for the
purpose of leaving them without excuse. Wherefore, knowing God, they glorified Him not
as God, nor gave Him thanks; but their foolish heart was rendered vain. For, professing
themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God
into images of the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and
creeping things. Wherefore also God gave them up unto vile affections; for even their women
did change the natural use into that which is against nature.” What, however, the natural
use is, according to them, we shall afterwards declare. “And likewise also the men, leaving
the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men
working that which is unseemly”—now the expression that which is unseemly signifies,
according to these (Naasseni), the first and blessed substance, figureless, the cause of all
figures to those things that are moulded into shapes,—“and receiving in themselves that
recompense of their error which was meet.”342 For in these words which Paul has spoken
they say the entire secret of theirs, and a hidden mystery of blessed pleasure, are comprised.
For the promise of washing is not any other, according to them, than the introduction of
him that is washed in, according to them, life-giving water, and anointed with ineffable343
ointment (than his introduction) into unfading bliss.</p>
<p>But they assert that not only is there in favour of their doctrine, testimony to be drawn
from the mysteries of the Assyrians, but also from those of the Phrygians concerning the
happy nature—concealed, and yet at the same time disclosed—of things that have been, and
are coming into existence, and moreover will be,—(a happy nature) which, (the Naassene)
says, is the kingdom of heaven to be sought for within a man.344 And concerning this
(nature) they hand down an explicit passage, occurring345 in the Gospel inscribed according
to Thomas,346 expressing themselves thus: “He who seeks me, will find me in children from
seven years old; for there concealed, I shall in the fourteenth age be made manifest.” This,

however, is not (the teaching) of Christ, but of Hippocrates, who uses these words: “A child
of seven years is half of a father.” And so it is that these (heretics), placing the originative
nature of the universe in causative seed, (and) having ascertained the (aphorism) of Hippocrates,
347 that a child of seven years old is half of a father, say that in fourteen years, according
to Thomas, he is manifested. This, with them, is the ineffable and mystical Logos. They assert,
then, that the Egyptians, who after the Phrygians,348 it is established, are of greater antiquity
than all mankind, and who confessedly were the first to proclaim to all the rest of men the
rites and orgies of, at the same time, all the gods, as well as the species and energies (of
things), have the sacred and august, and for those who are not initiated, unspeakable mysteries
of Isis. These, however, are not anything else than what by her of the seven dresses
and sable robe was sought and snatched away, namely, the pudendum of Osiris. And they
say that Osiris is water.349 But the seven-robed nature, encircled and arrayed with seven
mantles of ethereal texture—for so they call the planetary stars, allegorizing and denominating
them ethereal350 robes,—is as it were the changeable generation, and is exhibited as
the creature transformed by the ineffable and unportrayable,351 and inconceivable and figureless
one. And this, (the Naassene) says, is what is declared in Scripture, “The just will
fall seven times, and rise again.”352 For these falls, he says, are the changes of the stars,
moved by Him who puts all things in motion.</p>
<p>They affirm, then, concerning the substance353 of the seed which is a cause of all existent
things, that it is none of these, but that it produces and forms all things that are made, expressing
themselves thus: “I become what I wish, and I am what I am: on account of this I
say, that what puts all things in motion is itself unmoved. For what exists remains forming
all things, and nought of existing things is made.”354 He says that this (one) alone is good,
and that what is spoken by the Saviour355 is declared concerning this (one): “Why do you
say that am good? One is good, my Father which is in the heavens, who causeth His sun to
rise upon the just and unjust, and sendeth rain upon saints and sinners.”356 But who the
saintly ones are on whom He sends the rain, and the sinners on whom the same sends the

rain, this likewise we shall afterwards declare with the rest. And this is the great and secret
and unknown mystery of the universe, concealed and revealed among the Egyptians. For
Osiris,357 (the Naassene) says, is in temples in front of Isis;358 and his pudendum stands
exposed, looking downwards, and crowned with all its own fruits of things that are made.
And (he affirms) that such stands not only in the most hallowed temples chief of idols, but
that also, for the information of all, it is as it were a light not set under a bushel, but upon
a candlestick, proclaiming its message upon the housetops,359 in all byways, and all streets,
and near the actual dwellings, placed in front as a certain appointed limit and termination
of the dwelling, and that this is denominated the good (entity) by all. For they style this
good-producing, not knowing what they say. And the Greeks, deriving this mystical (expression)
from the Egyptians, preserve it until this day. For we behold, says (the Naassene),
statues of Mercury, of such a figure honoured among them.</p>
<p>Worshipping, however, Cyllenius with especial distinction, they style him Logios. For
Mercury is Logos, who being interpreter and fabricator of the things that have been made
simultaneously, and that are being produced, and that will exist, stands honoured among
them, fashioned into some such figure as is the pudendum of a man, having an impulsive
power from the parts below towards those above. And that this (deity)—that is, a Mercury
of this description—is, (the Naassene) says, a conjurer of the dead, and a guide of departed
spirits, and an originator of souls; nor does this escape the notice of the poets, who express
themselves thus:—
<lg>
<l>“Cyllenian Hermes also called</l>
<l>The souls of mortal suitors.”360</l>
<l>Not Penelope’s suitors, says he, O wretches! but (souls) awakened and brought to recollection
of themselves,</l>
<l>“From honour so great, and from bliss so long.”361</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>That is, from the blessed man from above, or the primal man or Adam, as it seems to
them, souls have been conveyed down here into a creation of clay, that they may serve the
Demiurge of this creation, Ialdabaoth,362 a fiery God, a fourth number; for so they call the
Demiurge and father of the formal world:—

<l>“And in hand he held a lovely</l>
<l>Wand of gold that human eyes enchants,</l>
<l>Of whom he will, and those again who slumber rouses.”363</l>
</lg>
</p>

<p>This, he says, is he who alone has power of life and death. Concerning this, he says, it
has been written, “Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron.”364 The poet, however, he says,
being desirous of adorning the incomprehensible (potency) of the blessed nature of the
Logos, invested him with not an iron, but golden wand. And he enchants the eyes of the
dead, as he says, and raises up again those that are slumbering, after having been roused
from sleep, and after having been suitors. And concerning these, he says, the Scripture
speaks: “Awake thou that sleepest, and arise, and Christ will give thee light.”365</p>
<p>This is the Christ who, he says, in all that have been generated, is the portrayed Son of
Man from the unportrayable Logos. This, he says, is the great and unspeakable mystery of
the Eleusinian rites, Hye, Cye.366 And he affirms that all things have been subjected unto
him, and this is that which has been spoken, “Their sound is gone forth unto all the earth,”367
just as it agrees with the expressions, “Mercury368 waving his wand, guides the souls, but
they twittering follow.” I mean the disembodied spirits follow continuously in such a way
as the poet by his imagery delineates, using these words:—
<lg>
<l>“And as when in the magic cave’s recess</l>
<l>Bats humming fly, and when one drops</l>
<l>From ridge of rock, and each to other closely clings.”369</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>The expression “rock,” he says, he uses of Adam. This, he affirms, is Adam: “The chief
corner-stone become the head of the corner.”370 For that in the head the substance is the
formative brain from which the entire family is fashioned.371 “Whom,” he says, “I place as
a rock at the foundations of Zion.” Allegorizing, he says, he speaks of the creation of the
man. The rock is interposed (within) the teeth, as Homer372 says, “enclosure of teeth,” that
is, a wall and fortress, in which exists the inner man, who thither has fallen from Adam, the

primal man above. And he has been “severed without hands to effect the division,”373 and
has been borne down into the image of oblivion, being earthly and clayish. And he asserts
that the twittering spirits follow him, that is, the Logos:—
<lg>
<l>“Thus these, twittering, came together; and then the souls</l>
<l>That is, he guides them;</l>
<l>Gentle Hermes led through wide-extended paths.”374</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>That is, he says, into the eternal places separated from all wickedness. For whither, he
says, did they come:—
<lg>
<l>“O’er ocean’s streams they came, and Leuca’s cliff,</l>
<l>And by the portals of the sun and land of dreams.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>This, he says, is ocean, “generation of gods and generation of men”375 ever whirled
round by the eddies of water, at one time upwards, at another time downwards. But he says
there ensues a generation of men when the ocean flows downwards; but when upwards to
the wall and fortress and the cliff of Luecas, a generation of gods takes place. This, he asserts,
is that which has been written: “I said, Ye are gods, and all children of the highest;”376 “If
ye hasten to fly out of Egypt, and repair beyond the Red Sea into the wilderness,” that is,
from earthly intercourse to the Jerusalem above, which is the mother of the living;377 “If,
moreover, again you return into Egypt,” that is, into earthly intercourse,378 “ye shall die as
men.” For mortal, he says, is every generation below, but immortal that which is begotten
above, for it is born of water only, and of spirit, being spiritual, not carnal. But what (is
born) below is carnal, that is, he says, what is written. “That which is born of the flesh is
flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.”379 This, according to them, is the spiritual
generation. This, he says, is the great Jordan380 which, flowing on (here) below, and preventing
the children of Israel from departing out of Egypt—I mean from terrestrial intercourse,
for Egypt is with them the body,—Jesus drove back, and made it flow upwards.</p>

<p>Adopting these and such like (opinions), these most marvellous Gnostics, inventors of
a novel381 grammatical art, magnify Homer as their prophet—as one, (according to them,)
who, after the mode adopted in the mysteries, announces these truths; and they mock those
who are not indoctrinated into the holy Scriptures, by betraying them into such notions.
They make, however, the following assertion: he who says that all things derive consistence
from one, is in error; but he who says that they are of three, is in possession of the truth,
and will furnish a solution of the (phenomena of the) universe. For there is, says (the
Naassene), one blessed nature of the Blessed Man, of him who is above, (namely) Adam;
and there is one mortal nature, that which is below; and there is one kingless generation,
which is begotten above, where, he says, is Mariam382 the sought-for one, and Iothor the
mighty sage, and Sephora the gazing one, and Moses whose generation is not in Egypt, for
children were born unto him in Madian; and not even this, he says, has escaped the notice
of the poets.</p>
<p>“Threefold was our partition; each obtained</p>
<p>His meed of honour due.”383</p>
<p>For, says he, it is necessary that the magnitudes be declared, and that they thus be declared
by all everywhere, “in order that hearing they may not hear, and seeing they may not
see.”384 For if, he says, the magnitudes were not declared, the world could not have obtained

consistence. These are the three tumid expressions (of these heretics), Caulacau,385 Saulasau,
Zeesar, i.e., Adam, who is farthest above; Saulasau, that is, the mortal one below; Zeesar,
that is, Jordan that flows upwards. This, he says, is the hermaphrodite man (present) in all.
But those who are ignorant of him, call him Geryon with the threefold body—Geryon, i.e.,
as if (in the sense of) flowing from earth—but (whom) the Greeks by common consent
(style) “celestial horn of the moon,” because he mixed and blended all things in all. “For all
things,” he says, “were made by him, and not even one thing was made without him, and
what was made in him is life.”386 This, says he, is the life, the ineffable generation of perfect
men, which was not known by preceding generations. But the passage, “nothing was made
without him,” refers to the formal world, for it was created without his instrumentality by
the third and fourth (of the quaternion named above). For says he, this is the cup “Condy,
out of which the king, while he quaffs, draws his omens.”387 This, he says, has been discovered
hid in the beauteous seeds of Benjamin. And the Greeks likewise, he says, speak of this in
the following terms:—
<lg>
<l>“Water to the raging mouth bring; thou slave, bring wine;</l>
<l>Intoxicate and plunge me into stupor.</l>
<l>My tankard tells me</l>
<l>The sort I must become.”388</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>This, says he, was alone sufficient for its being understood by men; (I mean) the cup of
Anacreon declaring, (albeit) mutely, an ineffable mystery. For dumb, says he, is Anacreon’s
cup; and (yet) Anacreon affirms that it speaks to himself, in language mute, as to what sort
he must become—that is spiritual, not carnal—if he shall listen in silence to the concealed
mystery. And this is the water in those fair nuptials which Jesus changing made into wine.</p>
<p>This, he says, is the mighty and true beginning of miracles389 which Jesus performed in
Cana of Galilee, and (thus) manifested the kingdom of heaven. This, says he, is the kingdom
of heaven that reposes within us as a treasure, as leaven hid in the three measures of meal.390
This is, he says, the great and ineffable mystery of the Samothracians, which it is allowable,
he says, for us only who are initiated to know. For the Samothracians expressly hand

down, in the mysteries that are celebrated among them, that (same) Adam as the primal
man. And habitually there stand in the temple of the Samothracians two images of naked
men, having both hands stretched aloft towards heaven, and their pudenda erecta, as with
the statue of Mercury on Mount Cyllene. And the aforesaid images are figures of the primal
man, and of that spiritual one that is born again, in every respect of the same substance with
that man. This, he says, is what is spoken by the Saviour: “If ye do not drink my blood, and
eat my flesh, ye will not enter into the kingdom of heaven; but even though,” He says, “ye
drink of the cup which I drink of, whither I go, ye cannot enter there.”391 For He says He
was aware of what sort of nature each of His disciples was, and that there was a necessity
that each of them should attain unto His own peculiar nature. For He says He chose twelve
disciples from the twelve tribes, and spoke by them to each tribe. On this account, He says,
the preachings of the twelve disciples neither did all hear, nor, if they heard, could they receive.
For the things that are not according to nature, are with them contrary to nature.</p>
<p>This, he says, the Thracians who dwell around Hæmus, and the Phrygians similarly
with the Thracians, denominate Corybas, because, (though) deriving the beginning of his
descent from the head above and from the unportrayed brain, and (though) permeating all
the principles of the existing state of things, (yet) we do not perceive how and in what
manner he comes down. This, says he, is what is spoken: “We have heard his voice, no doubt,
but we have not seen his shape.”392 For the voice of him that is set apart393 and portrayed
is heard; but (his) shape, which descends from above from the unportrayed one,—what sort
it is, nobody knows. It resides, however, in an earthly mould, yet no one recognises it. This,
he says, is “the god that inhabiteth the flood,” according to the Psalter, “and who speaketh
and crieth from many waters.”394 The “many waters,” he says, are the diversified generation
of mortal men, from which (generation) he cries and vociferates to the unportrayed man,
saying, “Preserve my only-begotten from the lions.”395 In reply to him, it has, says he, been
declared, “Israel, thou art my child: fear not; even though thou passest through rivers, they
shall not drown thee; even though thou passest through fire, it shall not scorch thee.”396 By
rivers he means, says he, the moist substance of generation, and by fire the impulsive principle
and desire for generation. “Thou art mine; fear not.” And again, he says, “If a mother forget
her children, so as not to have pity on them and give them food, I also will forget you.”397

Adam, he says, speaks to his own men: “But even though a woman forget these things, yet
I will not forget you. I have painted you on my hands.” In regard, however, of his ascension,
that is his regeneration, that he may become spiritual, not carnal, the Scripture, he says,
speaks (thus): “Open the gates, ye who are your rulers; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors,
and the King of glory shall come in,” that is a wonder of wonders.398 “For who,” he says,
“is this King of glory? A worm, and not a man; a reproach of man, and an outcast of the
people; himself is the King of glory, and powerful in war.”399</p>
<p>And by war he means the war that is in the body, because its frame has been made out
of hostile elements; as it has been written, he says, “Remember the conflict that exists in the
body.”400 Jacob, he says, saw this entrance and this gate in his journey into Mesopotamia,
that is, when from a child he was now becoming a youth and a man; that is, (the entrance
and gate) were made known unto him as he journeyed into Mesopotamia. But Mesopotamia,
he says, is the current of the great ocean flowing from the midst of the Perfect Man; and he
was astonished at the celestial gate, exclaiming, “How terrible is this place! it is nought else
than the house of God, and this (is) the gate of heaven.”401 On account of this, he says, Jesus
uses the words, “I am the true gate.”402 Now he who makes these statements is, he says, the
Perfect Man that is imaged from the unportrayable one from above. The Perfect Man
therefore cannot, he says, be saved, unless, entering in through this gate, he be born again.
But this very one the Phrygians, he says, call also Papa, because he tranquillized all things
which, prior to his manifestation, were confusedly and dissonantly moved. For the name,
he says, of Papa belongs simultaneously to all creatures403—celestial, and terrestrial, and
infernal—who exclaim, Cause to cease, cause to cease the discord of the world, and make
“peace for those that are afar off,” that is, for material and earthly beings; and “peace for
those that are near,”404 that is, for perfect men that are spiritual and endued with reason.
But the Phrygians denominate this same also “corpse”—buried in the body, as it were, in a
mausoleum and tomb. This, he says, is what has been declared, “Ye are whited sepulchres,
full,” he says, “of dead men’s bones within,”405 because there is not in you the living man.
And again he exclaims, “The dead shall start forth from the graves,”406 that is, from the

earthly bodies, being born again spiritual, not carnal. For this, he says, is the Resurrection
that takes place through the gate of heaven, through which, he says, all those that do not
enter remain dead. These same Phrygians, however, he says, affirm again that this very
(man), as a consequence of the change, (becomes) a god. For, he says, he becomes a god
when, having risen from the dead, he will enter into heaven through a gate of this kind. Paul
the apostle, he says, knew of this gate, partially opening it in a mystery, and stating “that he
was caught up by an angel, and ascended as far as the second and third heaven into paradise
itself; and that he beheld sights and heard unspeakable words which it would not be possible
for man to declare.”407</p>
<p>These are, he says, what are by all called the secret mysteries, “which (also we speak),
not in words taught of human wisdom, but in those taught of the Spirit, comparing spiritual
things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for
they are foolishness unto him.”408 And these are, he says, the ineffable mysteries of the
Spirit, which we alone are acquainted with. Concerning these, he says, the Saviour has declared,
“No one can come unto me, except my heavenly Father draw some one unto me.”409
For it is very difficult, he says, to accept and receive this great and ineffable mystery. And
again, it is said, the Saviour has declared, “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
heaven.”410 And it is necessary that they who perform this (will), not hear it merely, should
enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again, he says, the Saviour has declared, “The publicans
and the harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before you.”411 For “the publicans,”
he says, are those who receive the revenues412 of all things;413 but we, he says, are the publicans,
“unto whom the ends of the ages have come.”414 For “the ends,” he says, are the seeds
scattered from the unportrayable one upon the world, through which the whole cosmical
system is completed; for through these also it began to exist. And this, he says, is what has
been declared: “The sower went forth to sow. And some fell by the wayside, and was trodden
down; and some on the rocky places, and sprang up,” he says, “and on account of its having
no depth (of soil), it withered and died; and some,” he says, “fell on fair and good ground,
and brought forth fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty fold. Who hath ears,”

he says, “to hear, let him hear.”415 The meaning of this, he says, is as follows, that none becomes
a hearer of these mysteries, unless only the perfect Gnostics. This, he says, is the fair
and good land which Moses speaks of: “I will bring you into a fair and good land, into a
land flowing with milk and honey.”416 This, he says, is the honey and the milk, by tasting
which those that are perfect become kingless, and share in the Pleroma. This, he says, is the
Pleroma, through which all existent things that are produced417 have from the ingenerable
one been both produced and completed.</p>
<p>And this same (one) is styled also by418 the Phrygians “unfruitful.” For he is unfruitful
when he is carnal, and causes the desire of the flesh. This, he says, is what is spoken: “Every
tree not producing good fruit, is cut down and cast into the fire.”419 For these fruits, he says,
are only rational living men, who enter in through the third gate. They say, forsooth, “Ye
devour the dead, and make the living; (but) if ye eat the living, what will ye do?” They assert,
however, that the living “are rational faculties and minds, and men—pearls of that unportrayable
one cast before the creature below.”420 This, he says, is what (Jesus) asserts: “Throw
not that which is holy unto the dogs, nor pearls unto the swine.”421 Now they allege that
the work of swine and dogs is the intercourse of the woman with a man. And the Phrygians,
he says, call this very one “goat-herd” (Aipolis), not because, he says, he is accustomed to
feed the goats female and male, as the natural (men) use the name, but because, he says, he
is “Aipolis”—that is, always ranging over,—who both revolves and carries around the entire
cosmical system by his revolutionary motion. For the word “Polein” signifies to turn and
change things; whence, he says, they all call the twos centre of the heaven poles (Poloi).

inated “Poleis.” In this manner, he says, the Phrygians call this one “Aipolis,” inasmuch as
he everywhere ceaselessly turns all things, and changes them into their own peculiar (functions).
And the Phrygians style him, he says, “very fruitful” likewise, “because,” says he,
“more numerous are the children of the desolate one, than those of her which hath an husband;”
425 that is, things by being born again become immortal and abide for ever in great
numbers, even though the things that are produced may be few; whereas things carnal, he
says, are all corruptible, even though very many things (of this type) are produced. For this
reason, he says, “Rachel wept426 for her children, and would not,” says (the prophet), “be
comforted; sorrowing for them, for she knew,” says he, “that they are not.”427 But Jeremiah
likewise utters lamentation for Jerusalem below, not the city in Phoenicia, but the corruptible
generation below. For Jeremiah likewise, he says, was aware of the Perfect Man, of him that
is born again—of water and the Spirit not carnal. At least Jeremiah himself remarked: “He
is a man, and who shall know him?”428 In this manner, (the Naassene) says, the knowledge
of the Perfect Man is exceedingly profound, and difficult of comprehension. For, he says,
the beginning of perfection is a knowledge of man, whereas knowledge of God is absolute
perfection.</p>
<p>The Phrygians, however, assert, he says, that he is likewise “a green ear of corn reaped.”
And after the Phrygians, the Athenians, while initiating people into the Eleusinian rites,
likewise display to those who are being admitted to the highest grade at these mysteries, the
mighty, and marvellous, and most perfect secret suitable for one initiated into the highest
mystic truths: (I allude to) an ear of corn in silence reaped. But this ear of corn is also
(considered) among the Athenians to constitute the perfect enormous illumination (that
has descended) from the unportrayable one, just as the Hierophant himself (declares); not,
indeed, emasculated like Attis,429 but made a eunuch by means of hemlock, and despising430
all carnal generation. (Now) by night in Eleusis, beneath a huge fire, (the Celebrant) enacting
the great and secret mysteries, vociferates and cries aloud, saying, “August Brimo has brought
forth a consecrated son, Brimus;” that is, a potent (mother has been delivered of) a potent
child. But revered, he says, is the generation that is spiritual, heavenly, from above, and
potent is he that is so born. For the mystery is called “Eleusin” and “Anactorium.” “Eleusin,”

because, he says, we who are spiritual come flowing down from Adam above; for the word
“eleusesthai” is, he says, of the same import with the expression “to come.” But “Anactorium”
is of the same import with the expression “to ascend upwards.” This, he says, is what they
affirm who have been initiated in the mysteries of the Eleusinians. It is, however, a regulation
of law, that those who have been admitted into the lesser should again be initiated into the
Great Mysteries. For greater destinies obtain greater portions. But the inferior mysteries,
he says, are those of Proserpine below; in regard of which mysteries, and the path which
leads thither, which is wide and spacious, and conducts those that are perishing to Proserpine,
the poet likewise says:—
<lg>
<l>“But under her a fearful path extends,</l>
<l>Hollow, miry, yet best guide to</l>
<l>Highly-honoured Aphrodite’s lovely grove.”431</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>These, he says, are the inferior mysteries, those appertaining to carnal generation. Now,
those men who are initiated into these inferior (mysteries) ought to pause, and (then) be
admitted into the great (and) heavenly (ones). For they, he says, who obtain their shares (in
this mystery), receive greater portions. For this, he says, is the gate of heaven; and this a
house of God, where the Good Deity dwells alone. And into this (gate), he says, no unclean
person shall enter, nor one that is natural or carnal; but it is reserved for the spiritual only.
And those who come hither ought to cast off432 their garments, and become all of them
bridegrooms, emasculated through the virginal spirit. For this is the virgin433 who carries
in her womb and conceives and brings forth a son, not animal, not corporeal, but blessed
for evermore. Concerning these, it is said, the Saviour has expressly declared that “straight
and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there are that enter upon it; whereas
broad and spacious is the way that leadeth unto destruction, and many there are that pass
through it.”434</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Further Use Made of the System of the Phrygians; Mode of Celebrating
the Mysteries; The Mystery of the “Great Mother;” These Mysteries Have a Joint
Object of Worship with the Naasseni; The Naasseni Allegorize the Scriptural
Account of the Garden of Eden; The Allegory Applied to the Life of Jesus.</head>
<p>The Phrygians, however, further assert that the father of the universe is “Amygdalus,”
not a tree, he says, but that he is “Amygdalus” who previously existed; and he having in
himself the perfect fruit, as it were, throbbing and moving in the depth, rent his breasts, and
produced his now invisible, and nameless, and ineffable child, respecting whom we shall
speak. For the word “Amyxai” signifies, as it were, to burst and sever through, as he says
(happens) in the case of inflamed bodies, and which have in themselves any tumour; and
when doctors have cut this, they call it “Amychai.” In this way, he says, the Phrygians call
him “Amygdalus,” from which proceeded and was born the Invisible (One), “by whom all
things were made, and nothing was made without Him.”435 And the Phrygians say that
what has been thence produced is “Syrictas” (piper), because the Spirit that is born is harmonious.
“For God,” he says, “is Spirit; wherefore,” he affirms, “neither in this mountain
do the true worshippers worship, nor in Jerusalem, but in spirit. For the adoration of the
perfect ones,” he says, “is spiritual, not carnal.”436 The Spirit, however, he says, is there
where likewise the Father is named, and the Son is there born from this Father. This, he
says, is the many-named, thousand-eyed Incomprehensible One, of whom every
nature—each, however, differently—is desirous. This, he says, is the word of God, which,
he says, is a word of revelation of the Great Power. Wherefore it will be sealed, and hid,
and concealed, lying in the habitation where lies the basis of the root of the universe, viz.
Æons, Powers, Intelligences, Gods, Angels, delegated Spirits, Entities, Nonentities, Generables,
Ingenerables, Incomprehensibles, Comprehensibles, Years, Months, Days, Hours,
(and) Invisible Point from which437 what is least begins to increase gradually. That which
is, he says, nothing, and which consists of nothing, inasmuch as it is indivisible—(I mean)
a point—will become through its own reflective power a certain incomprehensible magnitude.
This, he says, is the kingdom of heaven, the grain of mustard seed,438 the point which is
indivisible in the body; and, he says, no one knows this (point) save the spiritual only. This,
he says, is what has been spoken: “There is no speech nor language where their voice is not
heard.”439</p>

<p>They rashly assume in this manner, that whatsoever things have been said and done by
all men, (may be made to harmonize) with their own particular mental view, alleging that
all things become spiritual. Whence likewise they assert, that those exhibiting themselves
in theatres,—not even these say or do anything without premeditation. Therefore, he says,
when, on the people assembling in the theatres, any one enters clad in a remarkable robe,
carrying a harp and playing a tune (upon it, accompanying it) with a song of the great
mysteries, he speaks as follows, not knowing what he says: “Whether (thou art) the race of
Saturn or happy Jupiter,440 or mighty Rhea, Hail, Attis, gloomy mutilation of Rhea. Assyrians
style thee thrice-longed-for Adonis, and the whole of Egypt (calls thee) Osiris, celestial horn
of the moon; Greeks denominate (thee) Wisdom; Samothracians, venerable Adam; Hæmonians,
Corybas; and them Phrygians (name thee) at one time Papa, at another time Corpse,
or God, or Fruitless, or Aipolos, or green Ear of Corn that has been reaped, or whom the
very fertile Amygdalus produced—a man, a musician.” This, he says, is multiform Attis,
whom while they celebrate in a hymn, they utter these words: “I will hymn Attis, son of
Rhea, not with the buzzing sounds of trumpets, or of Idæan pipers, which accord with (the
voices of) the Curetes; but I will mingle (my song) with Apollo’s music of harps, ‘evoe, evan,’
inasmuch as thou art Pan, as thou art Bacchus, as thou art shepherd of brilliant stars.”</p>
<p>On account of these and such like reasons, these constantly attend the mysteries called
those of the “Great Mother,” supposing especially that they behold by means of the ceremonies
performed there the entire mystery. For these have nothing more than the ceremonies
that are performed there, except that they are not emasculated: they merely complete the
work of the emasculated. For with the utmost severity and vigilance they enjoin (on their
votaries) to abstain, as if they were emasculated, from intercourse with a woman. The rest,
however, of the proceeding (observed in these mysteries), as we have declared at some length,
(they follow) just as (if they were) emasculated persons. And they do not worship any other
object but Naas, (from thence) being styled Naasseni. But Naas is the serpent from whom,
i.e., from the word Naas, (the Naassene) says, are all that under heaven are denominated
temples (Naous). And (he states) that to him alone—that is, Naas—is dedicated every shrine
and every initiatory rite, and every mystery; and, in general, that a religious ceremony could
not be discovered under heaven, in which a temple (Naos) has no existence; and in the
temple itself is Naas, from whom it has received its denomination of temple (Naos). And
these affirm that the serpent is a moist substance, just as Thales also, the Milesian, (spoke
of water as an originating principle,) and that nothing of existing things, immortal or mortal,
animate or inanimate, could consist at all without him. And that all things are subject unto
him, and that he is good, and that he has all things in himself, as in the horn of the one-

horned bull;441 so as that he imparts beauty and bloom to all things that exist according to
their own nature and peculiarity, as if passing through all, just as (“the river) proceeding
forth from Edem, and dividing itself into four heads.”442</p>
<p>They assert, however, that Edem is the brain, as it were, bound and tightly fastened in
encircling robes, as if (in) heaven. But they suppose that man, as far as the head only, is
Paradise, therefore that “this river, which proceeds out of Edem,” that is, from the brain, “is
divided into four heads,443 and that the name of the first river is called Phison; this is that
which encompasseth all the land of Havilath: there is gold, and the gold of that land is excellent,
and there is bdellium and the onyx stone.” This, he says, is the eye, which, by its honour
(among the rest of the bodily organs), and its colours, furnishes testimony to what is spoken.
“But the name of the second river is Gihon: this is that which compasseth the land of
Ethiopia.” This, he says, is hearing, since Gihon is (a tortuous stream), resembling a sort of
labyrinth. “And the name of the third is Tigris. This is that which floweth over against (the
country of) the Assyrians.” This, he says,444 is smelling, employing the exceedingly rapid
current of the stream (as an analogy of this sense). But it flows over against (the country of)
the Assyrians, because in every act of respiration following upon expiration, the breath
drawn in from the external atmosphere enters with swifter motion and greater force. For
this, he says, is the nature of respiration. “But the fourth river is Euphrates.” This, they assert,
is the mouth, through which are the passage outwards of prayer, and the passage inwards
of nourishment. (The mouth) makes glad, and nurtures and fashions the Spiritual Perfect
Man. This, he says, is “the water that is above the firmament,”445 concerning which, he says,
the Saviour has declared, “If thou knewest who it is that asks, thou wouldst have asked from
Him, and He would have given you to drink living, bubbling water.”446 Into this water, he
says, every nature enters, choosing its own substances; and its peculiar quality comes to
each nature from this water, he says, more than iron does to the magnet, and the gold to
the backbone447 of the sea falcon, and the chaff to the amber.</p>

vine the wine; and (so is it with) the rest of plants, according to each genus. That Man,

<p>The foregoing remarks, then, though few out of many, we have thought proper to bring

our ability, we have explained the unknown Gnosis, it seemed expedient likewise to adduce

<p>There is also unquestionably a certain other (head of the hydra,454 namely, the heresy)
of the Peratæ,455 whose blasphemy against Christ has for many years escaped notice. And
the present is a fitting opportunity for bringing to light the secret mysteries of such (heretics).
These allege that the world is one, triply divided. And of the triple division with them, one
portion is a certain single originating principle, just as it were a huge fountain, which can
be divided mentally into infinite segments. Now the first segment, and that which, according
to them, is (a segment) in preference (to others),456 is a triad, and it is called a Perfect Good,
(and) a Paternal Magnitude. And the second portion of the triad of these is, as it were, a
certain infinite crowd of potentialities that are generated457 from themselves, (while) the
third is formal.458 And the first, which is good, is unbegotten, and the second is a self-producing
good, and the third is created; and hence it is that they expressly declare that there
are three Gods, three Logoi, three Minds, three Men. For to each portion of the world, after
the division has been made, they assign both Gods, and Logoi, and Minds, and Men, and
the rest; but that from unorigination and the first segment459 of the world, when afterwards
the world had attained unto its completion, there came down from above, for causes that

we shall afterwards declare, in the time of Herod a certain man called Christ, with a threefold
nature, and a threefold body, and a threefold power, (and) having in himself all (species of)
concretions and potentialities (derivable) from the three divisions of the world; and that
this, says (the Peratic), is what is spoken: “It pleased him that in him should dwell all fulness
bodily,”460 and in Him the entire Divinity resides of the triad as thus divided. For, he says,
that from the two superjacent worlds—namely, from that (portion of the triad) which is
unbegotten, and from that which is self-producing—there have been conveyed down into
this world in which we are, seeds of all sorts of potentialities. What, however, the mode of
the descent is, we shall afterwards declare.</p>
<p>(The Peratic) then says that Christ descended from above from unorigination, that by
His descent all things triply divided might be saved. For some things, he says, being borne
down from above, will ascend through Him, whereas whatever (beings) form plots against
those which are carried down from above are cast off,461 and being placed in a state of
punishment, are renounced. This, he says, is what is spoken: “For the Son of man came not
into the world to destroy the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.” The
world, he says, he denominates those two parts that are situated above, viz., both the unbegotten
(portion of the triad), and the self-produced one. And when Scripture, he says, uses
the words, “that we may not be condemned with the world,” it alludes to the third portion
of (the triad, that is) the formal world. For the third portion, which he styles the world (in
which we are), must perish; but the two (remaining portions), which are situated above,
must be rescued from corruption.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Peratæ Derive Their System from the Astrologers; This Proved
by a Statement of the Astrological Theories of the Zodiac; Hence the Terminology
of the Peratic Heretics.</head>
<p>Let us, then, in the first place, learn how (the Peratists), deriving this doctrine from astrologers,
act despitefully towards Christ, working destruction for those who follow them
in an error of this description. For the astrologers, alleging that there is one world, divide
it into the twelve fixed portions of the zodiacal signs, and call the world of the fixed zodiacal
signs one immoveable world; and the other they affirm to be a world of erratic (signs), both
in power, and position, and number, and that it extends as far as the moon.462 And (they
lay down), that (one) world derives from (the other) world a certain power, and mutual
participation (in that power), and that the subjacent obtain this participation from the superjacent
(portions). In order, however, that what is (here) asserted may be perspicuous, I
shall one by one employ those very expressions of the astrologers; (and in doing so) I shall
only be reminding my readers of statements previously made in the department of the work
where we have explained the entire art of the astrologers. What, then, the opinions are which
those (speculators) entertain, are as follow:—</p>
<p>(Their doctrine is), that from an emanation of the stars the generations of the subjacent
(parts) is consummated. For, as they wistfully gazed upward upon heaven, the Chaldeans
asserted that (the seven stars)463 contain a reason for the efficient causes of the occurrence
of all the events that happen unto us, and that the parts of the fixed zodiacal signs co-operate
(in this influence). Into twelve (parts they divide the zodiacal circle), and each zodiacal sign
into thirty portions, and each portion into sixty diminutive parts; for so they denominate
the very smallest parts, and those that are indivisible. And of the zodiacal signs, they term
some male, but others feminine; and some with two bodies, but others not so; and some
tropical, whereas others firm. The male signs, then, are either feminine, which possess a cooperative
nature for the procreation of males, (or are themselves productive of females.)
For Aries is a male zodiacal sign, but Taurus female; and the rest (are denominated) according
to the same analogy, some male, but others female. And I suppose that the Pythagoreans,
being swayed from such (considerations), style the Monad male, and the Duad female; and,
again, the Triad male, and analogically the remainder of the even and odd numbers. Some,
however, dividing each zodiacal sign into twelve parts, employ almost the same method.
For example, in Aries, they style the first of the twelve parts both Aries and a male, but the
second both Taurus and a female, and the third both Gemini and a male; and the same plan
is pursued in the case of the rest of the parts. And they assert that there are signs with two
bodies, viz., Gemini and the signs diametrically opposite, namely Sagittarius, and Virgo,
<note type="footnote">462 Or, “is part of the moon.”</note>
<note type="footnote">463 Some omissions here are supplied from Sextus Empiricus.</note>

<pb n="155"/>
and Pisces, and that the rest have not two bodies. And (they state) that some are likewise
tropical, and when the sun stands in these, he causes great turnings464 of the surrounding
(sign). Aries is a sign of this description, and that which is diametrically opposite to it, just
as Libra, and Capricorn, and Cancer. For in Aries is the vernal turning, and in Capricorn
that of winter, and in Cancer that of summer, and in Libra that of autumn.</p>
<p>The details, however, concerning this system we have minutely explained in the book
preceding this; and from it any one who wishes instruction (on the point), may learn how
it is that the originators of this Peratic heresy, viz., Euphrates the Peratic, and Celbes the
Carystian,465 have, in the transference (into their own system of opinions from these sources),
made alterations in name only, while in reality they have put forward similar tenets. (Nay
more), they have, with immoderate zeal, themselves devoted (their attention) to the art (of
the astrologers). For also the astrologers speak of the limits of the stars, in which they assert
that the dominant stars have greater influence; as, for instance, on some they act injuriously,
while on others they act well. And of these they denominate some malicious, and some beneficent.
And (stars) are said to look upon one another, and to harmonize with each other,
so that they appear according to (the shape of) a triangle or square. The stars, looking on
one another, are figured according to (the shape of466) a triangle, having an intervening
distance of the extent of three zodiacal signs; whereas (those that have an interval of) two
zodiacal signs are figured according to (the shape of) a square. And (their doctrine is), that
as in the same way as in a man, the subjacent parts sympathize with the head, and the head
likewise sympathizes with the subjacent parts, so all terrestrial (sympathize) with superlunar467
objects. But (the astrologers go further than this468); for there exists (according to
them) a certain difference and incompatibility469 between these, so as that they do not involve
<note type="footnote">464 Or, “produces alterations and causes turnings.”</note>
<note type="footnote">465 Celbes, as observed in a former note, has two other forms in The Refutation, viz., Acembes and Ademes.
He is called Carystius, and the other founder of the heresy Peraticus. As the latter term is frequently used to
designate Euboea, i.e., the country beyond (πέραν) the continent, it is inferred that Carystius has a similar import.
This would seem placed beyond conjecture by a passage (Strom., vii. vol. ii. p. 555) in Clemens Alexandrinus,
already alluded to, who says that some heresies, e.g., those of the Marcionites and Basilidians, derived their denomination
from the names, whereas others from the country, of their founders. As an instance of the latter,
he mentions the Peratics (see note 4, p. 62, [and note 6, p. 58]).</note>

one and the same union. This combination and divergence of the stars, which is a Chaldean
(tenet), has been arrogated to themselves by those of whom we have previously spoken.</p>
<p>Now these, falsifying the name of truth, proclaim as a doctrine of Christ an insurrection
of Æons and revolts of good into (the ranks of) evil powers; and they speak of the confederations
of good powers with wicked ones. Denominating them, therefore, Toparchai and
Proastioi,470 and (though thus) framing for themselves very many other names not suggested
(to them from other sources), they have yet unskilfully systematized the entire imaginary
doctrine of the astrologers concerning the stars. And since they have introduced a supposition
pregnant with immense error, they shall be refuted through the instrumentality of our admirable
arrangement. For I shall set down, in contrast with the previously mentioned
Chaldaic art of the astrologers, some of the Peratic471 treatises, from which, by means of
comparison, there will be an opportunity of perceiving how the Peratic doctrines are those
confessedly of the astrologers, not of Christ.</p>

<p>It seems, then, expedient to set forth a certain one of the books held472 in repute amongst
them, in which the following passage473 occurs: “I am a voice of arousal from slumber in
the age of night. Henceforward I commence to strip the power which is from chaos. The
power is that of the lowest depth of mud, which uprears the slime of the incorruptible (and)
humid expanse of space. And it is the entire power of the convulsion, which, ever in motion,
and presenting the colour of water, whirls things on that are stationary, restrains things
tremulous, sets things free as they proceed, lightens474 things as they abide, removes things
on the increase, a faithful steward of the track of the breezes, enjoying the things disgorged
from the twelve eyes of the law,475 (and) manifesting a seal476 to the power which along
with itself distributes the downborne invisible waters, and has been called Thalassa. This
power ignorance has been accustomed to denominate Cronus, guarded with chains because
he tightly bound the fold of the dense and misty and obscure and murky Tartarus. According
to the image of this were produced Cepheus, Prometheus, (and) Japetus. The Power to
which has been entrusted Thalassa477 is hermaphrodite. And it fastens the hissing sound
arising from the twelve mouths into twelve pipes, and pours it forth. And the power itself
is subtle, and removes the controlling, boisterous, upward motion (of the sea), and seals the
tracks of its paths, lest (any antagonistic power) should wage war or introduce any alteration.

<head>Chapter X.—The Peratic Heresy Nominally Different from Astrology, But Really
the Same System Allegorized.</head>
<p>It has been easily made evident to all, that the heresy of the Peratæ is altered in name
only from the (art) of the astrologers. And the rest of the books of these (heretics) contain
the same method, if it were agreeable to any one to wade through them all. For, as I said,
they suppose that the causes of the generation of all begotten things are things unbegotten
and superjacent, and that the world with us has been produced after the mode of emanation,
which (world) they denominate formal. And (they maintain) that all those stars together
which are beheld in the firmament have been causes of the generation of this world. They
have, however, altered the name of these, as one may perceive from the Proastioi by means
of a comparison (of the two systems). And secondly, according to the same method as that
whereby the world was made from a supernal emanation, they affirm that in this manner
objects here derive from the emanation of the stars their generation, and corruption, and
arrangement. Since, then, astrologers are acquainted with the horoscope, and meridian, and
setting, and the point opposite the meridian; and since these stars occupy at different times
different positions486 in space, on account of the perpetual revolution of the universe, there
are (necessarily) at different periods different declinations towards a centre, and (different)
ascensions to centres.487 (Now the Peratic heretics), affixing an allegorical import to this
arrangement of the astrologers, delineate the centre, as it were, a god and monad and lord
over universal generation, whereas the declination (is regarded by them as a power) on the
left, and ascension on the right. When any one, therefore, falling in with the treatises of
these (heretics), finds mention among them of right or left power, let him recur to the centre,
and the declination, and the ascension (of the Chaldean sages, and) he will clearly observe
that the entire system of these (Peratæ) consists of the astrological doctrine.</p>

by an Appeal to Antiquity; Their Interpretation of the Exodus of Israel;
Their System of “The Serpent;” Deduced by Them from Scripture; This the Real
Import of the Doctrines of the Astrologers.</head>
<p>They denominate themselves, however, Peratæ, imagining that none of those things
existing by generation can escape the determined lot for those things that derive their existence
from generation. For if, says (the Peratic), anything be altogether begotten, it also
perishes, as also is the opinion of the Sibyl.488 But we alone, he says, who are conversant
with the necessity of generation, and the paths through which man has entered into the
world, and who have been accurately instructed (in these matters), we alone are competent
to proceed through and pass beyond destruction.489 But water, he says, is destruction; nor
did the world, he says, perish by any other thing quicker than by water. Water, however, is
that which rolls around among the Proastioi, (and) they assert (it to be) Cronus. For such
a power, he says, is of the colour of water; and this power, he says—that is, Cronus—none
of those things existent by generation can escape. For Cronus is a cause to every generation,
in regard of succumbing under destruction, and there could not exist (an instance of) generation
in which Cronus does not interfere. This, he says, is what the poets also affirm, and
what even appals the gods:—
<lg>
<l>“For know, he says, this earth and spacious heaven above,</l>
<l>And Styx’ flooded water, which is the oath</l>
<l>That greatest is, and dreaded most by gods of happy life.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>And not only, he says, do the poets make this statement, but already also the very wisest
men among the Greeks. And Heraclitus is even one of these, employing the following words:
“For to souls water becomes death.” This death, (the Peratic) says, seizes the Egyptians in
the Red Sea, along with their chariots. All, however, who are ignorant (of this fact), he says,
are Egyptians. And this, they assert, is the departure from Egypt, (that is,) from the body.
For they suppose little Egypt to be body, and that it crosses the Red Sea—that is, the water
of corruption, which is Cronus—and that it reaches a place beyond the Red Sea, that is,
generation; and that it comes into the wilderness, that is, that it attains a condition independent
of generation, where there exist promiscuously all the gods of destruction and the God
of salvation.</p>

as this was not the true one (see note 1, p. 60), but merely an after-thought. The title of one of the Peratic
treatises, as altered by Bunsen from Οἱ προάστειοι ἕως αιθέρος into Οἱ Περάται ἕως αἰθέρος, i.e., “the

<p>Now, he says, the stars are the gods of destruction, which impose upon existent things
the necessity of alterable generation. These, he says, Moses denominated serpents of the
wilderness, which gnaw and utterly ruin those who imagined that they had crossed the Red
Sea. To those, then, he says, who of the children of Israel were bitten in the wilderness,
Moses exhibited the real and perfect serpent; and they who believed on this serpent were
not bitten in the wilderness, that is, (were not assailed) by (evil) powers. No one therefore,
he says, is there who is able to save and deliver those that come forth from Egypt, that is,
from the body and from this world, unless alone the serpent that is perfect and replete with
fulness. Upon this (serpent), he says, he who fixes his hope is not destroyed by the snakes
of the wilderness, that is, by the gods of generation. (This statement) is written, he says, in
a book of Moses. This serpent, he says, is the power that attended Moses,490 the rod that
was turned into a serpent. The serpents, however, of the magicians—(that is,) the gods of
destruction—withstood the power of Moses in Egypt, but the rod of Moses reduced them
all to subjection and slew them. This universal serpent is, he says, the wise discourse of Eve.
This, he says, is the mystery of Edem, this the river of Edem; this the mark that was set upon
Cain, that any one who findeth him might not kill him. This, he says,491 is Cain,492 whose
sacrifice493 the god of this world did not accept. The gory sacrifice, however, of Abel he
approved of; for the ruler of this world rejoices in (offerings of) blood. This, he says, is he
who appeared in the last days, in form of a man, in the times of Herod, being born after the
likeness of Joseph, who was sold by the hand of his brethren, to whom alone belonged the
coat of many colours. This, he says, is he who is according to the likeness of Esau, whose
garment—he not being himself present—was blessed; who did not receive, he says, the benediction
uttered by him of enfeebled vision.494 He acquired, however, wealth from a source
independent of this, receiving nothing from him whose eyes were dim; and Jacob saw his
countenance,495 as a man beholds the face of God. In regard of this, he says, it has been
written that “Nebrod was a mighty hunter before the Lord.”496 And there are, he says, many
who closely imitate this (Nimrod): as numerous are they as the gnawing (serpents) which
were seen in the wilderness by the children of Israel, from which that perfect serpent which
Moses set up delivered those that were bitten. This, he says, is that which has been declared:
“In the same manner as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so also must the Son

of man be lifted up.”497 According to the likeness of this was made in the desert the brazen
serpent which Moses set up. Of this alone, he says, the image is in heaven, always conspicuous
in light.</p>
<p>This, he says, is the great beginning respecting which Scripture has spoken. Concerning
this, he says it has been declared: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God, all things were made by
Him, and without Him was not one thing that was made. And what was formed in Him is
life.”498 And in Him, he says, has been formed Eve; (now) Eve is life. This, however, he says,
is Eve, mother of all living,499—a common nature, that is, of gods, angels, immortals, mortals,
irrational creatures, (and) rational ones. For, he says, the expression “all” he uttered of all
(existences). And if the eyes of any, he says, are blessed, this one, looking upward on the
firmament, will behold at the mighty summit500 of heaven the beauteous image of the serpent,
turning itself, and becoming an originating principle of every (species of) motion to all
things that are being produced. He will (thereby) know that without him nothing consists,
either of things in heaven, or things on earth. or things under the earth. Not night, not
moon, not fruits, not generation, not wealth, not sustenance, not anything at all of existent
things, is without his guidance. In regard of this, he says, is the great wonder which is beheld
in the firmament by those who are able to observe it. For, he says, at this top of his head, a
fact which is more incredible than all things to those who are ignorant, “are setting and
rising mingled one with other.” This it is in regard of which ignorance is in the habit of affirming:

<head>Chapter XII.—Compendious Statement of the Doctrines of the Peratæ.</head>
<p>This is the diversified wisdom of the Peratic heresy, which it is difficult to declare in its
entirety, so intricate is it on account of its seeming to consist of the astrological art. As far
forth, then, as this is possible, we shall briefly explain the whole force of this (heresy). In
order, however, that we may by a compendious statement elucidate the entire doctrine of
these persons, it appears expedient to subjoin the following observations. According to
them, the universe is Father, Son, (and) Matter; (but) each of these three has endless capacities
in itself. Intermediate, then, between the Matter and the Father sits the Son, the Word,
the Serpent, always being in motion towards the unmoved Father, and (towards) Matter itself
in motion. And at one time he is turned towards the Father, and receives the powers into
his own person; but at another time takes up these powers, and is turned towards Matter.
And Matter, (though) devoid of attribute, and being unfashioned, moulds (into itself) forms
from the Son which the Son moulded from the Father.</p>
<p>But the Son derives shape from the Father after a mode ineffable, and unspeakable, and
unchangeable; (that is,) in such a manner as Moses says that the colours of the conceived
(kine) flowed from the rods503 which were fixed in the drinking-troughs. And in like manner,
again, that capacities flowed also from the Son into Matter, similarly to the power in reference
to conception which came from the rods upon the conceived (kine). And the difference of
colours, and the dissimilarity which flowed from the rods through the waters upon the
sheep, is, he says, the difference of corruptible and incorruptible generation. As, however,
one who paints from nature, though he takes nothing away from animals, transfers by his
pencil all forms to the canvas; so the Son, by a power which belongs to himself, transfers
paternal marks from the Father into Matter. All the paternal marks are here, and there are
not any more. For if any one, he says, of those (beings) which are here will have strength to
perceive that he is a paternal mark transferred hither from above, (and that he is) incarnate—
just as by the conception resulting from the rod a something white is produced,—he
is of the same substance altogether with the Father in heaven, and returns thither. If, however,
he may not happen upon this doctrine, neither will he understand the necessity of generation,
just as an abortion born at night will perish at night. When, therefore, he says, the Saviour
observes, “your Father which is in heaven,”504 he alludes to that one from whom the Son
deriving his characteristics has transferred them hither. When, however, (Jesus) remarks,
“Your father is a murderer from the beginning,”505 he alludes to the Ruler and Demiurge
of matter, who, appropriating the marks delivered from the Son, generated him here who
from the beginning was a murderer, for his work causes corruption and death.</p>

<note type="footnote">504 Matt. vii. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">505 John viii. 44.</note>

<pb n="165"/>
<p>No one, then, he says, can be saved or return (into heaven) without the Son, and the
Son is the Serpent. For as he brought down from above the paternal marks, so again he
carries up from thence those marks roused from a dormant condition and rendered paternal
characteristics, substantial ones from the unsubstantial Being, transferring them hither from
thence. This, he says, is what is spoken: “I am the door.”506 And he transfers (those marks),
he says,507 to those who close the eyelid, as the naphtha drawing the fire in every direction
towards itself; nay rather, as the magnet (attracting) the iron and not anything else, or just
as the backbone of the sea falcon, the gold and nothing else, or as the chaff is led by the
amber. In this manner, he says, is the portrayed, perfect, and consubstantial genus drawn
again from the world by the Serpent; nor does he (attract) anything else, as it has been sent
down by him. For a proof of this, they adduce the anatomy508 of the brain, assimilating,
from the fact of its immobility, the brain itself to the Father, and the cerebellum to the Son,
because of its being moved and being of the form of (the head of) a serpent. And they allege
that this (cerebellum), by an ineffable and inscrutable process, attracts through the pineal
gland the spiritual and life-giving substance emanating from the vaulted chamber509 (in
which the brain is embedded). And on receiving this, the cerebellum in an ineffable manner
imparts the ideas, just as the Son does, to matter; or, in other words, the seeds and the genera
of the things produced according to the flesh flow along into the spinal marrow. Employing
this exemplar, (the heretics) seem to adroitly introduce their secret mysteries, which are
delivered in silence. Now it would be impious for us to declare these; yet it is easy to form
an idea of them, by reason of the many statements that have been made.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—The System of the Sethians; Their Triad of Infinite Principles; Their
Heresy Explained; Their Interpretation of the Incarnation.</head>
<p>Let us then see what the Sithians511 affirm. To these it appears that there are three definite
principles of the universe, and that each of these principles possesses infinite powers.
And when they speak of powers512 let him that heareth take into account that they make
this statement. Everything whatsoever you discern by an act of intelligence, or also omit (to
discern) as not being understood, this by nature is fitted to become each of the principles,
as in the human soul every art whatsoever which is made the subject of instruction. Just for
instance, he says, this child will be a musician, having waited the requisite time for (acquiring
a knowledge of) the harp; or a geometrician, (having previously undergone the necessary
study for acquiring a knowledge) of geometry; (or) a grammarian, (after having sufficiently
studied) grammar; (or) a workman, (having acquired a practical acquaintance) with a handicraftsman’s
business; and to one brought into contact with the rest of the arts a similar
occurrence will take place. Now of principles, he says, the substances are light and darkness;
and of these, spirit is intermediate without admixture. The spirit, however, is that which
has its appointed place in the midst of darkness which is below, and light which is above. It
is not spirit as a current of wind, or some gentle breeze that can be felt; but, as it were, some
odour of ointment or of incense formed out of a compound. (It is) a subtle power, that insinuates
itself by means of some impulsive quality in a fragrance, which is inconceivable
and better than could be expressed by words. Since, however, light is above and darkness
below, and spirit is intermediate in such a way as stated between these; and since light is so
constituted, that, like a ray of the sun, it shines from above upon the underlying darkness;
and again, since the fragrance of the spirit, holding an intermediate place, is extended and
carried in every direction, as in the case of incense-offerings placed upon fire, we detect the
fragrance that is being wafted in every direction: when, I say, there is a power of this description
belonging unto the principles which are classified under three divisions, the power of
spirit and light simultaneously exists in the darkness that is situated underneath them. But
the darkness is a terrible water, into which light is absorbed and translated into a nature of
the same description with spirit. The darkness, however, is not devoid of intelligence, but
altogether reflective, and is conscious that, where the light has been abstracted from the
darkness, the darkness remains isolated, invisible, obscure, impotent, inoperative, (and)
<note type="footnote">511 This is the form in which the name occurs in Hippolytus, but the correct one is Sethians. As regards this
sect, see Irenæus, Contr. Hæres., i. 30; Tertullian, Præscript., c. lxvii.; Theodoret, Hæret. Fabul., i. 14; Epiphanius,

feeble. Wherefore it is constrained, by all its reflection and understanding, to collect into
itself the lustre and scintillation of light with the fragrance of the spirit. And it is possible
to behold an image of the nature of these in the human countenance; for instance, the pupil
of the eye, dark from the subjacent humours, (but) illuminated with spirit. As, then, the
darkness seeks after the splendour, that it may keep in bondage the spark, and may have
perceptive power, so the light and spirit seek after the power that belongs to themselves,
and strive to uprear, and towards each other to carry up their intermingled powers into the
dark and formidable water lying underneath.</p>
<p>But all the powers of the three originating principles, which are as regards number indefinitely
infinite, are each according to its own substance reflective and intelligent, unnumbered
in multitude. And since what are reflective and intelligent are numberless in
multitude, while they continue by themselves, they are all at rest. If, however, power approaches
power, the dissimilarity of (what is set in) juxtaposition produces a certain motion
and energy, which are formed from the motion resulting from the concourse effected by
the juxtaposition of the coalescing powers. For the concourse of the powers ensues, just
like any mark of a seal513 that is impressed by means of the concourse correspondingly with
(the seal) which prints the figure on the substances that are brought up (into contact with
it). Since, therefore, the powers of the three principles are infinite in number, and from infinite
powers (arise) infinite concourses, images of infinite seals are necessarily produced.
These images, therefore, are the forms of the different sorts of animals. From the first great
concourse, then, of the three principles, ensues a certain great form, a seal of heaven and
earth. The heaven and the earth have a figure similar to the womb, having a navel in the
midst; and if, he says, any one is desirous of bringing this figure under the organ of vision,
let him artfully scrutinize the pregnant womb of whatsoever animal he wishes, and he will
discover an image of the heaven and the earth, and of the things which in the midst of all
are unalterably situated underneath.</p>
<p>(And so it is, that the first great concourse of the three principles) has produced such a
figure of heaven and earth as is similar to a womb after the first coition. But, again, in the
midst of the heaven and the earth have been generated infinite concourses of powers. And
each concourse did not effect and fashion anything else than a seal of heaven and earth
similar to a womb. But, again, in the earth, from the infinite seals are produced infinite
crowds of various animals. But into all this infinity of the different animals under heaven
is diffused and distributed, along with the light, the fragrance of the Spirit from above. From
the water, therefore, has been produced a first-begotten originating principle, viz., wind,
(which is) violent and boisterous, and a cause of all generation. For producing a sort of ferment
in the waters, (the wind) uplifts waves out of the waters; and the motion514 of the
<note type="footnote">513 Or, “form of a seal.”</note>
<note type="footnote">514 Or, “production.”</note>

<pb n="169"/>
waves, just as when some impulsive power of pregnancy is the origin of the production of
a man or mind,515 is caused when (the ocean), excited by the impulsive power of spirit, is
propelled forward. When, however, this wave that has been raised out of the water by the
wind, and rendered pregnant in its nature, has within itself obtained the power, possessed
by the female, of generation, it holds together the light scattered from above along with the
fragrance of the spirit—that is, mind moulded in the different species. And this (light) is a
perfect God, who from the unbegotten radiance above, and from the spirit, is borne down
into human nature as into a temple, by the impulsive power of Nature, and by the motion
of wind. And it is produced from water being commingled516 and blended with bodies as
if it were a salt517 of existent things, and a light of darkness. And it struggles to be released
from bodies, and is not able to find liberation and an egress for itself. For a very diminutive
spark, a severed splinter from above like the ray of a star, has been mingled in the much
compounded waters of many (existences),518 as, says he, (David) remarks in a psalm.519
Every thought, then, and solicitude actuating the supernal light is as to how and in what
manner mind may be liberated, by the death of the depraved and dark body, from the
Father that is below, which is the wind that with noise520 and tumult uplifted the waves,
and who generated a perfect mind his own Son; not, however, being his peculiar (offspring)
substantially. For he was a ray (sent down) from above, from that perfect light, (and) was
overpowered in the dark,521 and formidable, and bitter, and defiled water; and he is a luminous
spirit borne down over the water.522 When, therefore, the waves that have been upreared
from the waters have received within themselves the power of generation possessed by females,
they contain, as a certain womb, in different species, the infused radiance, so as that

it is visible in the case of all animals.523 But the wind, at the same time fierce and formidable,
524 whirling along, is, in respect of its hissing sound, like a serpent.525</p>
<p>First, then, from the wind—that is, from the serpent—has resulted the originating
principle of generation in the manner declared, all things having simultaneously received
the principle of generation. After, then, the light and the spirit had been received, he says,
into the polluted and baneful (and) disordered womb, the serpent—the wind of the darkness,
the first-begotten of the waters—enters within and produces man, and the impure womb
neither loves nor recognises any other form. The perfect Word of supernal light being
therefore assimilated (in form) to the beast, (that is,) the serpent, entered into the defiled
womb, having deceived (the womb) through the similitude of the beast itself, in order that
(the Word) may loose the chains that encircle the perfect mind which has been begotten
amidst impurity of womb by the primal offspring of water, (namely,) serpent, wind, (and)
beast.526 This, he says, is the form of the servant,527 and this the necessity of the Word of
God coming down into the womb of a virgin. But he says it is not sufficient that the Perfect
Man, the Word, has entered into the womb of a virgin, and loosed the pangs528 which were
in that darkness. Nay, more than this was requisite; for after his entrance529 into the foul
mysteries of the womb, he was washed, and drank of the cup of life-giving bubbling water.530
And it was altogether needful that he should drink who was about to strip off the servile
form, and assume celestial raiment.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—The Sethians Support Their Doctrines by an Allegorical Interpretation
of Scripture; Their System Really Derived from Natural Philosophers and from
the Orphic Rites; Adopt the Homeric Cosmogony.</head>
<p>These are the statements which the patrons531 of the Sethian doctrines make, as far as
it is possible to declare in a few words. Their system, however, is made up (of tenets) from
natural (philosophers), and of expressions uttered in reference to different other subjects;
and transferring (the sense of) these to the Eternal532 Logos, they explain them as we have
declared. But they assert likewise that Moses confirms their doctrine when he says, “Darkness,
and mist, and tempest.” These, (the Sethian) says, are the three principles (of our system);
or when he states that three were born in paradise—Adam, Eve, the serpent; or when he
speaks of three (persons, namely) Cain, Abel, Seth; and again of three (others)—Shem,
Ham,533 Japheth; or when he mentions three patriarchs—Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; or when
he speaks of the existence of three days before sun and moon; or when he mentions three
laws—prohibitory, permissive, and adjudicatory of punishment. Now, a prohibitory law is
as follows: “Of every tree that is in paradise thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil thou mayest not eat.”534 But in the passage, “Come forth from
thy land and from thy kindred, and hither into a land which I shall show thee,”535 this law,
he says, is permissive; for one who is so disposed may depart, and one who is not so disposed
may remain. But a law adjudicatory of punishment is that which makes the following declaration:
“Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal;”536 for a
penalty is awarded to each of these acts of wickedness.</p>
<p>The entire system of their doctrine, however, is (derived) from537 the ancient theologians
Musæus, and Linus, and Orpheus,538 who elucidates especially the ceremonies of initiation,

as well as the mysteries themselves. For their doctrine concerning the womb is also the
tenet of Orpheus; and the (idea of the) navel,539 which is harmony,540 is (to be found) with
the same symbolism attached to it in the Bacchanalian orgies of Orpheus. But prior to the
observance of the mystic rite of Celeus, and Triptolemus, and Ceres, and Proserpine, and
Bacchus in Eleusis, these orgies have been celebrated and handed down to men in Phlium
of Attica.541 For antecedent to the Eleusinian mysteries, there are (enacted) in Phlium the
orgies542 of her denominated the “Great (Mother).” There is, however, a portico in this
(city), and on the portico is inscribed a representation, (visible) up to the present day, of all
the words which are spoken (on such occasions). Many, then, of the words inscribed upon
that portico are those respecting which Plutarch institutes discussions in his ten books
against543 Empedocles. And in the greater544 number of these books is also drawn the representation
of a certain aged man, grey-haired, winged,545 having his pudendum erectum,
pursuing a retreating woman of azure colour.546 And over the aged man is the inscription
“phaos ruentes,” and over the woman “pereëphicola.”547 But “phaos ruentes”548 appears
to be the light (which exists), according to the doctrine of the Sethians, and “phicola” the
darkish water; while the space in the midst of these seems to be a harmony constituted from
the spirit that is placed between. The name, however, of “phaos ruentes” manifests, as they
allege, the flow from above of the light downwards. Wherefore one may reasonably assert

that the Sethians celebrate rites among themselves, very closely bordering upon those orgies
of the “Great (Mother” which are observed among) the Phliasians. And the poet likewise
seems to bear his testimony to this triple division, when he remarks, “And all things have
been triply divided, and everything obtains its (proper) distinction;”549 that is, each member
of the threefold division has obtained (a particular) capacity. But now, as regards the tenet
that the subjacent water below, which is dark, ought, because the light has set (over it), to
convey upwards and receive the spark borne down from (the light) itself; in the assertion
of this tenet, I say, the all-wise Sethians appear to derive (their opinion) from Homer:—

<l>“By earth I sware, and yon broad Heaven above,</l>
<l>And Stygian stream beneath, the weightiest oath</l>
<l>Of solemn power, to bind the blessed gods.”550</l>

</p>
<p>That is, according to Homer, the gods suppose water to be loathsome and horrible.
Now, similar to this is the doctrine of the Sethians, which affirms (water) to be formidable
to the mind.551</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—The Sethian Theory Concerning “Mixture” And “Composition;”
Application of It to Christ; Illustration from the Well of Ampa.</head>
<p>These, and other assertions similar to these, are made (by the Sethians) in their inter-
minable commentaries. They, however, persuade their disciples to become conversant with
the theory respecting composition and mixture. But this theory has formed a subject of
meditation to many, but (among others) also to Andronicus the Peripatetic. The Sethians,
then, affirm that the theory concerning composition and mixture is constituted according
to the following method: The luminous ray from above is intermingled, and the very diminutive
spark is delicately blended in the dark waters beneath; and (both of these) become
united, and are formed into one compound mass, just as a single savour (results) from the
mixture of many incense-offerings in the fire, and (just as) an adept, by having a test in an
acute sense of smell, ought to be able from the single odour of the incense to distinguish
accurately each (ingredient) of the incense-offerings that have been mingled in the
fire,—whether, for example, storax, and myrrh, and frankincense, or whatever other (ingredient)
may be mixed (in the incense). They, however, employ also other examples, saying
both that brass is mixed with gold, and that some art has been discovered which separates
the brass from the gold. And, in like manner, if tin or brass, or any substance homogeneous
with it, be discovered mixed with silver, these likewise, by some art superior to that of mixing,
are distinguished. But already some one also distinguishes water mingled with wine.552 So,
say they, though all things are commingled, they are capable of being separated. Nay, but,
he says, derive the same lesson from the case of animals. For when the animal is dead, each
of its parts is separated; and when dissolution takes place, the animal in this way vanishes.
This is, he says, what has been spoken: “I came not to send peace on the earth, but a
sword,”553—that is, the division and separation of the things that have been commingled.
For each of the things that have been commingled is separated and divided when it reaches
its proper place. For as there is one place of mixture for all animals, so also has there been
established one (locality) of separation. And, he says, no one is aware of this (place), save
we alone that have been born again, spiritual, not carnal, whose citizenship is in heaven
above.</p>
<p>In this manner insinuating themselves, they corrupt their pupils, partly by misusing the
words spoken (by themselves), while they wickedly pervert, to serve any purpose they wish,
what has been admirably said (in Scripture); and partly by concealing their nefarious conduct,
by means of whatever comparisons they please. All these things, then, he says, that have

wayside fountain, mixed, so they say; and even though all things be intermingled, a separation is effected.”</note>

been commingled, possess, as has been declared, their own particular place, and hurry towards
their own peculiar (substances), as iron towards the magnet, and the chaff to the vicinity
of amber, and the gold to the spur554 of the sea falcon. In like manner, the ray555of
light which has been commingled with the water, having obtained from discipline and instruction
its own proper locality, hastens towards the Logos that comes from above in servile
form; and along with the Logos exists as a logos in that place where the Logos is still: (the
light, I say, hastens to the Logos with greater speed) than the iron towards the magnet.</p>
<p>And that these things, he says, are so, and that all things that have been commingled
are separated in their proper places, learn. There is among the Persians in a city Ampa,556
near the river Tigris, a well; and near the well, at the top, has been constructed a certain
reservoir, supplied with three outlets; and when one pumps from this well, and draws off
some of its contents in a vessel, what is thus pumped out of the well, whatever it is at all, he
pours into the reservoir hard by. And when what is thus infused reaches the outlets, and
when what is taken up (out of each outlet) in a single vessel is examined, a separation is
observed to have taken place. And in the first of the outlets is exhibited a concretion of salt,
and in the second of asphalt, and in the third of oil; and the oil is black, just as, he says,
Herodotus557 also narrates, and it yields a heavy smell, and the Persians call this “rhadinace.”
The similitude of the well is, say the Sethians, more sufficient for the demonstration of their
proposition than all the statements that have been previously made.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The System of Justinus Antiscriptural and Essentially Pagan.</head>
<p>Justinus558 was entirely opposed to the teaching of the holy Scriptures, and moreover
to the written or oral teaching of the blessed evangelists, according as the Logos was accustomed
to instruct His disciples, saying, “Go not into the way of the Gentiles;”559 and this
signifies that they should not attend to the futile doctrine of the Gentiles. This (heretic) endeavours
to lead on his hearers into an acknowledgment of prodigies detailed by the Gentiles,
and of doctrines inculcated by them. And he narrates, word for word, legendary accounts
prevalent among the Greeks, and does not previously teach or deliver his perfect mystery,
unless he has bound his dupe by an oath. Then he brings forward (these) fables for the
purpose of persuasion, in order that they who are conversant with the incalculable trifling
of these books may have some consolation in the details of these legends. Thus it happens
as when in like manner one making a long journey deems it expedient, on having fallen in
with an inn, to take repose. And so it is that, when once more they are induced to turn towards
studying the diffuse doctrine of these lectures, they may not abhor them while they,
undergoing instruction unnecessarily prolix, rush stupified into the transgression devised
by (Justinus); and previously he binds his followers with horrible oaths, neither to publish
nor abjure these doctrines, and forces upon them an acknowledgment (of their truth). And
in this manner he delivers the mysteries impiously discovered by himself, partly, according
to the statements previously made, availing himself of the Hellenic legends, and partly of
those pretended books which, to some extent, bear a resemblance to the foresaid heresies.
For all, forced together by one spirit, are drawn into one profound abyss of pollution, inculcating
the same tenets, and detailing the same legends, each after a different method. All
those, however, style themselves Gnostics in this peculiar sense, that they alone themselves
have imbibed the marvellous knowledge of the Perfect and Good (Being).</p>
<note type="footnote">558 What Hippolytus here states respecting Justinus is quite new. No mention occurs of this heretic in ecclesiastical
history. It is evident, however, that, like Simon Magus, he was contemporary with St. Peter and St. Paul.
Justinus, however, and the Ophitic sect to which he belonged, are assigned by Hippolytus and Irenæus a prior
position as regards the order of their appearance to the system of Simon, or its offshoot Valentinianism. The
Ophites engrafted Phrygian Judaism, and the Valentinians Gentilism, upon Christianity; the former not rejecting
the speculations and mysteries of Asiatic paganism, and the latter availing themselves of the cabalistic corruptions
of Judaism. The Judaistic element soon became prominent in successive phases of Valentinianism, which produced
a fusion of the sects of the old Gnostics and of Simon. Hippolytus, however, now places the Ophitic sect before
us prior to its amalgamation with Valentinianism. Here, for the first time, we have an authentic delineation of
the primitive Ophites. This is of great value. [See Irenæus, vol. i., this series, p. 354; also Bunsen (on Baur), vol.
i. p. 42.]</note>

<head>Chapter XIX.—The Justinian Heresy Unfolded in the “Book of Baruch.”</head>
<p>But swear, says Justinus, if you wish to know “what eye hath not seen, and ear hath not
heard, and the things which have not entered into the heart;”560 that is, if you wish to know
Him who is good above all, Him who is more exalted, (swear) that you will preserve the
secrets (of the Justinian) discipline, as intended to be kept silent. For also our Father, on
beholding the Good One, and on being initiated with Him, preserved the mysteries respecting
which silence is enjoined, and sware, as it has been written, “The Lord sware, and will not
repent.”561 Having, then, in this way set the seal to these tenets, he seeks to inveigle (his
followers) with more legends, (which are detailed) through a greater number of books; and
so he conducts (his readers) to the Good One, consummating the initiated (by admitting
them into) the unspeakable Mysteries.562 In order, however, that we may not wade through
more of their volumes, we shall illustrate the ineffable Mysteries (of Justinus) from one book
of his, inasmuch as, according to his supposition, it is (a work) of high repute. Now this
volume is inscribed Baruch; and one fabulous account out of many which is explained by
(Justinus) in this (volume), we shall point out, inasmuch as it is to be found in Herodotus.
But after imparting a different shape to this (account), he explains it to his pupils as if it
were something novel, being under the impression that the entire arrangement of his doctrine

<head>Chapter XX.—The Cosmogony of Justinus an Allegorical Explanation of Herodotus’
Legend of Hercules.</head>
<p>Herodotus,563 then, asserts that Hercules, when driving the oxen of Geryon from
Erytheia,564 came into Scythia, and that, being wearied with travelling, he retired into some
desert spot and slept for a short time. But while he slumbered his horse disappeared, seated
on which he had performed his lengthened journey. On being aroused from repose, he,
however, instituted a diligent search through the desert, endeavouring to discover his horse.
And though he is unsuccessful in his search after the horse, he yet finds in the desert a certain
damsel, half of whose form was that of woman, and proceeded to question her if she had
seen the horse anywhere. The girl, however, replies that she had seen (the animal), but that
she would not show him unless Hercules previously would come along with her for the
purpose of sexual intercourse. Now Herodotus informs us that her upper parts as far as the
groin were those of a virgin, but that everything below the body after the groin presented
some horrible appearance of a snake. In anxiety, however, for the discovery of his horse,
Hercules complies with the monster’s request; for he knew her (carnally), and made her
pregnant. And he foretold, after coition, that she had by him in her womb three children at
the same time, who were destined to become illustrious. And he ordered that she, on
bringing forth, should impose on the children as soon as born the following names: Agathyrsus,
Gelonus, and Scytha. And as the reward of this (favour) receiving his horse from
the beast-like damsel, he went on his way, taking with him the cattle also. But after these
(details), Herodotus has a protracted account; adieu, however, to it for the present.565 But
what the opinions are of Justinus, who transfers this legend into (his account of) the generation
of the universe, we shall explain.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Justinus’ Triad of Principles; His Angelography Founded on This
Triad; His Explanation of the Birth, Life, and Death of Our Lord.</head>
<p>This (heresiarch) makes the following statement. There are three unbegotten principles
of the universe, two male (and) one female. Of the male (principles), however, a certain one,
is denominated good, and it alone is called after this manner, and possesses a power of
prescience concerning the universe. But the other is father566 of all begotten things, devoid
of prescience,567 and invisible. And the female (principle) is devoid of prescience, passionate,
two-minded,568 two-bodied, in every respect answering (the description of) the girl in the
legend of Herodotus, as far as the groin a virgin, and (in) the parts below (resembling) a
snake, as Justinus says. But this girl is styled Edem and Israel. And these principles of the
universe are, he says, roots and fountains from which existing things have been produced,
but that there was not anything else. The Father, then, who is devoid of prescience, beholding
that half-woman Edem, passed into a concupiscent desire for her. But this Father, he says,
is called Elohim. Not less did Edem also long for Elohim, and the mutual passion brought
them together into the one nuptial couch of love.569 And from such an intercourse the
Father generates out of Edem unto himself twelve angels. And the names of the angels begotten
by the Father are these: Michaël, Amen,570 Baruch, Gabriel, Esaddæus.…And of the
maternal angels which Edem brought forth, the names in like manner have been subjoined,
and they are as follows: Babel,571 Achamoth, Naas, Bel, Belias, Satan, Saël, Adonæus, Leviathan,
572 Pharao, Carcamenos, (and) Lathen.</p>
<p>Of these twenty-four angels the paternal ones are associated with the Father, and do all
things according to His will; and the maternal (angels are associated with) Edem the
Mother. And the multitude of all these angels together is Paradise, he says, concerning
which Moses speaks: “God planted a garden in Eden towards the east,”573 that is, towards
the face of Edem, that Edem might behold the garden—that is, the angels—continually.
Allegorically the angels are styled trees of this garden, and the tree of life is the third of the
paternal angels—Baruch. And the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the third of the

maternal angels—Naas. For so,574 says (Justinus), one ought to interpret the words of Moses,
observing, “Moses said these things disguisedly, from the fact that all do not attain the truth.”
And, he says, Paradise being formed from the conjugal joy of Elohim and Edem, the angels
of Elohim receiving from the most beauteous earth, that is, not from the portion of Edem
resembling a monster, but from the parts above the groin of human shape, and gentle—in
aspect,—make man out of the earth. But out of the parts resembling a monster are produced
wild beasts, and the rest of the animal creation. They made man, therefore, as a symbol of
the unity and love (subsisting) between them; and they depute their own powers unto him,
Edem the soul, but Elohim the spirit. And the man Adam is produced as some actual seal
and memento of love, and as an everlasting emblem of the marriage of Edem and Elohim.
And in like manner also Eve was produced, he says, as Moses has described, an image and
emblem (as well as) a seal, to be preserved for ever, of Edem. And in like manner also a soul
was deposited in Eve,—an image—from Edem, but a spirit from Elohim. And there were
given to them commandments, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,”575 that
is, Edem; for so he wishes that it had been written. For the entire of the power belonging
unto herself, Edem conferred upon Elohim as a sort of nuptial dowry. Whence, he says,
from imitation of that primary marriage up to this day, women bring a dowry to their husbands,
complying with a certain divine and paternal law that came into existence on the
part of Edem towards Elohim.</p>
<p>And when all things were created as has been described by Moses—both heaven and
earth, and the things therein576—the twelve angels of the Mother were divided into four
principles, and each fourth part of them is called a river—Phison, and Gehon, and Tigris,
and Euphrates, as, he says, Moses states. These twelve angels, being mutually connected, go
about into four parts, and manage the world, holding from Edem a sort of viceregal577 authority
over the world. But they do not always continue in the same places, but move around
as if in a circular dance, changing place after place, and at set times and intervals retiring to
the localities subject to themselves. And when Phison holds sway over places, famine, distress,
and affliction prevail in that part of the earth, for the battalion of these angels is niggardly.
In like manner also there belong to each part of the four, according to the power and nature
of each, evil times and hosts of diseases. And continually, according to the dominion578 of
each fourth part, this stream of evil, just (like a current) of rivers, careers, according to the

<pb n="182"/>
will of Edem, uninterruptedly around the world. And from some cause of this description
has arisen the necessity of evil.</p>
<p>When Elohim had prepared and created the world as a result from joint pleasure, He
wished to ascend up to the elevated parts of heaven, and to see that not anything of what
pertained to the creation laboured under deficiency. And He took His Own angels with
Him, for His nature was to mount aloft, leaving Edem below:579 for inasmuch as she was
earth, she was not disposed to follow upward her spouse. Elohim, then, coming to the highest
part of heaven above, and beholding a light superior to that which He Himself had created,
exclaimed, “Open me the gates, that entering in I may acknowledge the Lord; for I considered
Myself to be Lord.”580 A voice was returned to Him from the light, saying, “This is the gate
of the Lord: through this the righteous enter in.”581 And immediately the gate was opened,
and the Father, without the angels, entered, (advancing) towards the Good One, and beheld
“what eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and what hath not entered into the heart
of man to (conceive).”582 Then the Good One says to him, “Sit thou on my right hand.”583
And the Father says to the Good One, “Permit me, Lord, to overturn the world which I have
made, for my spirit is bound to men.584 And I wish to receive it back (from them.” Then
the Good One replies to him, “No evil canst thou do while thou art with me, for both thou
and Edem made the world as a result of conjugal joy. Permit Edem, then, to hold possession
of the world as long as she wishes; but do you remain with me.” Then Edem, knowing that
she had been deserted by Elohim, was seized with grief, and placed beside herself her own
angels. And she adorned herself after a comely fashion, if by any means Elohim, passing
into concupiscent desire, might descend (from heaven) to her.</p>
<p>When, however, Elohim, overpowered by the Good One, no longer descended to Edem,
Edem commanded Babel, which is Venus, to cause adulteries and dissolutions of marriages
among men. (And she adopted this expedient) in order that, as she had been divorced from
Elohim, so also the spirit of Elohim, which is in men, being wrong with sorrow, might be
punished by such separations, and might undergo precisely the sufferings which (were being
endured by) the deserted Edem. And Edem gives great power to her third angel, Naas, that
by every species of punishment she might chasten the spirit of Elohim which is in men, in
order that Elohim, through the spirit, might be punished for having deserted his spouse, in
violation of the agreements entered into between them. Elohim the father, seeing these

things, sends forth Baruch, the third angel among his own, to succour the spirit that is in
all men.585 Baruch then coming, stood in the midst of the angels of Edem, that is, in the
midst of paradise—for paradise is the angels, in the midst of whom he stood,—and issued
to the man the following injunction: “Of every tree that is in paradise thou mayest freely
eat, but thou mayest not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,”586 which is Naas.
Now the meaning is, that he should obey the rest of the eleven angels of Edem, for the eleven
possess passions, but are not guilty of transgression. Naas, however, has committed sin, for
he went in unto Eve, deceiving her, and debauched her; and (such an act as) this is a violation
of law. He, however, likewise went in unto Adam, and had unnatural intercourse with him;
and this is itself also a piece of turpitude, whence have arisen adultery and sodomy.</p>
<p>Henceforward vice and virtue were prevalent among men, arising from a single
source—that of the Father. For the Father having ascended to the Good One, points out
from time to time the way to those desirous of ascending (to him likewise). After having,
however, departed from Edem, he caused an originating principle of evil for the spirit of
the Father that is in men.587 Baruch therefore was despatched to Moses, and through him
spoke to the children of Israel, that they might be converted unto the Good One. But the
third angel (Naas), by the soul which came from Edem upon Moses, as also upon all men,
obscured the precepts of Baruch, and caused his own peculiar injunctions to be hearkened
unto. For this reason the soul is arrayed against the spirit, and the spirit against the soul.588
For the soul is Edem, but the spirit Elohim, and each of these exists in all men, both females
and males. Again, after these (occurrences), Baruch was sent to the Prophets, that through
the Prophets the spirit that dwelleth in men589 might hear (words of warning), and might
avoid Edem and the wicked fiction, just as the Father had fled from Elohim. In like manner
also—by the prophets590—Naas, by a similar device, through the soul591 that dwells in man,
along with the spirit of the Father, enticed away the prophets, and all (of them) were allured
after him, and did not follow the words of Baruch, which Elohim enjoined.</p>
<p>Ultimately Elohim selected Hercules, an uncircumcised prophet, and sent him to quell
the twelve angels of Edem, and release the Father from the twelve angels, those wicked ones
of the creation. These are the twelve conflicts of Hercules which Hercules underwent, in
order, from first to last, viz., Lion, and Hydra, and Boar, and the others successively. For

they say that these are the names (of them) among the Gentiles, and they have been derived
with altered denominations from the energy of the maternal angels. When he seemed to
have vanquished his antagonists, Omphale—now she is Babel or Venus—clings to him and
entices away Hercules, and divests him of his power, viz., the commands of Baruch which
Elohim issued. And in place (of this power, Babel) envelopes him in her own peculiar robe,
that is, in the power of Edem, who is the power below; and in this way the prophecy of
Hercules remained unfulfilled, and his works.</p>
<p>Finally, however, in the days of Herod the king, Baruch is despatched, being sent down
once more by Elohim; and coming to Nazareth, he found Jesus, son of Joseph and Mary, a
child of twelve years, feeding sheep. And he announces to him all things from the beginning,
whatsoever had been done by Edem and Elohim, and whatsoever would be likely to take
place hereafter, and spoke the following words: “All the prophets anterior to you have been
enticed. Put forth an effort, therefore, Jesus, Son of man, not to be allured, but preach this
word unto men, and carry back tidings to them of things pertaining to the Father, and things
pertaining to the Good One, and ascend to the Good One, and sit there with Elohim, Father
of us all.” And Jesus was obedient unto the angel, saying that, “I shall do all things, Lord,”
and proceeded to preach. Naas therefore wished to entice this one also. (Jesus, however,
was not disposed to listen to his overtures592), for he remained faithful to Baruch. Therefore
Naas, being inflamed with anger because he was not able to seduce him, caused him to be
crucified. He, however, leaving the body of Edem on the (accursed) tree, ascended to the
Good One; saying, however, to Edem, “Woman, thou retainest thy son,”593 that is, the natural
and the earthly man. But (Jesus) himself commending his spirit into the hands of the
Father, ascended to the Good One. Now the Good One is Priapus, (and) he it is who antecedently
caused the production of everything that exists. On this account he is styled Priapus,
because he previously fashioned all things (according to his own design). For this reason,
he says, in every temple is placed his statue, which is revered by every creature; and (there
are images of him) in the highways, carrying over his head ripened fruits, that is, the produce
of the creation, of which he is the cause, having in the first instance formed, (according to
His own design), the creation, when as yet it had no existence. When, therefore, he says,
you hear men asserting that the swan went in unto Leda, and begat a child from her, (learn
that) the swan is Elohim, and Leda Edem. And when people allege that an eagle went in
unto Ganymede, (know that) the eagle is Naas, and Ganymede Adam. And when they assert
that gold (in a shower) went in unto Danaë and begat a child from her, (recollect that) the
gold is Elohim, and Danaë is Edem. And similarly, in the same manner adducing all accounts
of this description, which correspond with (the nature of) legends, they pursue the work of

instruction. When, therefore, the prophet says, “Hearken, O heaven, and give ear, O earth;
the Lord hath spoken,” he means by heaven, (Justinus) says, the spirit which is in man from
Elohim; and by earth, the soul which is in man along with the spirit; and by Lord, Baruch;
and by Israel, Edem, for Israel as well as Edem is called the spouse of Elohim. “Israel,” he
says, “did not know me (Elohim); for had he known me, that I am with the Good One, he
would not have punished through paternal ignorance the spirit which is in men.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Oath Used by the Justinian Heretics; The Book of Baruch; The
Repertory of Their System.</head>
<p>Hence594 also, in the first book inscribed “Baruch,” has been written the oath which
they compel those to swear who are about to hear these mysteries, and be initiated with the
Good One.595 And this oath, (Justinus) says, our Father Elohim sware when He was beside
the Good One, and having sworn He did not repent (of the oath), respecting which, he says,
it has been written, “The Lord sware, and will not repent.”596 Now the oath is couched in
these597 terms: “I swear by that Good One who is above all, to guard these mysteries, and
to divulge them to no one, and not to relapse from the Good One to the creature.” And
when he has sworn this oath, he goes on to the Good One, and beholds “whatever things
eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and which have not entered into the heart of
man;”598 and he drinks from life-giving water, which is to them, as they suppose, a bath,599
a fountain of life-giving, bubbling water.600 For there has been a separation made between
water and water; and there is water, that below the firmament of the wicked creation, in
which earthly and animal men are washed; and there is life-giving water, (that) above the
firmament,601 of the Good One, in which spiritual (and) living men are washed; and in this
Elohim washed Himself. and having washed did not repent. And when, he says, the prophet
affirms, “Take unto yourself a wife of whoredom, since the earth has abandoned itself to
fornication, (departing) from (following) after the Lord;”602 that is, Edem (departs) from
Elohim. (Now) in these words, he says, the prophet clearly declares the entire mystery, and
is not hearkened unto by reason of the wicked machinations of Naas. According to that
same manner, they deliver other prophetical passages in a similar spirit of interpretation
throughout numerous books. The volume, however, inscribed “Baruch,” is pre-eminently

<p>It seems, then, expedient likewise to explain now the opinions of Simon,610 a native of
Gitta, a village of Samaria; and we shall also prove that his successors, taking a starting-point
from him, have endeavoured (to establish) similar opinions under a change of name. This
Simon being an adept in sorceries, both making a mockery of many, partly according to the
art of Thrasymedes, in the manner in which we have explained above,611 and partly also by
the assistance of demons perpetrating his villany, attempted to deify himself. (But) the man
was a (mere) cheat, and full of folly, and the Apostles reproved him in the Acts.612 With
much greater wisdom and moderation than Simon, did Apsethus the Libyan, inflamed with
a similar wish, endeavour to have himself considered a god in Libya. And inasmuch as his
legendary system does not present any wide divergence from the inordinate desire of that
silly Simon, it seems expedient to furnish an explanation of it, as one worthy of the attempt
made by this man.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Story of Apsethus the Libyan.</head>
<p>Apsethus613 the Libyan inordinately longed to become a god; but when, after repeated
intrigues, he altogether failed to accomplish his desire, he nevertheless wished to appear to
have become a god; and he did at all events appear, as time wore on, to have in reality become
a god. For the foolish Libyans were accustomed to sacrifice unto him as to some divine
power, supposing that they were yielding credence to a voice that came down from above,
from heaven. For, collecting into one and the same cage a great number of birds,—parrots,—
he shut them up. Now there are very many parrots throughout Libya, and very distinctly
these imitate the human voice. This man, having for a time nourished the birds, was
in the habit of teaching them to say, “Apsethus is a god.” After, however, the birds had
practised this for a long period, and were accustomed to the utterance of that which he
thought, when said, would make it supposed that Apsethus was a god, then, opening the
habitation (of the birds), he let forth the parrots, each in a different direction. While the
birds, however, were on the wing, their sound went out into all Libya, and the expressions
of these reached as far as the Hellenic country. And thus the Libyans, being astonished at
the voice of the birds, and not perceiving the knavery perpetrated by Apsethus, held Apsethus
to be a god. Some one, however, of the Greeks, by accurate examination, perceiving the trick
of the supposed god, by means of those same parrots not only refutes, but also utterly destroys,
that boastful and tiresome fellow. Now the Greek, by confining many of the parrots,
taught them anew to say, “Apsethus, having caged us, compelled us to say, Apsethus is a
god.” But having heard of the recantation of the parrots, the Libyans, coming together, all
unanimously decided on burning Apsethus.</p>
<note type="footnote">613 Miller refers us to Apostolius’ Proverb., s.v. ψαφῶν. Schneidewin remarks that Maximus Tyrius relates
almost a similar story concerning one Psapho, a Libyan, in his Dissert. (xxxv.), and that Apostolius extracted
this account and inserted it in his Cent., xviii. p. 730, ed. Leutsch, mentioning at the same time a similar narrative
from Ælian’s Hist., xiv. 30. See Justin., xxi. 4, and Pliny, Nat. Hist., viii. 16.</note>

<head>Chapter IV.—Simon’s Forced Interpretation of Scripture; Plagiarizes from Heraclitus
and Aristotle; Simon’s System of Sensible and Intelligible Existences.</head>
<p>In this way we must think concerning Simon the magician, so that we may compare
him unto the Libyan, far sooner than unto Him who, though made man,614 was in reality
God. If, however, the assertion of this likeness is in itself accurate, and the sorcerer was the
subject of a passion similar to Apsethus, let us endeavour to teach anew the parrots of Simon,
that Christ, who stood, stands, and will stand, (that is, was, is, and is to come,) was not Simon.
But (Jesus) was man, offspring of the seed of a woman, born of blood and the will of the
flesh, as also the rest (of humanity). And that these things are so, we shall easily prove as
the discussion proceeds.</p>
<p>Now Simon, both foolishly and knavishly paraphrasing the law of Moses, makes his
statements (in the manner following): For when Moses asserts that “God is a burning and
consuming fire,”615 taking what is said by Moses not in its correct sense, he affirms that fire
is the originating principle of the universe. (But Simon) does not consider what the statement
is which is made, namely, that it is not that God is a fire, but a burning and consuming fire,
(thereby) not only putting a violent sense upon the actual law of Moses, but even plagiarizing
from Heraclitus the Obscure. And Simon denominates the originating principle of the
universe an indefinite power, expressing himself thus: “This is the treatise of a revelation of
(the) voice and name (recognisable) by means of intellectual apprehension of the Great Indefinite
Power. Wherefore it will be sealed, (and) kept secret, (and) hid, (and) will repose
in the habitation, at the foundation of which lies the root of all things.” And he asserts that
this man who is born of blood is (the aforesaid) habitation, and that in him resides an indefinite
power, which he affirms to be the root of the universe.</p>
<p>Now the indefinite power which is fire, constitutes, according to Simon, not any uncompounded
(essence, in conformity with the opinion of those who) assert that the four elements
are simple, and who have (therefore) likewise imagined that fire, (which is one of the four,)
is simple. But (this is far from being the case): for there is, (he maintains,) a certain twofold
nature of fire;616 and of this twofold (nature) he denominates one part a something secret,
and another a something manifest, and that the secret are hidden in the manifest portions
of the fire, and that the manifest portions of the fire derive their being from its secret (portions).
This, however, is what Aristotle denominates by (the expressions) “potentiality” and
“energy,” or (what) Plato (styles) “intelligible” and “sensible.” And the manifest portion of
the fire comprises all things in itself, whatsoever any one might discern, or even whatever

objects of the visible creation617 he may happen to overlook. But the entire secret (portion
of the fire) which one may discern is cognised by intellect, and evades the power of the
senses; or one fails to observe it, from want of a capacity for that particular sort of perception.
In general, however, inasmuch as all existing things fall under the categories, namely, of
what are objects of Sense, and what are objects of Intellect, and as for the denomination of
these (Simon) employs the terms secret and manifest; it may, (I say, in general,) be affirmed
that the fire, (I mean) the super-celestial (fire), is a treasure, as it were a large tree, just such
a one as in a dream was seen by Nabuchodonosor,618 out of which all flesh is nourished.
And the manifest portion of the fire he regards as the stem, the branches, the leaves, (and)
the external rind which overlaps them. All these (appendages), he says, of the Great Tree
being kindled, are made to disappear by reason of the blaze of the all-devouring fire. The
fruit, however, of the tree, when it is fully grown, and has received its own form, is deposited
in a granary, not (flung) into the fire. For, he says, the fruit has been produced for the purpose
of being laid in the storehouse, whereas the chaff that it may be delivered over to the fire.619
(Now the chaff) is stem, (and is) generated not for its own sake, but for that of the fruit.</p>

the man of Judah (is) the beloved plant, it has been proved, he says, that there is not any
other tree but that man. But concerning the secretion and dissolution of this (tree), Scripture,
he says, has spoken sufficiently. And as regards instruction for those who have been fashioned
after the image (of him), that statement is enough which is made (in Scripture), that “all
flesh is grass, and all the glory of flesh, as it were, a flower of grass. The grass withereth, and
its flower falleth; but the word of the Lord abideth for ever.”620 The word of the Lord, he
says, is that word which is produced in the mouth, and (is) a Logos, but nowhere else exists

such a manner as Empedocles621 speaks of:—

<head>Chapter VII.—Simon’s System of a Threefold Emanation by Pairs.</head>
<p>For, he says, he is in the habit of considering that all these portions of the fire, both
visible and invisible, are possessed of perception and a share of intelligence.622 The world,
therefore, that which is generated, was produced from the unbegotten fire. It began, however,
to exist, he says, according to the following manner. He who was begotten from the principle
of that fire took six roots, and those primary ones, of the originating principle of generation.
And, he says that the roots were made from the fire in pairs, which roots he terms “Mind”
and “Intelligence,” “Voice” and “Name,” “Ratiocination” and “Reflection.” And that in these
six roots resides simultaneously the entire indefinite power potentially, (however) not actually.
And this indefinite power, he says, is he who stood, stands, and will stand. Wherefore,
whensoever he may be made into an image, inasmuch as he exists in the six powers, he will
exist (there) substantially, potentially, quantitively, (and) completely. (And he will be a
power) one and the same with the unbegotten and indefinite power, and not labouring under
any greater deficiency than that unbegotten and unalterable (and) indefinite power. If,
however, he may continue only potentially in the six powers, and has not been formed into
an image, he vanishes, he says, and is destroyed in such a way as the grammatical or geometrical
capacity in man’s soul. For when the capacity takes unto itself an art, a light of existent
things is produced; but when (the capacity) does not take unto itself (an art), unskilfulness
and ignorance are the results; and just as when (the power) was non-existent, it perishes
along with the expiring man.</p>

<p>And of those six powers,623 and of the seventh which co-exists with them, the first pair,
Mind and Intelligence, he calls Heaven and Earth. And that one of these, being of male sex,
beholds from above and takes care of his partner, but that the earth receives below the rational
fruits, akin to the earth, which are borne down from the heaven. On this account, he
says, the Logos, frequently looking towards the things that are being generated from Mind
and Intelligence, that is, from Heaven and Earth, exclaims, “Hear, O heaven, and give ear,
O earth, because the Lord has spoken. I have brought forth children, and exalted them; and
these have rejected me.” Now, he who utters these words, he says, is the seventh power—he
who stood, stands, and will stand; for he himself is cause of those beauteous objects of creation
which Moses commended, and said that they were very good. But Voice and Name (the
second of the three pairs) are Sun and Moon; and Ratiocination and Reflection (the third
of the three pairs) are Air and Water. And in all these is intermingled and blended, as I have
declared, the great, the indefinite, the (self-) existing power.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Simon’s Interpretation of the Mosaic Hexaëmeron; His Allegorical
Representation of Paradise.</head>
<p>When, therefore, Moses has spoken of “the six days in which God made heaven and
earth, and rested on the seventh from all His works,”624 Simon, in a manner already specified,
giving (these and other passages of Scripture) a different application (from the one intended
by the holy writers), deifies himself. When, therefore, (the followers of Simon) affirm that
there are three days begotten before sun and moon, they speak enigmatically of Mind and
Intelligence, that is, Heaven and Earth, and of the seventh power, (I mean) the indefinite
one. For these three powers are produced antecedent to all the rest. But when they say, “He
begot me prior to all the Ages,”625 such statements, he says, are alleged to hold good concerning
the seventh power. Now this seventh power, which was a power existing in the indefinite
power, which was produced prior to all the Ages, this is, he says, the seventh power,
respecting which Moses utters the following words: “And the Spirit of God was wafted
over626 the water;” that is, says (the Simonian), the Spirit which contains all things in itself,
and is an image of the indefinite power about which Simon speaks,—“an image from an
incorruptible form, that alone reduces all things into order.” For this power that is wafted
over the water, being begotten, he says, from an incorruptible form alone, reduces all things
into order. When, therefore, according to these (heretics), there ensued some such arrangement,
and (one) similar (to it) of the world, the Deity, he says, proceeded to form man,
taking clay from the earth. And He formed him not uncompounded, but twofold, according
to (His own) image and likeness.627 Now the image is the Spirit that is wafted over the water;
and whosoever is not fashioned into a figure of this, will perish with the world, inasmuch
as he continues only potentially, and does exist actually. This, he says, is what has been

into the figure of (the Spirit), and be generated from an indivisible point, as it has been
written in the Announcement, (such a one, albeit) small, will become great. But what is great

<p>How then, he says, and in what manner, does God form man? In Paradise; for so it
seems to him. Grant Paradise, he says, to be the womb; and that this is a true (assumption)

womb.”629 For this also he wishes to have been written so. Moses, he says, resorting to allegory,
has declared Paradise to be the womb, if we ought to rely on his statement. If,
however, God forms man in his mother’s womb—that is, in Paradise—as I have affirmed,
let Paradise be the womb, and Edem the after-birth,630 “a river flowing forth from Edem,
for the purpose of irrigating Paradise,”631 (meaning by this) the navel. This navel, he says,
is separated into four principles; for on either side of the navel are situated two arteries,
channels of spirit, and two veins, channels of blood. But when, he says, the umbilical vessels632
proceed forth from Edem, that is, the caul in which the foetus is enveloped grows
into the (foetus) that is being formed in the vicinity of the epigastrium,—(now) all in common
denominate this a navel,—these two veins through which the blood flows, and is conveyed
from Edem, the after-birth, to what are styled the gates of the liver; (these veins, I say,)
nourish the foetus. But the arteries which we have spoken of as being channels of spirit,
embrace the bladder on both sides, around the pelvis, and connect it with the great artery,
called the aorta, in the vicinity of the dorsal ridge. And in this way the spirit, making its way
through the ventricles to the heart, produces a movement of the foetus. For the infant that
was formed in Paradise neither receives nourishment through the mouth, nor breathes
through the nostrils: for as it lay in the midst of moisture, at its feet was death, if it attempted
to breathe; for it would (thus) have been drawn away from moisture, and perished (accord-
ingly). But (one may go further than this); for the entire (foetus) is bound tightly round by
a covering styled the caul, and is nourished by a navel, and it receives through the (aorta),
in the vicinity of the dorsal ridge, as I have stated, the substance of the spirit.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Simon’s Explanation of the First Two Books of Moses.</head>
<p>The river, therefore, he says, which proceeds out of Edem is divided into four principles,
four channels—that is, into four senses, belonging to the creature that is being born, viz.,
seeing, smelling, taste, and touch; for the child formed in Paradise has these senses only.
This, he says, is the law which Moses appointed; and in reference to this very law, each of
his books has been written, as the inscriptions evince. The first book is Genesis. The inscription
of the book is, he says, sufficient for a knowledge of the universe. For this is (equivalent
in meaning with) generation, (that is,) vision, into which one section of the river is divided.
For the world was seen by the power of vision. Again, the inscription of the second book is
Exodus. For what has been produced, passing through the Red Sea, must come into the
wilderness,—now they say he calls the Red (Sea) blood,—and taste bitter water. For bitter,
he says, is the water which is (drunk) after (crossing) the Red Sea; which (water) is a path
to be trodden, that leads (us) to a knowledge in (this) life of (our) toilsome and bitter lot.
Altered, however, by Moses—that is, by the Logos—that bitter (water) becomes sweet. And
that this is so we may hear in common from all who express themselves according to the
(sentiments of the) poets:—
<lg>
<l>“Dark at the root, like milk, the flower,</l>
<l>Gods call it ‘Moly,’ and hard for mortal men</l>
<l>To dig, but power divine is boundless.”633</l>

<head>Chapter XI.—Simon’s Explanation of the Three Last Books of the Pentateuch.</head>
<p>What is spoken by the Gentiles is sufficient for a knowledge of the universe to those
who have ears (capable) of hearing. For whosoever, he says, has tasted this fruit, is not the
only one that is changed by Circe into a beast; but also, employing the power of such a fruit,
he forms anew and moulds afresh, and re-entices into that primary peculiar character of
theirs, those that already have been altered into beasts. But a faithful man, and beloved by
that sorceress, is, he says, discovered through that milk-like and divine fruit. In like manner,
the third book is Leviticus, which is smelling, or respiration. For the entire of that book is
(an account) of sacrifices and offerings. Where, however, there is a sacrifice, a certain savour
of the fragrance arises from the sacrifice through the incense-offerings; and in regard of this
fragrance (the sense of) smelling is a test. Numbers, the fourth of the books, signifies taste,
where the discourse is operative. For, from the fact of its speaking all things, it is denominated
by numerical arrangement. But Deuteronomy, he says, is written in reference to the (sense
of) touch possessed by the child that is being formed. For as touch, by seizing the things
that are seen by the other senses, sums them up and ratifies them, testing what is rough, or
warm, or clammy, (or cold); so the fifth book of the law constitutes a summary of the four
books preceding this.</p>
<p>All things, therefore, he says, when unbegotten, are in us potentially, not actually, as
the grammatical or geometrical (art). If, then, one receives proper instruction and teaching,
and (where consequently) what is bitter will be altered into what is sweet,—that is, the spears
into pruning-hooks, and the swords into plough-shares,634—there will not be chaff and
wood begotten for fire, but mature fruit, fully formed, as I said, equal and similar to the
unbegotten and indefinite power. If, however, a tree continues alone, not producing fruit
fully formed, it is utterly destroyed. For somewhere near, he says, is the axe (which is laid)
at the roots of the tree. Every tree, he says, which does not produce good fruit, is hewn down
and cast into fire.635</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Fire a Primal Principle, According to Simon.</head>
<p>According to Simon, therefore, there exists that which is blessed and incorruptible in
a latent condition in every one—(that is,) potentially, not actually; and that this is He who
stood, stands,636 and is to stand.637 He has stood above in unbegotten power. He stands
below, when in the stream of waters He was begotten in a likeness. He is to stand above,
beside the blessed indefinite power, if He be fashioned into an image. For, he says, there are
three who have stood; and except there were three Æons who have stood, the unbegotten
one is not adorned. (Now the unbegotten one) is, according to them, wafted over the water,
and is re-made, according to the similitude (of an eternal nature), a perfect celestial (being),
in no (quality of) intelligence formed inferior to the unbegotten power: that is what they
say—I and you, one; you, before me; I, that which is after you. This, he says, is one power
divided above (and) below, generating itself, making itself grow, seeking itself, finding itself,
being mother of itself, father of itself, sister of itself, spouse of itself, daughter of itself, son
of itself, mother, father, a unit, being a root of the entire circle of existence.</p>
<p>And that, he says, the originating principle of the generation of things begotten is from
fire, he discerns after some such method as the following. Of all things, (i.e.) of whatsoever
there is a generation, the beginning of the desire of the generation is from fire. Wherefore
the desire after mutable generation is denominated “to be inflamed.” For when the fire is
one, it admits of two conversions. For, he says, blood in the man being both warm and yellow,
is converted as a figured flame into seed; but in the woman this same blood is converted
into milk. And the conversion of the male becomes generation, but the conversion of the
female nourishment for the foetus. This, he says, is “the flaming sword, which turned to
guard the way of the tree of life.”638 For the blood is converted into seed and milk, and this
power becomes mother and father—father of those things that are in process of generation,
and the augmentation of those things that are being nourished; (and this power is) without
further want, (and) self-sufficient. And, he says, the tree of life is guarded, as we have stated,
by the brandished flaming sword. And it is the seventh power, that which (is produced)
<note type="footnote">636 In the Recognitions of Clement we have this passage: “He (Simon) wishes himself to be believed to be an

The Recognitions of Clement explain the term thus: “He (Simon) uses this name as implying that he can never
be dissolved, asserting that his flesh is so compacted by the power of his divinity, that it can endure to eternity.
Hence, therefore, he is called the standing one, as though he cannot fall by any corruption” (Ante-Nicene Library,

the flaming sword be not brandished, that good tree will be destroyed, and perish. If, however,
these be converted into seed and milk, the principle that resides in these potentially, and is
in possession of a proper position, in which is evolved a principle of souls, (such a principle,)
beginning, as it were, from a very small spark, will be altogether magnified, and will increase
and become a power indefinite (and) unalterable, (equal and similar) to an unalterable age,

<head>Chapter XIII.—His Doctrine of Emanation Further Expanded.</head>
<p>Therefore, according to this reasoning, Simon became confessedly a god to his silly
followers, as that Libyan, namely, Apsethus—begotten, no doubt, and subject to passion,
when he may exist potentially, but devoid of propensions. (And this too, though born from
one having propensions, and uncreated though born) from one that is begotten, when He
may be fashioned into a figure, and, becoming perfect, may come forth from two of the
primary powers, that is, Heaven and Earth. For Simon expressly speaks of this in the “Revelation”
after this manner: “To you, then, I address the things which I speak, and (to you)
I write what I write. The writing is this: there are two offshoots from all the Æons, having
neither beginning nor end, from one root. And this is a power, viz., Sige, (who is) invisible
(and) incomprehensible. And one of these (offshoots) appears from above, which constitutes
a great power, (the creative) Mind of the universe, which manages all things, (and is) a male.
The other (offshoot), however, is from below, (and constitutes) a great Intelligence, and is
a female which produces all things. From whence, ranged in pairs opposite each other, they
undergo conjugal union, and manifest an intermediate interval, namely, an incomprehensible
air, which has neither beginning nor end. But in this is a father who sustains all things, and
nourishes things that have beginning and end. This is he who stood, stands, and will stand,
being an hermaphrodite power according to the pre-existent indefinite power, which has
neither beginning nor end. Now this (power) exists in isolation. For Intelligence, (that
subsists) in unity, proceeded forth from this (power), (and) became two. And that (father)
was one, for having in himself this (power) he was isolated, and, however, He was not
primal though pre-existent; but being rendered manifest to himself from himself, he passed
into a state of duality. But neither was he denominated father before this (power) would
style him father. As, therefore, he himself, bringing forward himself by means of himself,
manifested unto himself his own peculiar intelligence, so also the intelligence, when it was
manifested, did not exercise the function of creation. But beholding him, she concealed the
Father within herself, that is, the power; and it is an hermaphrodite power, and an intelligence.
And hence it is that they are ranged in pairs, one opposite the other; for power is in
no wise different from intelligence, inasmuch as they are one. For from those things that
are above is discovered power; and from those below, intelligence. So it is, therefore, that
likewise what is manifested from these, being unity, is discovered (to be) duality, an hermaphrodite
having the female in itself. This, (therefore,) is Mind (subsisting) in Intelligence;
and these are separable one from the other, (though both taken together) are one, (and) are
discovered in a state of duality.”</p>

Apology for Their Vice.</head>
<p>Simon then, after inventing these (tenets), not only by evil devices interpreted the
writings of Moses in whatever way he wished, but even the (works) of the poets.639 For also
he fastens an allegorical meaning on (the story of) the wooden horse and Helen with the
torch, and on very many other (accounts), which he transfers to what relates to himself and
to Intelligence, and (thus) furnishes a fictitious explanation of them. He said, however, that
this (Helen) was the lost sheep. And she, always abiding among women, confounded the
powers in the world by reason of her surpassing beauty. Whence, likewise, the Trojan war
arose on her account. For in the Helen born at that time resided this Intelligence; and thus,
when all the powers were for claiming her (for themselves), sedition and war arose, during
which (this chief power) was manifested to nations. And from this circumstance, without
doubt, we may believe that Stesichorus, who had through (some) verses reviled her, was
deprived of the use of his eyes; and that, again, when he repented and composed recantations,
in which he sung (Helen’s) praises, he recovered the power of vision. But the angels and the
powers below—who, he says, created the world—caused the transference from one body to
another of (Helen’s soul); and subsequently she stood on the roof of a house in Tyre, a city
of Phoenicia, and on going down thither (Simon professed to have) found her. For he stated
that, principally for the purpose of searching after this (woman), he had arrived (in Tyre),
in order that he might rescue her from bondage. And after having thus redeemed her, he
was in the habit of conducting her about with himself, alleging that this (girl) was the lost
sheep, and affirming himself to be the Power above all things. But the filthy640 fellow, becoming
enamoured of this miserable woman called Helen, purchased her (as his slave), and
enjoyed her person.641 He, (however,) was likewise moved with shame towards his disciples,
and concocted this figment.</p>
<p>But, again, those who become followers of this impostor—I mean Simon the sorcerer—
indulge in similar practices, and irrationally allege the necessity of promiscuous intercourse.

no difference where any one sows, provided he does sow.” But even they congratulate
themselves on account of this indiscriminate intercourse, asserting that this is perfect love,
and employing the expressions, “holy of holies,” and “sanctify one another.”642 For (they
would have us believe) that they are not overcome by the supposed vice, for that they have
been redeemed. “And (Jesus), by having redeemed Helen in this way,” (Simon says,) “has
afforded salvation to men through his own peculiar intelligence. For inasmuch as the angels,
by reason of their lust for pre-eminence, improperly managed the world, (Jesus Christ) being
transformed, and being assimilated to the rulers and powers and angels, came for the restoration
(of things). And so (it was that Jesus) appeared as man, when in reality he was not a
man. And (so it was) that likewise he suffered—though not actually undergoing suffering,
but appearing to the Jews to do so643—in Judea as ‘Son,’ and in Samaria as ‘Father,’644 and
among the rest of the Gentiles as ‘Holy Spirit.’” And (Simon alleges) that Jesus tolerated
being styled by whichever name (of the three just mentioned) men might wish to call him.
“And that the prophets, deriving their inspiration from the world-making angels, uttered
predictions (concerning him).” Wherefore, (Simon said,) that towards these (prophets)
those felt no concern up to the present, who believe on Simon and Helen, and that they do
whatsoever they please, as persons free; for they allege that they are saved by grace. For that
there is no reason for punishment, even though one shall act wickedly; for such a one is not
wicked by nature, but by enactment. “For the angels who created the world made,” he says,
“whatever enactments they pleased,” thinking by such (legislative) words to enslave those
who listened to them. But, again, they speak of a dissolution645 of the world, for the redemption
of his own particular adherents.</p>

And (they profess to) transmit both love-spells and charms, and the demons said to be

ignorant of the mysteries. This Simon, deceiving many646 in Samaria by his sorceries, was
reproved by the Apostles, and was laid under a curse, as it has been written in the Acts. But
he afterwards abjured the faith, and attempted these (aforesaid practices). And journeying
as far as Rome,647 he fell in with the Apostles; and to him, deceiving many by his sorceries,
Peter offered repeated opposition. This man, ultimately repairing to…(and) sitting under

conviction was imminent, in case he delayed longer, he stated that, if he were buried alive,

<note type="footnote">647 This rendering follows the text of Schneidewin and Cruice. The Clementine Recognitions (Ante-Nicene

him thither. Miller’s text is different and as emended by him, Hippolytus’ account would harmonize with that
given in the Acts. Miller’s text may be thus translated: “And having been laid under a curse, as has been written
in the Acts, he subsequently disapproved of his practices, and made an attempt to journey as far as Rome, but
he fell in with the apostles,” etc. The text of Cruice and Schneidewin seems less forced: while the statement itself—
a new witness to this controverted point in ecclesiastical history concerning St. Peter—corroborates Hippolytus’
authorship of The Refutation.</note>
<note type="footnote">648 Justin Martyr mentions, as an instance of the estimation in which Simon Magus was held among his followers,
that a statue was erected to him at Rome. Bunsen considers that the rejection of this fable of Justin
Martyr’s, points to the author of The Refutation being a Roman, who would therefore, as he shows himself in
the case of the statue, be better informed than the Eastern writer of any event occurring in the capital of the
West. [Bunsen’s magisterial decision (p. 53) is very amusingly characteristic.] Hippolytus’ silence is a presumption
against the existence of such a statue, though it is very possible he might omit to mention it, supposing it to be
at Rome. At all events, the very precise statement of Justin Martyr ought not to be rejected on slight or conjectural
grounds. [See vol. i., this series, pp. 171 ,172, 182, 187, and 193. But our author relies on Irenæus, same

whereas he remained (in that grave) until this day, for he was not the Christ. This constitutes
the legendary system advanced by Simon, and from this Valentinus derived a starting-point
(for his own doctrine. This doctrine, in point of fact, was the same with the Simonian, though
Valentinus) denominated it under different titles: for “Nous,” and “Aletheia,” and “Logos,”

<head>Chapter XVI.—Heresy of Valentinus; Derived from Plato and Pythagoras.</head>
<p>The heresy of Valentinus649 is certainly, then, connected with the Pythagorean and
Platonic theory. For Plato, in the Timæus, altogether derives his impressions from Pythagoras,
and therefore Timæus himself is his Pythagorean stranger. Wherefore, it appears expedient
that we should commence by reminding (the reader) of a few points of the Pythagorean and
Platonic theory, and that (then we should proceed) to declare the opinions of Valentinus.650
For even although in the books previously finished by us with so much pains, are contained
the opinions advanced by both Pythagoras and Plato, yet at all events I shall not be acting
unreasonably, in now also calling to the recollection of the reader, by means of an epitome,
the principal heads of the favourite tenets of these (speculators). And this (recapitulation)
will facilitate our knowledge of the doctrines of Valentinus, by means of a nearer comparison,
and by similarity of composition (of the two systems). For (Pythagoras and Plato) derived
these tenets originally from the Egyptians, and introduced their novel opinions among the
Greeks. But (Valentinus took his opinions) from these, because, although he has suppressed
the truth regarding his obligations to (the Greek philosophers), and in this way has endeavoured
to construct a doctrine, (as it were,) peculiarly his own, yet, in point of fact, he has
altered the doctrines of those (thinkers) in names only, and numbers, and has adopted a
peculiar terminology (of his own). Valentinus has formed his definitions by measures, in
order that he may establish an Hellenic heresy, diversified no doubt, but unstable, and not
connected with Christ.</p>
<note type="footnote">649 Valentinus came from Alexandria to Rome during the pontificate of Hyginus, and established a school
there. His desire seems to have been to remain in communion with Rome, which he did for many years, as
Tertullian informs us. Epiphanius, however, tells that Valentinus, towards the end of his life, when living in
Cyprus, separated entirely from the Church. Irenæus, book i.; Tertullian on Valentinus, and chap. xxx. of his

Gnostics, and not named by Hippolytus, probably as being so well known at the time. The Gospel of Truth,
mentioned by Irenæus as used among the Valentinians, is not, however, considered to be from the pen of
Valentinus. In the extracts given by Hippolytus from Valentinus, it is important (as in the case of Basilides: see
translator’s introduction) to find that he quotes St. John’s Gospel, and St. Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians. The
latter had been pronounced by the Tübingen school as belonging to the period of the Montanistic disputes in
the middle of the second century, that is, somewhere about 25–30 years after Valentinus.</note>

<p>The origin, then, from which Plato derived his theory in the Timæus, is (the) wisdom
of the Egyptians.651 For from this source, by some ancient and prophetical tradition, Solon652
taught his entire system concerning the generation and destruction of the world, as Plato
says, to the Greeks, who were (in knowledge) young children, and were acquainted with no
theological doctrine of greater antiquity. In order, therefore, that we may trace accurately
the arguments by which Valentinus established his tenets, I shall now explain what are the
principles of the philosophy of Pythagoras of Samos,—a philosophy (coupled) with that Silence

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Pythagoras’ System of Numbers.</head>
<p>Pythagoras, then, declared the originating principle of the universe to be the unbegotten
monad, and the generated duad, and the rest of the numbers. And he says that the monad
is the father of the duad, and the duad the mother of all things that are being begotten—the
begotten one (being mother) of the things that are begotten. And Zaratas, the pupil of Pythagoras,
was in the habit of denominating unity a father, and duality a mother. For the
duad has been generated from the monad, according to Pythagoras; and the monad is male
and primary, but the duad female (and secondary). And from the duad, again, as Pythagoras
states, (are generated) the triad and the succeeding numbers up to ten. For Pythagoras is
aware that this is the only perfect number—I mean the decade—for that eleven and twelve
are an addition and repetition of the decade; not, however, that what is added653 constitutes
the generation of another number. And all solid bodies he generates from incorporeal (essences).
For he asserts that an element and principle of both corporeal and incorporeal entities
is the point which is indivisible. And from a point, he says, is generated a line, and
from a line a surface; and a surface flowing out into a height becomes, he says, a solid body.
Whence also the Pythagoreans have a certain object of adjuration, viz., the concord of the
four elements. And they swear in these words:—
<lg>
<l>“By him who to our head quaternion gives,</l>
<l>A font that has the roots of everlasting nature.”654</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Now the quaternion is the originating principle of natural and solid bodies, as the
monad of intelligible ones. And that likewise the quaternion generates,655 he says, the perfect
number, as in the case of intelligibles (the monad) does the decade, they teach thus. If any,
beginning to number, says one, and adds two, then in like manner three, these (together)
will be six, and to these (add) moreover four, the entire (sum), in like manner, will be ten.
For one, two, three, four, become ten, the perfect number. Thus, he says, the quaternion in
every respect imitated the intelligible monad, which was able to generate a perfect number.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Pythagoras’ Duality of Substances; His “Categories.”</head>
<p>There are, then, according to Pythagoras, two worlds: one intelligible, which has the
monad for an originating principle; and the other sensible. But of this (latter) is the quaternion
having the iota, the one tittle,656 a perfect number. And there likewise is, according
to the Pythagoreans, the i, the one tittle, which is chief and most dominant, and enables us
to apprehend the substance of those intelligible entities which are capable of being understood
through the medium of intellect and of sense. (And in this substance inhere) the nine incorporeal
accidents which cannot exist without substance, viz., “quality,” and “quantity,” and
“relation,” and “where,” and “when,” and “position,” and “possession,” and “action,” and
“passion.” These, then, are the nine accidents (inhering in) substance, and when reckoned
with these (substances), contains the perfect number, the i. Wherefore, the universe being
divided, as we said, into the intelligible and sensible world, we have also reason from the
intelligible (world), in order that by reason we may behold the substance of things that are
cognised by intellect, and are incorporeal and divine. But we have, he says, five
senses—smelling, seeing, hearing, taste, and touch. Now, by these we arrive at a knowledge
of things that are discerned by sense; and so, he says, the sensible is divided from the intelligible
world. And that we have for each of these an instrument for attaining knowledge, we
perceive from the following consideration. Nothing, he says, of intelligibles can be known
to us from sense. For he says neither eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor any whatsoever of the
other senses known that (which is cognised by mind). Neither, again, by reason is it possible
to arrive at a knowledge of any of the things discernible by sense. But one must see that a
thing is white, and taste that it is sweet, and know by hearing that it is musical or out of
tune. And whether any odour is fragrant or disagreeable, is the function of smell, not of
reason. It is the same with objects of touch; for anything rough, or soft, or warm, or cold, it
is not possible to know by hearing, but (far from it), for touch is the judge of such (sensations).
Things being thus constituted, the arrangement of things that have been made and
are being made is observed to happen in conformity with numerical (combinations). For
in the same manner as, commencing from monad, by an addition of monads or triads, and
a collection of the succeeding numbers, we make some one very large complex whole of
number; (and) then, again, from an amassed number thus formed by addition, we accomplish,
by means of a certain subtraction and re-calculation, a solution of the totality of the aggregate
numbers; so likewise he asserts that the world, bound by a certain arithmetical and musical
chain, was, by its tension and relaxation, and by addition and subtraction, always and for
ever preserved incorrupt.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Pythagoras’ Cosmogony; Similar to that of Empedocles.</head>
<p>The Pythagoreans therefore declare their opinion concerning the continuance of the
world in some such manner as this:—
<lg>
<l>“For heretofore it was and will be; never, I ween,</l>
<l>Of both of these will void the age eternal be.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>“Of these;” but what are they? Discord and Love. Now, in their system, Love forms the
world incorruptible (and) eternal, as they suppose. For substance and the world are one.
Discord, however, separates and puts asunder, and evinces numerous attempts by subdividing
to form the world. It is just as if one severs into small parts, and divides arithmetically, the
myriad into thousands, and hundreds, and tens; and drachmæ into oboli and small farthings.
In this manner, he says, Discord severs the substance of the world into animals, plants,
metals and things similar to these. And the fabricator of the generation of all things produced
is, according to them, Discord; whereas Love, on the other hand, manages and provides for
the universe in such a manner that it enjoys permanence. And conducting together657 into
unity the divided and scattered parts of the universe, and leading them forth from their
(separate) mode of existence, (Love) unites and adds to the universe, in order that it may
enjoy permanence; and it thus constitutes one system. They will not therefore cease,—neither
Discord dividing the world, nor Love attaching to the world the divided parts. Of some such
description as this, so it appears, is the distribution of the world according to Pythagoras.
But Pythagoras says that the stars are fragments from the sun, and that the souls658 of animals
are conveyed from the stars; and that these are mortal when they are in the body, just as if
buried, as it were, in a tomb: whereas that they rise (out of this world) and become immortal,
when we are separated from our bodies. Whence Plato, being asked by some one, “What
is philosophy?” replied, “It is a separation of soul from body.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Other Opinions of Pythagoras.</head>
<p>Pythagoras, then, became a student of these doctrines likewise, in which he speaks both
by enigmas and some such expressions as these: “When you depart from your own (tabernacle),
return not;659 if, however, (you act) not (thus), the Furies, auxiliaries to justice, will
overtake you,”—denominating the body one’s own (tabernacle), and its passions the Furies.
When, therefore, he says, you depart, that is, when you go forth from the body, do not
earnestly crave for this; but if you are eagerly desirous (for departure), the passions will once
more confine you within the body. For these suppose that there is a transition of souls from
one body to another, as also Empedocles, adopting the principles of Pythagoras, affirms.
For, says he, souls that are lovers of pleasure, as Plato states,660 if, when they are in the
condition of suffering incidental to man, they do not evolve theories of philosophy, must
pass through all animals and plants (back) again into a human body. And when (the soul)
may form a system of speculation thrice in the same body, (he maintains) that it ascends
up to the nature of some kindred star. If, however, (the soul) does not philosophize, (it must
pass) through the same (succession of changes once more). He affirms, then, that the soul
sometimes may become even mortal, if it is overcome by the Furies, that is, the passions (of
the body); and immortal, if it succeeds in escaping the Furies, which are the passions.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—The “Sayings” Of Pythagoras.</head>
<p>But since also we have chosen to mention the sayings darkly expressed by Pythagoras
to his disciples by means of symbols, it seems likewise expedient to remind (the reader) of
the rest (of his doctrines. And we touch on this subject) on account also of the heresiarchs,
who attempt by some method of this description to converse by means of symbols; and
these are not their own, but they have, (in propounding them,) taken advantage of expressions
employed by the Pythagoreans.661 Pythagoras then instructs his disciples, addressing them
as follows: “Bind up the sack that carries the bedding.” (Now,) inasmuch as they who intend
going upon a journey tie their clothes into a wallet, to be ready for the road; so, (in like
manner,) he wishes his disciples to be prepared, since every moment death is likely to come
upon them by surprise.662 (In this way Pythagoras sought to effect) that (his followers)
should labour under no deficiency in the qualifications required in his pupils.663 Wherefore
of necessity he was in the habit, with the dawn of day, of instructing the Pythagoreans to
encourage one another to bind up the sack that carries the bedding, that is, to be ready for
death. “Do not stir fire with a sword;”664 (meaning,) do not, by addressing him, quarrel
with an enraged man; for a person in a passion is like fire, whereas the sword is the uttered
expression. “Do not trample on a besom;”665 (meaning,) despise not a small matter. “Plant
not a palm tree in a house;” (meaning,) foment not discord in a family, for the palm tree is
a symbol of battle and slaughter.666 “Eat not from a stool;” (meaning,) do not undertake an
ignoble art, in order that you may not be a slave to the body, which is corruptible, but make
<note type="footnote">661 These sayings (Symbola Pythagorica) have been collected by, amongst others, Thomas Stanley, and more
recently by Gaspar Orellius. The meaning and the form of the proverbs given by Hippolytus do not always
correspond with, e.g., Jamblichus (the biographer of Pythagoras), Porphyry, and Plutarch. The curious reader
can see the Proverbs, in all their variety of readings and explanations, in the edition of L. Gyraldus.</note>
<note type="footnote">662 This has been explained by Erasmus as a precept enjoining habits of tidiness and modesty.</note>
<note type="footnote">663 Miller’s text here yields a different but not very intelligible meaning.</note>
<note type="footnote">664 Horace quotes this proverb (2 Serm., iii. 274) with a somewhat different meaning. Porphyry considers it
a precept against irreverent language towards the Deity, the fire being a symbol—for instance, the vestal fire—of
the everlasting nature of God. Σκάλευε in Hippolytus is also read, e.g., by Basil, ζαίνοντες, that is, cleaving. This
alludes to some ancient game in which fire was struck at and severed.</note>
<note type="footnote">665 Σάρον. This word also signifies “sweepings” or “refuse.” Some say it means a Chaldean or Babylonian
measure. The meaning would then be: Neglect not giving good measure, i.e., practise fair dealing. This agrees
with another form of the proverb, reading ζυγόν for σάρον—that is, overlook not the balance or scales.</note>
<note type="footnote">666 Another meaning assigned to this proverb is, “Labour to no purpose.” The palm, it is alleged, when it
grows of itself, produces fruit, but sterility ensues upon transplantation. The proverb is also said to mean: Avoid
what may seem agreeable, but really is injurious. This alludes to the quality of the wine (see Xenophon’s Anab.,
ii.), which, pleasant in appearance, produced severe headache in those partaking of it.</note>

a livelihood from literature. For it lies within your reach both to nourish the body, and make
the soul better.667 “Don’t take a bite out of an uncut loaf;” (meaning,) diminish not thy
possessions, but live on the profit (of them), and guard thy substance as an entire loaf.668
“Feed not on beans; (meaning,) accept not the government of a city, for with beans they at
that time were accustomed to ballot for their magistrates.669</p>
<note type="footnote">667 “Eat not from a stool.” This proverb is also differently read and interpreted. Another form is, “Eat not
from a chariot,” of which the import is variously given, as, Do not tamper with your health, because food swallowed
in haste, as it must be when one is driving a team of horses, cannot be salutary or nutritive; or, Do not be
careless, because one should attend to the business in hand; if that be guiding a chariot, one should not at the
same time try to eat his meals.</note>
<note type="footnote">668 The word “entire” Plutarch adds to this proverb. Its ancient form would seem to inculcate patience and
courtesy, as if one should not, when at meals, snap at food before others. As read in Plutarch, it has been also
interpreted as a precept to avoid creating dissension, the unbroken bread being a symbol of unity. It has likewise
been explained as an injunction against greediness. The loaf was marked by two intersecting lines into four
parts, and one was not to devour all of these. (See Horace, 1 Epist., xvii. 49.)</note>
<note type="footnote">669 This is the generally received import of the proverb. Ancient writers, however, put forward other
meanings, connected chiefly with certain effects of beans, e.g., disturbing the mind, and producing melancholy,
which Pythagoras is said to have noticed. Horace had no such idea concerning beans (see 2 Serm, vi. 63), but
evidently alludes to a belief of the magi that disembodied spirits resided in beans. (See Lucian, Micyll.; Plutarch,
Περὶ Παίδ. ᾽Αγωγ. 17; Aulus Gellius, iv. 11; and Guigniaut’s Cruiser’s Symbolik, i. 160.) [See p. 12 supra, and

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Pythagoras’ Astronomic System.</head>
<p>These, then, and such like assertions, the Pythagoreans put forward; and the heretics,
imitating these, are supposed by some to utter important truths. The Pythagorean system,
however, lays down that the Creator of all alleged existences is the Great Geometrician and
Calculator—a sun; and that this one has been fixed in the whole world, just as in the bodies
a soul, according to the statement of Plato. For the sun (being of the nature of) fire,670 resembles
the soul, but the earth (resembles the) body. And, separated from fire, there would
be nothing visible, nor would there be any object of touch without something solid; but not
any solid body exists without earth. Whence the Deity, locating air in the midst, fashioned
the body of the universe out of fire and earth. And the Sun, he says, calculates and geometrically
measures the world in some such manner as the following: The world is a unity cognizable
by sense; and concerning this (world) we now make these assertions. But one who
is an adept in the science of numbers, and a geometrician, has divided it into twelve parts.
And the names of these parts are as follow: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra,
Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces. Again, he divides each of the twelve parts
into thirty parts, and these are days of the month. Again, he divides each part of the thirty
parts into sixty small divisions, and (each) of these small (divisions) he subdivides into
minute portions, and (these again) into portions still more minute. And always doing this,
and not intermitting, but collecting from these divided portions (an aggregate), and constituting
it a year; and again resolving and dividing the compound, (the sun) completely finishes
the great and everlasting world.671</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Valentinus Convicted of Plagiarisms from the Platonic and Pythagoric
Philosophy; The Valentinian Theory of Emanation by Duads.</head>
<p>Of some such nature, as I who have accurately examined their systems (have attempted)
to state compendiously, is the opinion of Pythagoras and Plato. And from this (system), not
from the Gospels, Valentinus, as we have proved, has collected the (materials of) heresy—I
mean his own (heresy)—and may (therefore) justly be reckoned a Pythagorean and Platonist,
not a Christian. Valentinus, therefore, and Heracleon, and Ptolemæus, and the entire school
of these (heretics), as disciples of Pythagoras and Plato, (and) following these guides, have
laid down as a fundamental principle of their doctrine the arithmetical system. For, likewise,
according to these (Valentinians), the originating cause of the universe is a Monad, unbegotten,
imperishable, incomprehensible, inconceivable, productive, and a cause of the generation
of all existent things. And the aforesaid Monad is styled by them Father. There is,
however, discoverable among them some considerable diversity of opinion. For some of
them, in order that the Pythagorean doctrine of Valentinus may be altogether free from
admixture (with other tenets), suppose that the Father is unfeminine, and unwedded, and
solitary. But others, imagining it to be impossible that from a male only there could proceed
a generation at all of any of those things that have been made to exist, necessarily reckon
along with the Father of the universe, in order that he may be a father, Sige as a spouse. But
as to Sige, whether at any time she is united in marriage (to the Father) or not, this is a point
which we leave them to wrangle about among themselves. We at present, keeping to the
Pythagorean principle, which is one, and unwedded, unfeminine, (and) deficient in nothing,
shall proceed to give an account of their doctrines, as they themselves inculcate them. There
is, says (Valentinus), not anything at all begotten, but the Father is alone unbegotten, not
subject to the condition of place, not (subject to the condition of) time, having no counsellor,
(and) not being any other substance that could be realized according to the ordinary methods
of perception. (The Father,) however, was solitary, subsisting, as they say, in a state of
quietude, and Himself reposing in isolation within Himself. When, however, He became
productive,672 it seemed to Him expedient at one time to generate and lead forth the most
beautiful and perfect (of those germs of existence) which He possessed within Himself, for
(the Father) was not fond of solitariness. For, says he, He was all love, but love is not love
except there may be some object of affection. The Father Himself, then, as He was solitary,
<note type="footnote">672 Valentinus’ system, if purged of the glosses put upon it by his disciples, appears to have been constructed
out of a grand conception of Deity, and evidences much power of abstraction. Between the essence of God,
dwelling in the midst of isolation prior to an exercise of the creative energy, and the material worlds, Valentinus
interposes an ideal world. Through the latter, the soul—of a kindred nature—is enabled to mount up to God.
This is the import of the terms Bythus (depth) and Sige (silence, i.e., solitariness) afterwards used.</note>

projected and produced Nous and Aletheia, that is, a duad which became mistress,673 and
origin, and mother of all the Æons computed by them (as existing) within the Pleroma.
Nous and Aletheia being projected from the Father,674 one capable of continuing generation,
deriving existence from a productive being, (Nous) himself likewise, in imitation of the
Father, projected Logos and Zoe; and Logos and Zoe project Anthropos and Ecclesia. But
Nous and Aletheia, when they beheld that their own offspring had been born productive,
returned thanks to the Father of the universe, and offer unto Him a perfect number, viz.,
ten Æons. For, he says, Nous and Aletheia could not offer unto the Father a more perfect
(one) than this number. For the Father, who is perfect, ought to be celebrated by a perfect
number, and ten is a perfect number, because this is first of those (numbers) that are formed
by plurality, (and therefore) perfect.675 The Father, however, being more perfect, because
being alone unbegotten, by means of the one primary conjugal union of Nous and Aletheia,
found means of projecting all the roots of existent things.</p>

three developments in this transition. Absolute being (Bythus and Sige) is the same as the eternal thought and
consciousness of God’s own essence. Here we have the primary emanation, viz., Nous, i.e., Mind (called also
Monogenes, only-begotten), and Aletheia, i.e., Truth. Next comes the ideal manifestation through the Logos,
i.e., Word (obviously borrowed from the prologue to St. John’s Gospel), and Zoe, i.e., Life (taken from the same
source). We have then the passage from the ideal to the actual in Anthropos, i.e., Man, and Ecclesia, i.e., Church.
These last are the phenomenal manifestations of the divine mind.</note>

<p>Logos himself also, and Zoe, then saw that Nous and Aletheia had celebrated the Father
of the universe by a perfect number; and Logos himself likewise with Zoe wished to magnify
their own father and mother, Nous and Aletheia. Since, however, Nous and Aletheia were
begotten, and did not possess paternal (and) perfect uncreatedness, Logos and Zoe do not
glorify Nous their father with a perfect number, but far from it, with an imperfect one.676
For Logos and Zoe offer twelve Æons unto Nous and Aletheia. For, according to Valentinus,
these—namely, Nous and Aletheia, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia—have been the
primary roots of the Æons. But there are ten Æons proceeding from Nous and Aletheia,
and twelve from Logos and Zoe—twenty and eight in all.677 And to these (ten) they give
these following denominations:678 Bythus and Mixis, Ageratus and Henosis, Autophyes
and Hedone, Acinetus and Syncrasis, Monogenes and Macaria.679 These are ten Æons
whom some say (have been projected) by Nous and Aletheia, but some by Logos and Zoe.
Others, however, affirm that the twelve (Æons have been projected) by Anthropos and Ecclesia,
while others by Logos and Zoe. And upon these they bestow these following names:680
Paracletus and Pistis, Patricus and Elpis, Metricus and Agape, Æinous and Synesis, Ecclesiasticus
and Macariotes, Theletus and Sophia. But of the twelve, the twelfth and youngest of
all the twenty-eight Æons, being a female, and called Sophia, observed the multitude and
power of the begetting Æons, and hurried back into the depth of the Father. And she perceived
that all the rest of the Æons, as being begotten, generate by conjugal intercourse. The
Father, on the other hand, alone, without copulation, has produced (an offspring). She

however,) was ignorant that the Unbegotten One, being an originating principle of the
universe, as well as root and depth and abyss, alone possesses the power of self-generation.
But Sophia, being begotten, and born after many more (Æons), is not able to acquire possession
of the power inherent in the Unbegotten One. For in the Unbegotten One, he says,
all things exist simultaneously, but in the begotten (Æons) the female is projective of substance,
and the male is formative of the substance which is projected by the female. Sophia,
therefore, prepared to project that only which she was capable (of projecting), viz., a formless
and undigested substance.683 And this, he says, is what Moses asserts: “The earth was invisible,
and unfashioned.” This (substance) is, he says, the good (and) the heavenly Jerusalem,
into which God has promised to conduct the children of Israel, saying, “I will bring you into
a land flowing with milk and honey.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Valentinus’ Explanation of the Existence of Christ and the Spirit.</head>
<p>Ignorance, therefore, having arisen within the Pleroma in consequence of Sophia, and
shapelessness in consequence of the offspring of Sophia, confusion arose in the Pleroma.
(For all) the Æons that were begotten (became overwhelmed with apprehension, imagining)
that in like manner formless and incomplete progenies of the Æons should be generated;
and that some destruction, at no distant period, should at length seize upon the Æons. All
the Æons, then, betook themselves to supplication of the Father, that he would tranquillize
the sorrowing Sophia; for she continued weeping and bewailing on account of the abortion
produced by her,—for so they term it. The Father, then, compassionating the tears of Sophia,
and accepting the supplication of the Æons, orders a further projection. For he did not,
(Valentinus) says, himself project, but Nous and Aletheia (projected) Christ and the Holy
Spirit for the restoration of Form, and the destruction of the abortion, and (for) the consolation
and cessation of the groans of Sophia. And thirty Æons came into existence along
with Christ and the Holy Spirit. Some of these (Valentinians) wish that this should be a triacontad
of Æons, whereas others desire that Sige should exist along with the Father, and
that the Æons should be reckoned along with them.</p>
<p>Christ, therefore, being additionally projected, and the Holy Spirit, by Nous and Aletheia,
immediately this abortion of Sophia, (which was) shapeless, (and) born of herself only, and
generated without conjugal intercourse, separates from the entire of the Æons, lest the
perfect Æons, beholding this (abortion), should be disturbed by reason of its shapelessness.
In order, then, that the shapelessness of the abortion might not at all manifest itself to the
perfect Æons, the Father also again projects additionally one Æon, viz., Staurus. And he
being begotten great, as from a mighty and perfect father, and being projected for the
guardianship and defence of the Æons, becomes a limit of the Pleroma, having within itself
all the thirty Æons together, for these are they that had been projected. Now this (Æon) is
styled Horos, because he separates from the Pleroma the Hysterema that is outside. And
(he is called) Metocheus, because he shares also in the Hysterema. And (he is denominated)
Staurus, because he is fixed inflexibly and inexorably, so that nothing of the Hysterema can
come near the Æons who are within the Pleroma. Outside, then, Horos, (or) Metocheus,684
(or) Staurus, is the Ogdoad, as it is called, according to them, and is that Sophia which is
outside the Pleroma, which (Sophia) Christ, who was additionally projected by Nous and
Aletheia, formed and made a perfect Æon so that in no respect she should be inferior in
power to any of the Æons within the Pleroma.685 Since, however, Sophia was formed outside,
and it was not possible and equitable that Christ and the Holy Spirit, who were projected

from Nous and Aletheia, should remain outside the Pleroma, Christ hurried away, and the
Holy Spirit, from her who had had shape imparted to her, unto Nous and Aletheia within
the Limit, in order that with the rest of the Æons they might glorify the Father.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Valentinus’ Explanation of the Existence of Jesus; Power of Jesus
Over Humanity.</head>
<p>After, then, there ensued some one (treaty of) peace and harmony between all the Æons
within the Pleroma, it appeared expedient to them not only by a conjugal union to have
magnified the Son, but also that by an offering of ripe fruits they should glorify the Father.
Then all the thirty Æons consented to project one Æon, joint fruit of the Pleroma, that he
might be (an earnest) of their union,686 and unanimity, and peace. And he alone was projected
by all the Æons in honour of the Father. This (one) is styled among them “Joint Fruit
of the Pleroma.” These (matters), then, took place within the Pleroma in this way. And the
“Joint Fruit of the Pleroma” was projected, (that is,) Jesus,—for this is his name,—the great
High Priest. Sophia, however, who was outside the Pleroma in search of Christ, who had
given her form, and of the Holy Spirit, became involved in great terror that she would perish,
if he should separate from her, who had given her form and consistency. And she was seized
with grief, and fell into a state of considerable perplexity, (while) reflecting who was he who
had given her form, what the Holy Spirit was, whither he had departed, who it was that had
hindered them from being present, who it was that had been envious of that glorious and
blessed spectacle. While involved in sufferings such as these, she turns herself to prayer and
supplication of him who had deserted her. During the utterance of her entreaties, Christ,
who is within the Pleroma, had mercy upon (her), and all the rest of the Æons (were similarly
affected); and they send forth beyond the Pleroma “the Joint Fruit of the Pleroma” as a
spouse for Sophia, who was outside, and as a rectifier of those sufferings which she underwent
in searching after Christ.</p>
<p>“The Fruit,” then, arriving outside the Pleroma, and discovering (Sophia) in the midst
of those four primary passions, both fear and sorrow, and perplexity and entreaty, he rectified
her affections. While, however, correcting them, he observed that it would not be proper
to destroy these, inasmuch as they are (in their nature) eternal, and peculiar to Sophia; and
yet that neither was it seemly that Sophia should exist in the midst of such passions, in fear
and sorrow, supplication (and) perplexity. He therefore, as an Æon so great, and (as) offspring
of the entire Pleroma, caused the passions to depart from her, and he made these substantially-
existent essences.687 He altered fear into animal desire,688 and (made) grief material,
and (rendered) perplexity (the passion) of demons. But conversion,689 and entreaty, and
supplication, he constituted as a path to repentance and power over the animal essence,

which is denominated right.690 The Creator691 (acted) from fear; (and) that is what, he says,
Scripture affirms: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”692 For this is the be-
ginning of the affections of Sophia, for she was seized with fear, next with grief, then with
perplexity, and so she sought refuge in entreaty and supplication. And the animal essence
is, he says, of a fiery nature, and is also termed by them the super-celestial Topos, and
Hebdomad,693 and “Ancient of Days.”694 And whatever other such statements they advance
respecting this (Æon), these they allege to hold good of the animalish (one), whom they
assert to be creator of the world. Now he is of the appearance of fire. Moses also, he says,
expresses himself thus: “The Lord thy God is a burning and consuming fire.”695 For he,
likewise, wishes (to think) that it has been so written. There is, however, he says, a twofold
power of the fire; for fire is all-consuming, (and) cannot be quenched. According, therefore,
to this division, there exists, subject to death, a certain soul which is a sort of mediator, for
it is a Hebdomad and Cessation.696 For underneath the Ogdoad, where Sophia is, but above
Matter, which is the Creator, a day has been formed,697 and the “Joint Fruit of the Pleroma.”
If the soul has been fashioned in the image of those above, that is, the Ogdoad, it became
immortal and repaired to the Ogdoad, which is, he says, heavenly Jerusalem. If, however,
it has been fashioned in the image of Matter, that is, the corporeal passions, the soul is of a
perishable nature, and is (accordingly) destroyed.</p>

<p>As, therefore, the primary and greatest power698 of the animal essence came into existence,
an image (of the only begotten Son); so also the devil, who is the ruler of this world,
constitutes the power of the material essence, as Beelzebub is of the essence of demons which
emanates from anxiety. (In consequence of this,) Sophia from above exerted her energy
from the Ogdoad to the Hebdomad. For the Demiurge, they say, knows nothing at all, but
is, according to them, devoid of understanding, and silly, and is not conscious of what he
is doing or working at. But in him, while thus in a state of ignorance that even he is producing,
Sophia wrought all sorts of energy, and infused vigour (into him). And (although Sophia)
was really the operating cause, he himself imagines that he evolves the creation of the world
out of himself: whence he commenced, saying, “I am God, and beside me there is no other.”

<head>Chapter XXIX.—The Other Valentinian Emanations in Conformity with the Pythagorean
System of Numbers.</head>
<p>The quaternion, then, advocated by Valentinus, is “a source of the everlasting nature
having roots;”700 and Sophia (is the power) from whom the animal and material creation
has derived its present condition. But Sophia is called “Spirit,” and the Demiurge “Soul,”
and the Devil “the ruler of this world,” and Beelzebub “the (ruler) of demons.” These are
the statements which they put forward. But further, in addition to these, rendering, as I have
previously mentioned, their entire system of doctrine (akin to the) arithmetical (art), (they
determine) that the thirty Æons within the Pleroma have again, in addition to these, projected
other Æons, according to the (numerical) proportion (adopted by the Pythagoreans), in
order that the Pleroma might be formed into an aggregate, according to a perfect number.
For how the Pythagoreans divided (the celestial sphere) into twelve and thirty and sixty
parts, and how they have minute parts of diminutive portions, has been made evident.</p>
<p>In this manner these (followers of Valentinus) subdivide the parts within the Pleroma.
Now likewise the parts in the Ogdoad have been subdivided, and there has been projected
Sophia, which is, according to them, mother of all living creatures, and the “Joint Fruit of
the Pleroma,” (who is) the Logos,701 (and other Æons,) who are celestial angels that have
their citizenship in Jerusalem which is above, which is in heaven. For this Jerusalem is
Sophia, she (that is) outside (the Pleroma), and her spouse is the “Joint Fruit of the Pleroma.”
And the Demiurge projected souls; for this (Sophia) is the essence of souls. This (Demiurge),
according to them, is Abraham, and these (souls) the children of Abraham. From the material
and devilish essence the Demiurge fashioned bodies for the souls. This is what has been
declared: “And God formed man, taking clay from the earth, and breathed upon his face
the breath of life, and man was made into a living soul.”702 This, according to them, is the
inner man, the natural (man), residing in the material body: Now a material (man) is per-
ishable, incomplete, (and) formed out of the devilish essence. And this is the material man,
as it were, according to them an inn,703 or domicile, at one time of soul only, at another
time of soul and demons, at another time of soul and Logoi.704 And these are the Logoi that
have been dispersed from above, from the “Joint Fruit of the Pleroma” and (from) Sophia,
into this world. And they dwell in an earthly body, with a soul, when demons do not take

account I bend my knees to the God and Father and Lord of our Lord Jesus Christ, that God
would grant you to have Christ dwelling in the inner man,”705—that is, the natural (man),
not the corporeal (one),—“that you may be able to understand what is the depth,” which is
the Father of the universe, “and what is the breadth,” which is Staurus, the limit of the
Pleroma, “or what is the length,” that is, the Pleroma of the Æons. Wherefore, he says, “the
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto
him;”706 but folly, he says, is the power of the Demiurge, for he was foolish and devoid of
understanding, and imagined himself to be fabricating the world. He was, however, ignorant
that Sophia, the Mother, the Ogdoad, was really the cause of all the operations performed
by him who had no consciousness in reference to the creation of the world.</p>

<p>All the prophets, therefore, and the law, spoke by means of the Demiurge,—a silly god,707
he says, (and themselves) fools, who knew nothing. On account of this, he says, the Saviour
observes: “All that came before me are thieves and robbers.”708 And the apostle (uses these
words): “The mystery which was not made known to former generations.”709 For none of
the prophets, he says, said anything concerning the things of which we speak; for (a prophet)
could not but be ignorant of all (these) things, inasmuch as they certainly had been uttered
by the Demiurge only. When, therefore, the creation received completion, and when after
(this) there ought to have been the revelation of the sons of God—that is, of the Demiurge,
which up to this had been concealed, and in which obscurity the natural man was hid, and
had a veil upon the heart;—when (it was time), then, that the veil should be taken away, and
that these mysteries should be seen, Jesus was born of Mary the virgin, according to the
declaration (in Scripture), “The Holy Ghost will come upon thee”—Sophia is the Spirit—“and
the power of the Highest will overshadow thee”—the Highest is the Demiurge,—“wherefore
that which shall be born of thee shall be called holy.”710 For he has been generated not from
the highest alone, as those created in (the likeness of) Adam have been created from the
highest alone—that is, (from) Sophia and the Demiurge. Jesus, however, the new man, (has
been generated) from the Holy Spirit—that is, Sophia and the Demiurge—in order that the
Demiurge may complete the conformation and constitution of his body, and that the Holy
Spirit may supply his essence, and that a celestial Logos may proceed from the Ogdoad being
born of Mary.</p>
<p>Concerning this (Logos) they have a great question amongst them—an occasion both
of divisions and dissension. And hence the doctrine of these has become divided: and one
doctrine, according to them, is termed Oriental, and the other Italian. They from Italy, of
whom is Heracleon and Ptolemæus, say that the body of Jesus was (an) animal (one). And
on account of this, (they maintain) that at his baptism the Holy Spirit as a dove came
down—that is, the Logos of the mother above, (I mean Sophia)—and became (a voice) to
the animal (man), and raised him from the dead. This, he says, is what has been declared:
“He who raised Christ from the dead will also quicken your mortal and natural bodies.”711

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Further Doctrines of Valentinus Respecting the Æons; Reasons for
the Incarnation.</head>
<p>Let, then, those (heretics) pursue these inquiries among themselves, (and let others do
so likewise,) if it should prove agreeable to anybody else to investigate (such points. Valen
tinus) subjoins, however, the following statement: That the trespasses appertaining to the
Æons within (the Pleroma) had been corrected; and likewise had been rectified the trespasses
appertaining to the Ogdoad, (that is,) Sophia, outside (the Pleroma); and also (the trespasses)
appertaining to the Hebdomad (had been rectified). For the Demiurge had been taught by
Sophia that He is not Himself God alone, as He imagined, and that except Himself there is
not another (Deity). But when taught by Sophia, He was made to recognise the superior
(Deity). For He was instructed715 by her, and initiated and indoctrinated into the great
mystery of the Father and of the Æons, and divulged this to none. This is, as he says, what
(God) declares to Moses: “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob; and my name I have not announced to them;”716 that is, I have not declared the
mystery, nor explained who is God, but I have preserved the mystery which I have heard
from Sophia in secrecy with myself. When, then, the trespasses of those above had been
rectified, it was necessary, according to the same consequence, that the (transgressions) here
likewise should obtain rectification. On this account Jesus the Saviour was born of Mary
that he might rectify (the trespasses committed) here; as the Christ who, having been projected
additionally from above by Nous and Aletheia, had corrected the passions of
Sophia—that is, the abortion (who was) outside (the Pleroma). And, again, the Saviour who
was born of Mary came to rectify the passions717 of the soul. There are therefore, according
to these (heretics), three Christs: (the first the) one additionally projected by Nous and
Aletheia, along with the Holy Spirit; and (the second) the “Joint Fruit of the Pleroma,”
spouse of Sophia, who was outside (the Pleroma). And she herself is likewise styled Holy
Spirit, but one inferior to the first (projection). And the third (Christ is) He who was born
of Mary for the restoration of this world of ours.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Valentinus Convicted of Plagiarisms from Plato.</head>
<p>I think that the heresy of Valentinus which is of Pythagorean (origin), has been sufficiently,
indeed more than sufficiently, delineated. It therefore seems also expedient, that
having explained his opinions, we should desist from (further) refutation (of his system).
Plato, then, in expounding mysteries concerning the universe, writes to Dionysius expressing
himself after some such manner718 as this: “I must speak to you by riddles,719 in order that
if the letter may meet with any accident in its leaves by either sea or land, he who reads
(what falls into his hands) may not understand it. For so it is. All things are about the King
of all, and on his account are all things, and he is cause of all the glorious (objects of creation).
The second is about the second, and the third about the third. But pertaining to the King
there is none of those things of which I have spoken. But after this the soul earnestly desires
to learn what sort these are, looking upon those things that are akin to itself, and not one
of these is (in itself) sufficient. This is, O son of Dionysius and Doris, the question (of yours)
which is a cause of all evil things. Nay, but rather the solicitude concerning this is innate in
the soul; and if one does not remove this, he will never really attain truth.720 But what is
astonishing in this matter, listen. For there are men who have heard these things—(men)
furnished with capacities for learning, and furnished with capacities of memory, and persons
who altogether in every way are endued with an aptitude for investigation with a view to
inference. (These are) at present aged speculators.721 And they assert that opinions which
at one time were credible are now incredible, and that things once incredible are now the
contrary. While, therefore, turning the eye of examination towards these (inquiries), exercise
caution, lest at any time you should have reason to repent in regard of those things should
they happen in a manner unbecoming to your dignity. On this account I have written
nothing concerning these (points); nor is there any treatise of Plato’s (upon them), nor ever
shall there be. The observations, however, now made are those of Socrates, conspicuous for
virtue even while he was a young man.”</p>
<p>Valentinus, falling in with these (remarks), has made a fundamental principle in his
system “the King of all,” whom Plato mentioned, and whom this heretic styles Pater, and
Bythos, and Proarche722 over the rest of the Æons. And when Plato uses the words, “what

is second about things that are second,” Valentinus supposes to be second all the Æons that
are within the limit (of the Pleroma, as well as) the limit (itself). And when Plato uses the
words, “what is third about what is third,” he has (constituted as third) the entire of the arrangement
(existing) outside the limit723 and the Pleroma. And Valentinus has elucidated
this (arrangement) very succinctly, in a psalm commencing from below, not as Plato does,
from above, expressing himself thus: “I behold724 all things suspended in air by spirit, and
I perceive all things wafted by spirit; the flesh (I see) suspended from soul, but the soul
shining out from air, and air depending from Æther, and fruits produced from Bythus, and
the foetus borne from the womb.” Thus (Valentinus) formed his opinion on such (points).
Flesh, according to these (heretics), is matter which is suspended from the soul of the
Demiurge. And soul shines out from air; that is, the Demiurge emerges from the spirit,
(which is) outside the Pleroma. But air springs forth from Æther; that is, Sophia, which is
outside (the Pleroma, is projected from the Pleroma) which is within the limit, and (from)
the entire Pleroma (generally). And from Bythus fruits are produced; (that is,) the entire
projection of the Æons is made from the Father. The opinions, then, advanced by Valentinus
have been sufficiently declared. It remains for us to explain the tenets of those who have
emanated from his school, though each adherent (of Valentinus) entertains different opinions.

And he affirms that the power which withdrew and laboured under deficiency, was
not produced from the thirty Æons, but from the fruits of these. Some other (heretic),
however—Epiphanes, a teacher among them—expresses himself thus: “The earliest originating
principle was inconceivable, ineffable, and unnameable;” and he calls this Monotes.
And (he maintains) that there co-exists with this (principle) a power which he denominates
Henotes. This Henotes and this Monotes, not by projection (from themselves), sent forth
a principle (that should preside) over all intelligibles; (and this was) both unbegotten and
invisible, and he styles it a Monad. “With this power co-exists a power of the same essence,
which very (power) I call Unity. These four powers sent forth the remainder of the projections
of the Æons.” But others, again, denominate the chief and originating Ogdoad, (which is)
fourth (and) invisible, by the following names: first, Proarche; next, Anennoetus; third,
Arrhetus; and fourth, Aoratus. And that from the first, Proarche, was projected by a first
and fifth place, Arche; and from Anennoetus, by a second and sixth place, Acataleptus; and
from Arrhetus, by a third and seventh place, Anonomastus; and from Aoratus, Agennetus,
a complement of the first Ogdoad. They wish that these powers should exist before Bythus
and Sige. Concerning, however, Bythus himself, there are many different opinions. Some
affirm him to be unwedded, neither male nor female; but others (maintain) that Sige, who
is a female, is present with him, and that this constitutes the first conjugal union.</p>
<p>But the followers of Ptolemæus727 assert that (Bythus) has two spouses, which they call
likewise dispositions, viz., Ennoia and Thelesis (conception and volition). For first the notion
was conceived of projecting anything; next followed, as they say, the will to do so. Wherefore
also these two dispositions and powers—namely, Ennoia and Thelesis—being, as it were,
mingled one with the other, there ensued a projection of Monogenes and Aletheia by means
of a conjugal union. And the consequence was, that visible types and images of those two
dispositions of the Father came forth from the invisible (Æons), viz., from Thelema, Nous,
and from Ennoia, Aletheia. And on this account the image of the subsequently generated
Thelema is (that of a) male; but (the image) of the unbegotten Ennoia is (that of a) female,
since volition is, as it were, a power of conception. For conception always cherished the idea
of a projection, yet was not of itself at least able to project itself, but cherished the idea (of

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—System of Marcus; A Mere Impostor; His Wicked Devices Upon
the Eucharistic Cup.</head>
<p>A certain other teacher among them, Marcus,728 an adept in sorcery, carrying on oper-
ations729 partly by sleight of hand and partly by demons, deceived many from time to time.
This (heretic) alleged that there resided in him the mightiest power from invisible and unnameable
places. And very often, taking the Cup, as if offering up the Eucharistic prayer,
and prolonging to a greater length than usual the word of invocation, he would cause the
appearance of a purple, and sometimes of a red mixture, so that his dupes imagined that a
certain Grace descended and communicated to the potion a blood-red potency. The knave,
however, at that time succeeded in escaping detection from many; but now, being convicted
(of the imposture), he will be forced to desist from it. For, infusing secretly into the mixture
some drug that possessed the power of imparting such a colour (as that alluded to above),
uttering for a considerable time nonsensical expressions, he was in the habit of waiting, (in
expectation) that the (drug), obtaining a supply of moisture, might be dissolved, and, being
intermingled with the potion, might impart its colour to it. The drugs, however, that possess
the quality of furnishing this effect we have previously mentioned in the book on magicians.
730 And here we have taken occasion to explain how they make dupes of many, and
thoroughly ruin them. And if it should prove agreeable to them to apply their attention with
greater accuracy to the statement made by us, they will become aware of the deceit of Marcus.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—Further Acts of Jugglery on the Part of Marcus.</head>
<p>And this (Marcus), infusing (the aforesaid) mixture into a smaller cup, was in the habit
of delivering it to a woman to offer up the Eucharistic prayer, while he himself stood by,
and held (in his hand) another empty (chalice) larger than that. And after his female dupe
had pronounced the sentence of Consecration,731 having received (the cup from her), he
proceeded to infuse (its contents) into the larger (chalice), and, pouring them frequently
from one cup to the other, was accustomed at the same time to utter the following invocation:
“Grant that the inconceivable and ineffable Grace which existed prior to the universe, may
fill thine inner man, and make to abound in thee the knowledge of this (grace), as She disseminates
the seed of the mustard-tree upon the good soil.” And simultaneously pronouncing
some such words as these, and astonishing both his female dupe and those that are present,
he was regarded as one performing a miracle; while the larger was being filled from the
smaller chalice, in such a way as that (the contents), being superabundant, flowed over. And
the contrivance of this (juggler) we have likewise explained in the aforesaid (fourth) book,
where we have proved that very many drugs, when mingled in this way with liquid substances,
are endued with the quality of yielding augmentation, more particularly when diluted in
wine. Now, when (one of these impostors) previously smears, in a clandestine manner, an
empty cup with any one of these drugs, and shows it (to the spectators) as if it contained
nothing, by infusing into it (the contents) from the other cup, and pouring them back again,
the drug, as it is of a flatulent nature, is dissolved732 by being blended with the moist substance.
And the effect of this was, that a superabundance of the mixture ensued, and was so
far augmented, that what was infused was put in motion, such being the nature of the drug.
And if one stow away (the chalice) when it has been filled, (what has been poured into it)
will after no long time return to its natural dimensions, inasmuch as the potency of the drug
becomes extinct by reason of the continuance of moisture. Wherefore he was in the habit
of hurriedly presenting the cup to those present, to drink; but they, horrified at the same
time, and eager (to taste the contents of the cup), proceeded to drink (the mixture), as if it
were something divine, and devised by the Deity.733</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—The Heretical Practices of the Marcites in Regard of Baptism.</head>
<p>Such and other (tricks) this impostor attempted to perform. And so it was that he was
magnified by his dupes, and sometimes he was supposed to utter predictions. But sometimes
he tried to make others (prophesy), partly by demons carrying on these operations, and
partly by practising sleight of hand, as we have previously stated. Hoodwinking therefore
multitudes, he led on (into enormities) many (dupes) of this description who had become
his disciples, by teaching them that they were prone, no doubt, to sin, but beyond the reach
of danger, from the fact of their belonging to the perfect power, and of their being participators
in the inconceivable potency. And subsequent to the (first) baptism, to these they
promise another, which they call Redemption. And by this (other baptism) they wickedly
subvert those that remain with them in expectation of redemption, as if persons, after they
had once been baptized, could again obtain remission. Now, it is by means of such knavery
as this that they seem to retain their hearers. And when they consider that these have been
tested, and are able to keep (secret the mysteries) committed unto them, they then admit
them to this (baptism). They, however, do not rest satisfied with this alone, but promise
(their votaries) some other (boon) for the purpose of confirming them in hope, in order
that they may be inseparable (adherents of their sect). For they utter something in an inexpressible
(tone of) voice, after having laid hands on him who is receiving the redemption.
And they allege that they could not easily declare (to another) what is thus spoken unless
one were highly tested, or one were at the hour of death, (when) the bishop comes and
whispers (it) into the (expiring one’s) ear. And this knavish device (is undertaken) for the
purpose of securing the constant attendance upon the bishop of (Marcus’) disciples, as individuals
eagerly panting to learn what that may be which is spoken at the last, by (the
knowledge of) which the learner will be advanced to the rank of those admitted into the
higher mysteries. And in regard of these I have maintained a silence for this reason, lest at
any time one should suppose that I was guilty of disparaging these (heretics). For this does
not come within the scope of our present work, only so far as it may contribute to prove
from what source (the heretics) have derived the standing-point from which they have taken
occasion to introduce the opinions advanced by them.734</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVII.—Marcus’ System Explained by Irenæus; Marcus’ Vision; The
Vision of Valentinus Revealing to Him His System.</head>
<p>For also the blessed presbyter Irenæus, having approached the subject of a refutation
in a more unconstrained spirit, has explained such washings and redemptions, stating more
in the way of a rough digest735 what are their practices. (And it appears that some of the
Marcosians,) on meeting with (Irenæus’ work), deny that they have so received (the secret
word just alluded to), but they have learned that always they should deny. Wherefore our
anxiety has been more accurately to investigate, and to discover minutely what are the (instructions)
which they deliver in the case of the first bath, styling it by some such name; and
in the case of the second, which they denominate Redemption. But not even has this secret
of theirs escaped (our scrutiny). For these opinions, however, we consent to pardon
Valentinus and his school.</p>
<p>But Marcus, imitating his teacher, himself also feigns a vision, imagining that in this
way he would be magnified. For Valentinus likewise alleges that he had seen an infant child
lately born; and questioning (this child), he proceeded to inquire who it might be. And (the
child) replied, saying that he himself is the Logos, and then subjoined a sort of tragic legend;
and out of this (Valentinus) wishes the heresy attempted by him to consist. Marcus, making
a similar attempt736 with this (heretic), asserts that the Tetrad came to him in the form of
a woman,—since the world could not bear, he says, the male (form) of this Tetrad, and that
she revealed herself who she was, and explained to this (Marcus) alone the generation of
the universe, which she never had revealed to any, either of gods or of men, expressing
herself after this mode: When first the self-existent Father, He who is inconceivable and
without substance, He who is neither male nor female, willed that His own ineffability should
become realized in something spoken, and that His invisibility should become realized in
form, He opened His mouth, and sent forth similar to Himself a Logos. And this (Logos)
stood by Him, and showed unto Him who he was, viz., that he himself had been manifested
as a (realization in) form of the Invisible One. And the pronunciation of the name was of

Summary of Heresies. Bunsen thinks that Hippolytus means to say that Irenæus expressed himself rather too
strongly, and that the Marcosians, on meeting with Irenæus’ assertions, indignantly repudiated them. Dr.

the following description. He was accustomed to utter the first word of the name itself,
which was Arche, and the syllable of this was (composed) of four737 letters. Then he subjoined
the second (syllable), and this was also (composed) of four letters. Next he uttered the third
(syllable), which was (composed) of ten letters; and he uttered the fourth (syllable), and this
was (composed) of twelve letters. Then ensued the pronunciation of the entire name,
(composed) of thirty letters, but of four syllables. And each of the elements had its own peculiar
letters, and its own peculiar form, and its own peculiar pronunciation, as well as figures
and images. And not one of these was there that beholds the form of that (letter) of which
this was an element. And of course none of them could know the pronunciation of the
(letter) next to this, but (only) as he himself pronounces it, (and that in such a way) as that,
in pronouncing the whole (word), he supposed that he was uttering the entire (name). For
each of these (elements), being part of the entire (name), he denominates (according to) its
own peculiar sound, as if the whole (of the word). And he does not intermit sounding until
he arrived at the last letter of the last element, and uttered it in a single articulation. Then
he said, that the restoration of the entire ensued when all the (elements), coming down into
the one letter, sounded one and the same pronunciation, and an image of the pronunciation
he supposed to exist when we simultaneously utter the word Amen.738 And that these sounds
are those which gave form to the insubstantial and unbegotten Æon, and that those forms
are what the Lord declared to be angels—the (forms) that uninterruptedly behold the face
of the Father.</p>

<p>But the generic and expressed names of the elements he called Æons, and Logoi, and
Roots, and Seeds, and Pleromas, and Fruits. (And he maintains) that every one of these, and
what was peculiar to each, is perceived as being contained in the name of “Ecclesia.” And
the final letter of the last element sent forth its own peculiar articulation. And the sound of
this (letter) came forth and produced, in accordance with images of the elements, its own
peculiar elements. And from these he says that things existing here were garnished, and the
things antecedent to these were produced. The letter itself certainly, of which the sound was
concomitant with the sound below, he says, was received up by its own syllable into the
complement of the entire (name); but that the sound, as if cast outside, remained below.
And that the element itself, from which the letter along with its own pronunciation descended
below, he says, is (composed) of thirty letters, and that each one of the thirty letters contains
in itself other letters, by means of which the title of the letter is named. And again, that the
other (letters) are named by different letters, and the rest by different (ones still). So that by
writing down the letters individually, the number would eventuate in infinity. In this way
one may more clearly understand what is spoken. The element Delta, (he says,) has five
letters in itself, (viz.), Delta, and Epsilon, and Lambda, and Tau, and Alpha; and these very
letters are (written) by means of other letters. If, therefore, the entire substance of the Delta
eventuates in infinity, (and if) different letters invariably produce different letters, and succeed
one another, by how much greater than that element is the more enormous sea739 of the
letters? And if one letter is thus infinite, behold the entire name’s depth of the letters out of
which the patient industry, nay, rather (I should say,) the vain toil of Marcus wishes that
the Progenitor (of things) should consist! Wherefore also (he maintains) that the Father,
who knew that He was inseparable from Himself, gave (this depth) to the elements, which
he likewise denominates Æons. And he uttered aloud to each one of them its own peculiar
pronunciation, from the fact that one could not pronounce the entire.</p>

as follows: “Now, I wish also to exhibit to you Truth herself, for I have brought her down
from the mansions above, in order that you may behold her naked, and become acquainted
with her beauty; nay, also that you may hear her speak, and may marvel at her wisdom.
Observe,” says the Quaternion, “then, first, the head above, Alpha (and long) O; the neck,
B and P[si]; shoulders, along with hands, G and C[hi]; breasts, Delta and P[hi]; diaphragm,740
Eu; belly, Z and T; pudenda, Eta and S; thighs, T[h] and R; knees, Ip; calves, Ko; ankles,
Lx[si]; feet, M and N.” This is in the body of Truth, according to Marcus. This is the figure
of the element; this the character of the letter. And he styles this element Man, and affirms
it to be the source of every word, and the originating principle of every sound, and the
realization in speech of everything that is ineffable, and a mouth of taciturn silence. And
this is the body of (Truth) herself. But do you, raising aloft the conceiving power of the understanding,

became a name, and that the name was that which we know and utter, viz., Christ Jesus,
and that as soon as she had named this (name) she remained silent. While Marcus, however,
was expecting that she was about to say more, the Quaternion, again advancing into the
midst, speaks as follows: “Thou didst regard as contemptible743 this discourse which you
have heard from the mouth of Truth. And yet this which you know and seem long since to
possess is not the name; for you have merely the sound of it, but are ignorant of the power.
For Jesus is a remarkable name, having six letters,744 invoked745 by all belonging to the
called (of Christ); whereas the other (name, that is, Christ,) consists of many parts, and is

<p>Know, (therefore,) that these letters which with you are (reckoned at) twenty-four, are
emanations from the three powers, and are representative746 of those (powers) which embrace
even the entire number of the elements. For suppose that there are some letters that are
mute—nine of them—of Pater and Aletheia, from the fact that these are mute—that is, ineffable
and unutterable. And (again, assume) that there are other (letters that are) semi-vowels—
eight of them—of the Logos and of Zoe, from the fact that these are intermediate
between consonants and vowels, and receive the emanation747 of the (letters) above them,
but the reflux of those below them.748 And (likewise take for granted) that there are vowels—
and these are seven—of Anthropos and Ecclesia, inasmuch as the voice of Anthropos
proceeded forth, and imparted form to the (objects of the) universe. For the sound of the
voice produced figure, and invested them with it. From this it follows that there are Logos
and Zoe, which have eight (semi-vowels); and Anthropos and Ecclesia, which have seven
(vowels); and Pater and Aletheia, which have nine (mutes). But from the fact that Logos
wanted749 (one of being an ogdoad), he who is in the Father was removed (from his seat on
God’s right hand), and came down (to earth). And he was sent forth (by the Father) to him
from whom he was separated, for the rectification of actions that had been committed. (And
his descent took place) in order that the unifying process, which is inherent in Agathos, of
the Pleromas might produce in all the single power that emanates from all. And thus he
who is of the seven (vowels) acquired the power of the eight750 (semi-vowels); and there
were produced three topoi, corresponding with the (three) numbers (nine, seven, and
eight),—(these topoi) being ogdoads. And these three being added one to the other, exhibited
the number of the twenty-four (letters). And (he maintains), of course, that the three elements,—(
which he himself affirms to be (allied) with the three powers by conjugal union,
and which (by this state of duality) become six, and from which have emanated the twentyfour
elements,—being rendered fourfold by the Quaternion’s ineffable word, produce the
same number (twenty-four) with these. And these, he says, belong to Anonomastus. And

<p>And he says, as the result of this computation and that proportion,751 that in the
similitude of an image He appeared who after the six days Himself ascended the mountain
a fourth person, and became the sixth.752 And (he asserts) that He (likewise) descended and
was detained by the Hebdomad, and thus became an illustrious Ogdoad. And He contains
in Himself of the elements the entire number which He manifested, as He came to His
baptism. (And the symbol of manifestation was) the descent of the dove, which is O[mega]
and Alpha, and which by the number manifested (by these is) 801.753 And for this reason
(he maintains) that Moses says that man was created on the sixth day. And (he asserts) that
the dispensation of suffering (took place) on the sixth day, which is the preparation; (and
so it was) that on this (day) appeared the last man for the regeneration of the first man. And
that the beginning and end of this dispensation is the sixth hour, at which He was nailed to
the (accursed) tree. For (he says) that perfect Nous, knowing the sixfold number to be possessed
of the power of production and regeneration, manifested to the sons of light the regeneration
that had been introduced into this number by that illustrious one who had appeared.

the seven powers,756 animation to this world, so as to make it consist of seven powers, and
constituted (this world) the soul of the visible universe. And therefore this one has resorted
to such all operation as what was spontaneously undertaken by Himself; and these minister,
757 inasmuch as they are imitations of things inimitable, unto the intelligence of the
Mother. And the first heaven sounds Alpha,758 and the one after that E[psilon], and the
third Eta, and the fourth, even that in the midst of the seven (vowels, enunciates) the power
of Iota, and the fifth of O[micron], and the sixth of U[psilon], and the seventh and fourth
from the central759 one, O[mega]. And all the powers, when they are connected together
in one, emit a sound, and glorify that (Being) from whom they have been projected. And
the glory of that sound is transmitted upwards to the Progenitor. And furthermore, he says
that the sound of this ascription of glory being conveyed to the earth, became a creator and
producer of terrestrial objects. And (he maintains) that the proof of this (may be drawn)
from the case of infants recently born, whose soul, simultaneously with exit from the womb
utters similarly this sound of each one of the elements. As, then, he says, the seven powers
glorify the Logos, so also does the sorrowing soul in babes (magnify Him).760 And on account
of this, he says, David likewise has declared, “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
Thou hast perfected praise.”761 And again, “The heavens declare the glory of God.”762
When,763 however, the soul is involved in hardships, it utters no other exclamation than
the O[mega], inasmuch as it is afflicted in order that the soul above, becoming aware of
what is akin to herself (below), may send down one to help this (earthly soul).</p>

<head>Chapter XLIV.—Respecting the Generation of the Twenty-Four Letters.</head>
<p>And so far for these points. Respecting, however, the generation of the twenty-four
elements, he expresses himself thus: that Henotes coexists with Monotes, and that from
these issue two projections, viz., Monas and Hen, and that these being added together764
become four, for twice two are four. And again, the two and four (projections) being added
together, manifested the number six; and these six made fourfold, produce the twenty-four
forms.765 And these are the names of the first tetrad, and they are understood as Holy of
Holies, and cannot be expressed and they are recognised by the Son alone. These the Father
knows which they are. Those names which with Him are pronounced in silence and with
faith, are Arrhetus and Sige, Pater and Aletheia. And of this tetrad the entire number is
(that) of twenty-four letters. For Arrhetus has seven elements, Sige five, and Pater five, and
Aletheia seven.766 And in like manner also (is it with) the second tetrad; (for) Logos and
Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia, exhibited the same number of elements. And (he says) that
the expressed name—(that is, Jesus)767—of the Saviour consists of six letters, but that His
ineffable768 name, according to the number of the letters, one by one,769 consists of twentyfour
elements, but Christ a Son of twelve. And (he says) that the ineffable (name) in Christ
consists of thirty letters, and this exists, according to the letters which are in Him, the elements
being counted one by one. For the (name) Christ770 consists of eight elements; for
Chi771 consists of three, and R[ho] of two, and EI of two, and I[ota], of four, S[igma] of five,
and T[au] of three, and OU of two, and San of three. Thus the ineffable name in Christ
consists, they allege, of thirty letters. And they assert that for this reason He utters the words,

<head>Chapter XLV.—Why Jesus is Called Alpha.</head>
<p>Now Jesus possesses this ineffable generation. For from the mother of the universe, I
mean the first tetrad, proceeded forth, in the manner of a daughter, the second tetrad. And
it became an ogdoad, from which proceeded forth the decade; and thus was produced ten,
and next eighteen. The decade, therefore, coming in along with the ogdoad, and rendering
it tenfold, produced the number eighty; and again making eighty tenfold, generated the
number eight hundred.773 And so it is that the entire number of letters that proceeded forth
from ogdoad into decade is eight hundred and eighty-eight, which is Jesus; for the name
Jesus, according to the number in letters, is eight hundred and eighty-eight. Now likewise
the Greek alphabet has eight monads and eight decades, and eight hecatontads; and these
exhibit the calculated sum of eight hundred and eighty-eight, that is, Jesus, who consists of
all numbers. And that on this account He is called Alpha (and Omega), indicating His
generation (to be) from all.774</p>

<p>But concerning the creation of this (Jesus), he expresses himself thus: That powers emanating
from the second tetrad fashioned Jesus, who appeared on earth, and that the angel
Gabriel775 filled the place of the Logos, and the Holy Spirit that of Zoe, and the “Power of
the Highest”776 that of Anthropos, and the Virgin that of Ecclesia.777 And so it was, in
Marcus’ system, that the man (who appeared) in accordance with the dispensation was born
through Mary.778 And when He came to the water, (he says) that He descended like a dove
upon him who had ascended above and filled the twelfth number. And in Him resides the
seed of these, that is, such as are sown along with Him, and that descend with (Him), and
ascend with (Him). And that this power which descended upon Him, he says, is the seed of
the Pleroma, which contains in itself both the Father and the Son, and the unnameable
power of Sige, which is recognised through these and all the Æons. And that this (seed) is
the spirit which is in Him and spoke in Him through the mouth of the Son, the confession
of Himself as Son of man, and of His being one who would manifest the Father; (and that)
when this spirit came down upon Jesus, He was united with Him. The Saviour, who was of
the dispensation, he says, destroyed death, whereas He made known (as) the Father Christ
(Jesus). He says that Jesus, therefore, is the name of the man of the dispensation, and that
it has been set forth for the assimilation and formation of Anthropos, who was about to
descend upon Him; and that when He had received Him unto Himself, He retained possession
of Him. And (he says) that He was Anthropos, (that) He (was) Logos, (that) He (was)
Pater, and Arrhetus, and Sige, and Aletheia, and Ecclesia, and Zoe.</p>

<head>Chapter XLVII.—The System of Marcus Shown to Be that of Pythagoras, by Quotations
from the Writings of Marcus’ Followers.</head>
<p>I trust, therefore, that as regards these doctrines it is obvious to all possessed of a sound
mind, that (these tenets) are unauthoritative, and far removed from the knowledge that is
in accordance with Religion, and are mere portions of astrological discovery, and the
arithmetical art of the Pythagoreans. And this assertion, ye who are desirous of learning
shall ascertain (to be true, by a reference to the previous books, where,) amongst other
opinions elucidated by us, we have explained these doctrines likewise. In order, however,
that we may prove it a more clear statement, viz., that these (Marcosians) are disciples not
of Christ but of Pythagoras, I shall proceed to explain those opinions that have been derived
(by these heretics) from Pythagoras concerning the meteoric (phenomena) of the stars779
as far as it is possible (to do so) by an epitome.</p>
<p>Now the Pythagoreans make the following statements: that the universe consists of a
Monad and Duad, and that by reckoning from a monad as far as four they thus generate a
decade. And again,780 a duad coming forth as far as the remarkable (letter),—for instance,
two and four and six,—exhibited the (number) twelve. And again, if we reckon from the
duad to the decade, thirty is produced; and in this are comprised the ogdoad, and decade,
and dodecade. And therefore, on account of its having the remarkable (letter), the dodecade
has concomitant781 with it a remarkable passion.782 And for this reason (they maintain)
that when an error had arisen respecting the twelfth number, the sheep skipped from the
flock and wandered away;783 for that the apostasy took place, they say, in like manner from
the decade. And with a similar reference to the dodecade, they speak of the piece of money
<note type="footnote">779 Cruice thinks that for stars we should read “numbers,” but gives no explanation of the meaning of μετέωρα.
This word, as applied to numbers, might refer to “the astrological phenomena” deducible by means of numerical
calculations.</note>
<note type="footnote">780 A comparison of Hippolytus with Irenæus, as regards what follows, manifests many omissions in the
former.</note>
<note type="footnote">781 Following Irenæus, the passage would be rendered thus: “And therefore, on account of its having the
remarkable (letter) concomitant with it, they style the dodecade a remarkable passion.” Massuet, in his Annotations
on Irenæus, gives the following explanation of the above statement, which is made by Hippolytus likewise. From
the twelfth number, by once abstracting the remarkable (number), which does not come into the order and
number of the letters, eleven letters remain. Hence in the dodecade, the πάθος, or what elsewhere the heretics
call the “Hysterema,” is a defect of one letter. And this is a symbol of the defect or suffering which, upon the
withdrawal of one Æon, happened unto the last dodecade of Æons.</note>
<note type="footnote">782 Hippolytus’ statement is less copious and less clear than that of Irenæus, who explains the defect of the
letter to be symbolical of an apostasy of one of the Æons, and that this one was a female.</note>
<note type="footnote">783 Luke xv. 4–10.</note>

which, on losing, a woman, having lit a candle, searched for diligently. (And they make a
similar application) of the loss (sustained) in the case of the one sheep out of the ninety and
nine; and adding these one into the other, they give a fabulous account of numbers. And in
this way, they affirm, when the eleven is multiplied into nine, that it produces the number
ninety and nine; and on this account that it is said that the word Amen embraces the number
ninety-nine. And in regard of another number they express themselves in this manner: that
the letter Eta along with the remarkable one constitutes an ogdoad, as it is situated in the
eighth place from Alpha. Then, again, computing the number of these elements without
the remarkable (letter), and adding them together up to Eta, they exhibit the number thirty.
For any one beginning from the Alpha784 to the Eta will, after subtracting the remarkable
(letter), discover the number of the elements to be the number thirty. Since, therefore, the
number thirty is unified from the three powers; when multiplied thrice into itself it produced
ninety, for thrice thirty is ninety, (and this triad when multiplied into itself produced nine).
In this way the Ogdoad brought forth the number ninety-nine from the first Ogdoad, and
Decade, and Dodecade. And at one time they collect the number of this (trio) into an entire
sum, and produce a triacontad; whereas at another time they subtract twelve, and reckon
it at eleven. And in like manner, (they subtract) ten and make it nine. And connecting these
one into the other, and multiplying them tenfold, they complete the number ninety-nine.
Since, however, the twelfth Æon, having left the eleven (Æons above), and departing
downwards, withdrew, they allege that even this is correlative (with the letters). For the
figure of the letters teaches (us as much). For L is placed eleventh of the letters, and this L
is the number thirty. And (they say) that this is placed according to an image of the dispensation
above; since from Alpha, irrespective of the remarkable (letter), the number of the
letters themselves, added together up to L, according to the augmentation of the letters with
the L itself, produces the number ninety-nine. But that the L, situated in the eleventh (of
the alphabet), came down to search after the number similar to itself, in order that it might
fill up the twelfth number, and that when it was discovered it was filled up, is manifest from
the shape itself of the letter. For Lambda, when it attained unto, as it were, the investigation
of what is similar to itself, and when it found such and snatched it away, filled up the place
of the twelfth, the letter M, which is composed of two Lambdas. And for this reason (it was)
that these (adherents of Marcus), through their knowledge, avoid the place of the ninetynine,
that is, the Hysterema, a type of the left hand,785 and follow after the one which, added
to ninety-nine, they say was transferred to his own right hand.</p>
<note type="footnote">784 Marcus’ explanation of this, as furnished by Irenæus, is more copious than Hippolytus’.</note>
<note type="footnote">785 The allusion here seems to be to the habit among the ancients of employing the fingers for counting,
those of the left hand being used for all numbers under 100, and those of the right for the numbers above it. To
this custom the poet Juvenal alludes, when he says of Nestor:— Atque suos jam dextera computat annos. That
is, that he was one hundred years old.</note>

<p>And by the Mother, they allege, were created first the four elements, which, they say,
are fire, water, earth, air; and these have been projected as an image of the tetrad above; and
reckoning the energies of these—for instance, as hot, cold, moist, dry—they assert that they
accurately portray the Ogdoad. And next they compute ten powers thus. (There are, they
say,) seven orbicular bodies, which they likewise call heavens. There is next a circle containing
these within its compass, and this also they name an eighth heaven: and in addition to these,
they affirm the existence of both a sun and moon. And these being ten in number, they say,
are images of the invisible decade that (emanated) from Logos and Zoe. (They affirm,)
however, that the dodecade is indicated by what is termed the zodiacal circle. For these
twelve zodiacal signs, they say, most evidently shadowed forth786 the daughter of Anthropos
and Ecclesia, namely the Dodecade. And since, he says, the upper heaven has been united
from an opposite direction to the revolutionary motion, which is most rapid, of the entire
(of the signs); and since (this heaven) within its cavity retards, and by its slowness counterpoises,
the velocity of those (signs), so that in thirty years it accomplishes its circuit from
sign to sign,—they therefore assert that this (heaven) is an image of Horos, who encircles
the mother of these, who has thirty names. And, again, (they affirm) that the moon, which
traverses the heaven in thirty days, by reason of (these) days portrays the number of the
Æons. And (they say) that the sun, performing its circuit, and terminating its exact return
to its first position in its orbit in twelve months, manifests the dodecade. And also (they
say) that the days themselves, involving the measure of twelve hours, constitute a type of
the empty787 dodecade; and that the circumference of the actual zodiacal circle consists of
three hundred and sixty degrees, and that each zodiacal sign possesses thirty divisions. In
this way, therefore, even by means of the circle, they maintain that the image is preserved788
of the connection of the twelve with the thirty.789 But, moreover, alleging that the earth was
divided into twelve regions, and that according to each particular region it receives one

Moral from Ulysses and the Sirens.</head>
<p>The pupils of these men, when they perceive the doctrines of the heretics to be like unto
the ocean when tossed into waves by violence of the winds, ought to sail past in quest of the
tranquil haven. For a sea of this description is both infested with wild beasts and difficult
of navigation, like, as we may say, the Sicilian (Sea), in which the legend reports were Cyclops,
and Charybdis, and Scylla, and the rock801 of the Sirens. Now, the poets of the Greeks allege
that Ulysses sailed through (this channel), adroitly using (to his own purpose) the terribleness
of these strange monsters.802 For the savage cruelty (in the aspect) of these towards those
who were sailing through was remarkable. The Sirens, however, singing sweetly and harmoniously,
beguiled the voyagers, luring, by reason of their melodious voice, those who heard
it, to steer their vessels towards (the promontory). The (poets) report that Ulysses, on ascertaining
this, smeared with wax the ears of his companions, and, lashing himself to the mast,
sailed, free of danger, past the Sirens, hearing their chant distinctly. And my advice to my
readers is to adopt a similar expedient, viz., either on account of their infirmity to smear
their ears with wax, and sail (straight on) through the tenets of the heretics, not even
listening to (doctrines) that are easily capable of enticing them into pleasure, like the luscious
lay of the Sirens, or, by binding one’s self to the Cross803 of Christ, (and) hearkening with
fidelity (to His words), not to be distracted, inasmuch as he has reposed his trust in Him to
whom ere this he has been firmly knit, and (I admonish that man) to continue stedfastly

<head>Chapter III.—Sketch of Aristotle’s Philosophy.</head>
<p>Aristotle, then, makes a threefold division of substance. For one portion of it is a certain
genus, and another a certain species, as that (philosopher) expresses it, and a third a certain
individual. What is individual, however, (is so) not through any minuteness of body, but
because by nature it cannot admit of any division whatsoever. The genus, on the other hand,
is a sort of aggregate, made up of many and different germs. And from this genus, just as
(from) a certain heap, all the species of existent things derive their distinctions.805 And the
genus constitutes a competent cause for (the production of) all generated entities. In order,
however, that the foregoing statement may be clear, I shall prove (my position) through an
example. And by means of this it will be possible for us to retrace our steps over the entire
speculation of the Peripatetic (sage).</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Aristotle’s General Idea.</head>
<p>We affirm the existence of animal absolutely, not some animal. And this animal is
neither ox, nor horse, nor man, nor god; nor is it significant of any of these at all, but is animal
absolutely. From this animal the species of all particular animals derive their subsistence.
And this animality, itself the summum genus,806 constitutes (the originating principle) for
all animals produced in those (particular) species, and (yet is) not (itself any one) of the
things generated. For man is an animal deriving the principle (of existence) from that animality,
and horse is an animal deriving the principle of existence from that animality. The
horse, and ox, and dog, and each of the rest of the animals, derive the principle (of existence)
from the absolute animal, while animality itself is not any of these.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Nonentity as a Cause.</head>
<p>If, however, this animality is not any of these (species), the subsistence, according to
Aristotle, of the things that are generated, derived its reality from non-existent entities. For
animality, from whence these singly have been derived, is not any one (of them); and though
it is not any one of them, it has yet become some one originating principle of existing things.
But who it is that has established this substance as an originating cause of what is subsequently
produced, we shall declare when we arrive at the proper place for entertaining a discussion
of this sort.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="266"/>
<head>Chapter VI.—Substance, According to Aristotle; The Predicates.</head>
<p>Since, however, as I have stated, substance is threefold, viz., genus, species, (and) individual;
and (since) we have set down animality as being the genus, and man the species, as
being already distinct from the majority of animals, but notwithstanding still to be identified
(with animals of his own kind), inasmuch as not being yet moulded into a species of realized
substance,—(therefore it is, that) when I impart form under a name to a man derived from
the genus, I style him Socrates or Diogenes, or some one of the many denominations (in
use). And since (in this way, I repeat,) I comprehend under a name the man who constitutes
a species that is generated from the genus, I denominate a substance of this description individual.
For genus has been divided into species, and species into individual. But (as regards)
the individual, since it has been comprehended under a name, it is not possible that, according
to its own nature, it could be divided into anything else, as we have divided each of the forementioned
(genus and species).807</p>
<p>Aristotle primarily, and especially, and preeminently entitles this—substance, inasmuch
as it cannot either be predicated of any Subject, or exist in a Subject. He, however, predicates
of the Subject, just as with the genus, what I said constituted animality, (and which is) predicated
by means of a common name of all particular animals, such as ox, horse, and the
rest that are placed under (this genus). For it is true to say that man is an animal, and horse
an animal, and that ox is an animal, and each of the rest. Now the meaning of the expression
“predicated of a Subject” is this, that inasmuch as it is one, it can be predicated in like
manner of many (particulars), even though these happen to be diversified in species. For
neither does horse nor ox differ from man so far forth as he is an animal, for the definition
of animal is said to suit all animals alike. For what is an animal? If we define it, a general
definition will comprehend all animals. For animal is an animated Substance, endued with
Sensation. Such are ox, man, horse, and each of the rest (of the animal kingdom). But the
meaning of the expression “in a Subject” is this, that what is inherent in anything, not as a
part, it is impossible should exist separately from that in which it is. But this constitutes
each of the accidents (resident) in Substance, and is what is termed Quality. Now, according
to this, we say that certain persons are of such a quality; for instance, white, grey, black, just,
unjust, temperate, and other (characteristics) similar to these. But it is impossible for any
one of these to subsist itself by itself; but it must inhere in something else. If, however, neither
animal which I predicate of all individual animals, nor accidents which are discoverable in
all things of which they are nonessential qualities, can subsist themselves by themselves,
and (yet if) individuals are formed out of these, (it follows, therefore, that) the triply divided
Substance, which is not made up out of other things, consists of nonentities. If, then, what
<note type="footnote">807 Aristotle’s Categ., c. v.</note>

<pb n="267"/>
is primarily, and pre-eminently, and particularly denominated Substance consists of these,
it derives existence from nonentities, according to Aristotle.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Aristotle’s Cosmogony; His “Psychology;” His “Entelecheia;” His
Theology; His Ethics; Basilides Follows Aristotle.</head>
<p>But concerning Substance, the statements now made will suffice. But not only is Substance
denominated genus, species, (and) individual, but also matter, and form, and privation.
There is, however, (as regards the substance,) in these no difference, even though the division
be allowed to stand. Now, inasmuch as Substance is of this description, the arrangement of
the world has taken place according to some such plan as the following. The world is divided,
according to Aristotle, into very numerous and diversified parts. Now the portion of the
world which extends from the earth to the moon is devoid of foresight, guideless, and is
under the sway808 of that nature alone which belongs to itself. But another (part of the world
which lies) beyond the moon, and extends to the surface of heaven, is arranged in the midst
of all order and foresight and governance. Now, the (celestial) superficies constitutes a certain
fifth substance, and is remote from all those natural elements out of which the cosmical
system derives consistence. And this is a certain fifth Substance, according to Aristotle,—as
it were, a certain super-mundane essence. And (this essence) has become (a logical necessity)
in his system, in order to accord with the (Peripatetic) division of the world. And (the topic
of this fifth nature) constitutes a distinct investigation in philosophy. For there is extant a
certain disquisition, styled A Lecture on Physical (Phenomena), in which he has elaborately
treated809 concerning the operations which are conducted by nature and not providence,
(in the quarter of space extending) from the earth as far as the moon. And there is also extant
by him a certain other peculiar treatise on the principles of things (in the region) beyond
the moon, and it bears the following inscription: Metaphysics.810 And another peculiar
dissertation has been (written) by him, entitled Concerning a Fifth Substance, and in this
work Aristotle unfolds his theological opinions.</p>
<p>There exists some such division of the universe as we have now attempted to delineate
in outline, and (corresponding with it is the division) of the Aristotelian philosophy. His
work, however, (styled) Concerning the Soul, is obscure. For in the entire three books (where
he treats of this subject) it is not possible to say clearly what is Aristotle’s opinion concerning
the soul. For, as regards the definition which he furnishes of soul, it is easy (enough) to declare
this; but what it is that is signified by the definition811 is difficult to discover. For soul, he
says, is an entelecheia of a natural organic body; (but to explain) what this is at all, would
require a very great number of arguments and a lengthened investigation. As regards,

<pb n="269"/>
however, the Deity, the Originator of all those glorious objects in creation, (the nature of)
this (First Cause)—even to one conducting his speculations by a more prolonged inquiry
than that concerning (the soul)—is more difficult to know than the soul itself. The definition,
however, which Aristotle furnishes of the Deity is, I admit, not difficult to ascertain, but it
is impossible to comprehend the meaning of it. For, he says, (the Deity) is a “conception of
conception;” but this is altogether a non-existent (entity). The world, however, is incorruptible
(and) eternal, according to Aristotle. For it has in itself nothing faulty,812 inasmuch as it is
directed by Providence and Nature. And Aristotle has laid down doctrines not only concerning
Nature and a cosmical system, and Providence, and God,813 but he has written (more
than this); for there is extant by him likewise a certain treatise on ethical subjects, and these
he inscribes Books of Ethics.814 But throughout these he aims at rendering the habits of his
hearers excellent from being worthless. When, therefore, Basilides has been discovered, not
in spirit alone, but also in the actual expressions and names, transferring the tenets of Aristotle
into our evangelical and saving doctrine, what remains, but that, by restoring what he
has appropriated from others, we should prove to the disciples of this (heretic) that Christ
will in no wise profit them, inasmuch as they are heathenish?</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Basilides and Isidorus Allege Apostolic Sanction for Their Systems;
They Really Follow Aristotle.</head>
<p>Basilides, therefore, and Isidorus, the true son and disciple of Basilides, say that Matthias815
communicated to them secret discourses, which, I being specially instructed, he heard
from the Saviour. Let us, then, see how clearly Basilides, simultaneously with Isidorus, and
the entire band of these (heretics), not only absolutely belies Matthias, but even the Saviour
Himself. (Time) was, says (Basilides), when there was nothing. Not even, however, did that
nothing constitute anything of existent things; but, to express myself undisguisedly and
candidly, and without any quibbling, it is altogether nothing. But when, he says, I employ
the expression “was,” I do not say that it was; but (I speak in this way) in order to signify
the meaning of what I wish to elucidate. I affirm then, he says, that it was “altogether nothing.”
For, he says, that is not absolutely ineffable which is named (so),—although undoubtedly
we call this ineffable,—but that which is “non-ineffable.” For that which is “non-ineffable”
is not denominated ineffable, but is, he says, above every name that is named. For, he says,
by no means for the world are these names sufficient, but so manifold are its divisions that
there is a deficiency (of names). And I do not take it upon myself to discover, he says,
proper denominations for all things. Undoubtedly, however, one ought mentally, not by
means of names, to conceive, after an ineffable manner, the peculiarities (of things) denominated.
For an equivocal terminology, (when employed by teachers,) has created for their
pupils confusion and a source of error concerning objects. (The Basilidians), in the first
instance, laying hold on this borrowed and furtively derived tenet from the Peripatetic (sage),
play upon the folly of those who herd together with them. For Aristotle, born many generations
before Basilides, first lays down a system in The Categories concerning homonymous
words. And these heretics bring this (system) to light as if it were peculiarly their own, and
as if it were some novel (doctrine), and some secret disclosure from the discourses of Matthias.

<head>Chapter IX.—Basilides Adopts the Aristotelian Doctrine of “Nonentity.”</head>
<p>Since, therefore, “nothing” existed,—(I mean) not matter, nor substance, nor what is
insubstantial, nor is absolute, nor composite,817 (nor conceivable, nor inconceivable, (nor
what is sensible,) nor devoid of senses, nor man, nor angel, nor a god, nor, in short, any of
those objects that have names, or are apprehended by sense, or that are cognised by intellect,
but (are) thus (cognised), even with greater minuteness, still, when all things are absolutely
removed,—(since, I say, “nothing” existed,) God, “non-existent,”—whom Aristotle styles
“conception of conception,” but these (Basilidians) “non-existent,”—inconceivably, insensibly,
indeterminately, involuntarily, impassively, (and) unactuated by desire, willed to create
a world. Now I employ, he says, the expression “willed” for the purpose of signifying (that
he did so) involuntarily, and inconceivably, and insensibly. And by the expression “world”
I do not mean that which was subsequently formed according to breadth and division, and
which stood apart; nay, (far from this,) for (I mean) the germ of a world. The germ, however,
of the world had all things in itself. Just as the grain of mustard comprises all things simultaneously,
holding them (collected) together within the very smallest (compass), viz., roots,
stem, branches, leaves, and innumerable gains which are produced from the plant, (as) seeds
again of other plants, and frequently of others (still), that are produced (from them). In this
way, “non-existent” God made the world out of nonentities, casting and depositing some
one Seed that contained in itself a conglomeration of the germs of the world. But in order
that I may render more clear what it is those (heretics) affirm, (I shall mention the following
illustration of theirs.) As an egg of some variegated and particoloured bird,—for instance
the peacock, or some other (bird) still more manifold and particoloured,—being one in
reality, contains in itself numerous forms of manifold, and particoloured, and much compounded
substances; so, he says, the nonexistent seed of the world, which has been deposited
by the non-existent God, constitutes at the same time the germ of a multitude of forms and
a multitude of substances.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Origin of the World; Basilides’ Account of the “Sonship.”</head>
<p>All things, therefore whatsoever it is possible to declare, and whatever, being not as yet
discovered, one must omit, were likely to receive adaptation to the world which was about
to be generated from the Seed. And this (Seed), at the requisite seasons, increases in bulk
in a peculiar manner, according to accession, as through the instrumentality of a Deity so
great, and of this description. (But this Deity) the creature can neither express nor grasp by
perception. (Now, all these things) were inherent, treasured in the Seed, as we afterwards
observe in a new-born child the growth of teeth, and paternal substance, and intellect, and
everything which, though previously having no existence, accrues unto a man, growing little
by little, from a youthful period of life. But since it would be absurd to say that any projection
of a non-existent God became anything non-existent (for Basilides altogether shuns and
dreads the Substances of things generated in the way of projection for, (he asks,) of what
sort of projection is there a necessity, or of what sort of matter818 must we assume the previous
existence, in order that God should construct a world, as the spider his web; or (as) a
mortal man, for the purpose of working it, takes a (piece of) brass or of wood, or some
other of the parts of matter?),—(projection, I say, being out of the question,) certainly, says
(Basilides), God spoke the word, and it was carried into effect. And this, as these men assert,
is that which has been stated by Moses: “Let there be light, and there was light.”819 Whence
he says, came the light? From nothing. For it has not been written, he says, whence, but this
only, (that it came) from the voice of him who speaks the word. And he who speaks the
word, he says, was non-existent; nor was that existent which was being produced.820 The
seed of the cosmical system was generated, he says, from nonentities; (and I mean by the
seed,) the word which was spoken, “Let there be light.” And this, he says, is that which has
been stated in the Gospels: “He was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world.”821 He derives his originating principles from that Seed, and obtains from
the same source his illuminating power. This is that seed which has in itself the entire conglomeration
of germs. And Aristotle affirms this to be genius, and it is distributed by him
into infinite species; just as from animal, which is non-existent, we sever ox, horse, (and)
man. When, therefore, the cosmical Seed becomes the basis (for a subsequent development),
those (heretics) assert, (to quote Basilides’ own words:) “Whatsoever I affirm,” he says, “to
have been made after these, ask no question as to whence. For (the Seed) had all seeds
treasured and reposing in itself, just as non-existent entities, and which were designed to
be produced by a non-existent Deity.”</p>

<pb n="273"/>
<p>Let us see, therefore, what they say is first, or what second, or what third, (in the development
of) what is generated from the cosmical Seed. There existed, he says, in the Seed itself,
a Sonship, threefold, in every respect of the same Substance with the non-existent God,
(and) begotten from nonentities. Of this Sonship (thus) involving a threefold division, one
part was refined, (another gross,) and another requiring purification. The refined portion,
therefore, in the first place, simultaneously with the earliest deposition of the Seed by the
non-existent one, immediately burst forth822 and went upwards and hurried above from
below, employing a sort of velocity described in poetry,—
<lg>
<l>“…As wing or thought,”823—</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>and attained, he says, unto him that is nonexistent. For every nature desires that
(nonexistent one), on account of a superabundance of beauty and bloom. Each (nature desires
this), however, after a different mode. The more gross portion, however, (of the Sonship)
continuing still in the Seed, (and) being a certain imitative (principle), was not able to hurry
upwards. For (this portion) was much more deficient in the refinement that the Sonship
possessed, which through itself hurried upwards, (and so the more gross portion) was left
behind. Therefore the more gross Sonship equipped itself with some such wing as Plato,
the Preceptor of Aristotle, fastens on the soul in (his) Phædrus.824 And Basilides styles such,
not a wing, but Holy Spirit; and Sonship invested in this (Spirit) confers benefits, and receives
them in turn. He confers benefits, because, as a wing of a bird, when removed from the bird,
would not of itself soar high up and aloft; nor, again, would a bird, when disengaged from
its pinion, at any time soar high up and aloft; (so, in like manner,) the Sonship involved
some such relation in reference to the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit in reference to the Sonship.
For the Sonship, carried upwards by the Spirit as by a wing, bears aloft (in turn) its pinion,
that is, the Spirit. And it approaches the refined Sonship, and the non-existent God,825 even
Him who fabricated the world out of nonentities. He was not, (however,) able to have this
(spirit) with (the Sonship) itself; for it was not of the same substance (with God), nor has it
(any) nature (in common) with the Sonship. But as pure and dry air is contrary to (their)
nature, and destructive to fishes; so, in contrariety to the nature of the Holy Spirit, was that
place simultaneously of non-existent Deity and Sonship,—(a place) more ineffable than
ineffable (entities), and higher up than all names.</p>

<pb n="274"/>
<p>Sonship, therefore, left this (spirit) near that Blessed Place, which cannot be conceived
or represented by any expression. (He left the spirit) not altogether deserted or separated
from the Sonship; nay, (far from it,) for it is just as when a most fragrant ointment is put
into a vessel, that, even though (the vessel) be emptied (of it) with ever so much care, nevertheless
some odour of the ointment still remains, and is left behind, even after (the ointment)
is separated from the vessel; and the vessel retains an odour of ointment, though (it contain)
not the ointment (itself). So the Holy Spirit has continued without any share in the Sonship,
and separated (from it), and has in itself, similarly with ointment, its own power, a savour
of Sonship. And this is what has been declared: “As the ointment upon the head which
descended to the beard of Aaron.”826 This is the savour from the Holy Spirit borne down
from above, as far as formlessness, and the interval (of space) in the vicinity of our world.
And from this the Son began to ascend, sustained as it were, says (Basilides), upon eagles’
wings, and upon the back. For, he says, all (entities) hasten upwards from below, from things
inferior to those that are superior. For not one of those things that are among things superior,
is so silly as to descend beneath. The third Sonship, however, that which requires purification,
has continued, he says, in the vast conglomeration of all germs conferring benefits
and receiving them. But in what manner it is that (the third Sonship) receives benefits and
confers them, we shall afterwards declare when we come to the proper place for discussing
this question.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The “Great Archon” Of Basilides.</head>
<p>When, therefore, a first and second ascension of the Sonship took place, and the Holy
Spirit itself also remained after the mode mentioned, the firmament was placed between
the super-mundane (spaces) and the world. For existing things were distributed by Basilides
into two continuous and primary divisions, and are, according to him, denominated partly
in a certain (respect) world, and partly in a certain (respect) super-mundane (spaces). But
the spirit, a line of demarcation between the world and super-mundane (spaces), is that
which is both holy, and has abiding in itself the savour of Sonship. While, therefore, the
firmament which is above the heaven is coming into existence, there burst forth, and was
begotten from the cosmical Seed, and the conglomeration of all germs, the Great Archon
(and) Head of the world, (who constitutes) a certain (species of) beauty, and magnitude,
and indissoluble power.827 For, says he, he is more ineffable than ineffable entities, and
more potent than potent ones, and more wise than wise ones, and superior to all the beautiful
ones whatever you could mention. This (Archon), when begotten, raised Himself up
and soared aloft, and was carried up entire as far as the firmament. And there He paused,
supposing the firmament to be the termination of His ascension and elevation, and considering
that there existed nothing at all beyond these. And than all the subjacent (entities)
whatsoever there were among them which remained mundane, He became more wise, more
powerful, more comely, more lustrous, (in fact,) pre-eminent for beauty above any entities
you could mention with the exception of the Sonship alone, which is still left in the (conglomeration
of) all germs. For he was not aware that there is (a Sonship) wiser and more
powerful, and better than Himself. Therefore imagining Himself to be Lord, and Governor,
and a wise Master Builder, He turns Himself to (the work of) the creation of every object
in the cosmical system. And first, he deemed it proper not to be alone, but made unto
Himself, and generated from adjacent (entities), a Son far superior to Himself, and wiser.
For all these things had the non-existent Deity previously determined upon, when He cast
down the (conglomeration of) all germs. Beholding, therefore, the Son, He was seized with
astonishment, and loved (Him), and was struck with amazement. For some beauty of this
description appeared828 to the Great Archon to belong to the Son, and the Archon caused
Him to sit on his right (hand). This is, according to these (heretics), what is denominated
the Ogdoad, where the Great Archon has his throne. The entire celestial creation, then, that
is, the Æther, He Himself, the Great Wise Demiurge formed. The Son, however, begotten
of this (Archon), operates in Him, and offered Him suggestions, being endued with far
greater wisdom than the Demiurge Himself.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Basilides Adopts the “Entelecheia” Of Aristotle.</head>
<p>This, then, constitutes the entelecheiaof the natural organic body, according to Aristotle,
(viz.,) a soul operating in the body, without which the body is able to accomplish nothing;
(I mean nothing) that is greater, and more illustrious, and more powerful, and more wise
than the body.829 The account, therefore, which Aristotle has previously rendered concerning
the soul and the body, Basilides elucidates as applied to the Great Archon and his Son. For
the Archon has generated, according to Basilides, a son; and the soul as an operation and
completion, Aristotle asserts to be an entelecheia of a natural organic body. As, therefore,
the entelecheia controls the body, so the Son, according to Basilides, controls the God that
is more ineffable than ineffable (entities). All things, therefore, have been provided for, and
managed by the majesty830 of the Great Archon; (I mean) whatever objects exist in the
æthereal region of space as far as the moon, for from that quarter onwards air is separated
from æther. When all objects in the æthereal regions, then, were arranged, again from (the
conglomeration of) all germs another Archon ascended, greater, of course, than all subjacent
(entities), with the exception, however, of the Sonship that had been left behind, but far inferior
to the First Archon. And this (second Archon) is called by them Rhetus.831 And this
Topos is styled Hebdomad, and this (Archon) is the manager and fabricator of all subjacent
(entities). And He has likewise made unto Himself out (of the conglomeration of) all germs,
a son who is more prudent and wise than Himself, similarly to what has been stated to have
taken place in the case of the First Archon. That which exists in this quarter (of the universe)
constitutes, he says, the actual conglomeration and collection of all seeds; and the things
which are generated are produced according to nature, as has been declared already by Him
who calculates on things future, when they ought832 (to be), and what sort they ought (to
be), and how they ought (to be). And of these no one is Chief, or Guardian, or Creator. For
(a) sufficient (cause of existence) for them is that calculation which the Non-Existent One
formed when He exercised the function of creation.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Further Explanation of the “Sonship.”</head>
<p>When, therefore, according to these (heretics), the entire world and super-mundane
entities were finished, and (when) nothing exists labouring under deficiency, there still remains
in the (conglomeration of) all germs the third Sonship, which had been left behind
in the Seed to confer benefits and receive them. And it must needs be that the Sonship which
had been left behind ought likewise to be revealed and reinstated above. And His place
should be above the Conterminous Spirit, near the refined and imitative Sonship and the
Non-Existent One. But this would be in accordance with what has been written, he says:
“And the creation itself groaneth together, and travaileth in pain together, waiting for the
manifestation of the sons of God.”833 Now, we who are spiritual are sons, he says, who have
been left here to arrange, and mould, and rectify, and complete the souls which, according
to nature, are so constituted as to continue in this quarter of the universe. “Sin, then, reigned
from Adam unto Moses,”834 as it has been written. For the Great Archon exercised
dominion and possesses an empire with limits extending as far as the firmament. And He
imagines Himself alone to be God, and that there exists nothing above Him, for (the reason
that) all things have been guarded by unrevealed Siope. This, he says, is the mystery which
has not been made known to former generations; but in those days the Great Archon, the
Ogdoad, was King and Lord, as it seemed, of the universe. But (in reality) the Hebdomad
was king and lord of this quarter of the universe, and the Ogdoad is Arrhetus, whereas the
Hebdomad is Rhetus. This, he says, is the Archon of the Hebdomad, who has spoken to
Moses, and says: “I am the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and I have not manifested
unto them the name of God”835 (for so they wish that it had been written)—that is, the God,
Arrhetus, Archon of the Ogdoad. All the prophets, therefore, who were before the Saviour
uttered their predictions, he says, from this source (of inspiration). Since, therefore, it was
requisite, he says, that we should be revealed as the children of God, in expectation of whose
manifestation, he says, the creation habitually groans and travails in pain, the Gospel came
into the world, and passed through every Principality, and Power, and Dominion, and every
Name that is named.836 And (the Gospel) came in reality, though nothing descended from
above; nor did the blessed Sonship retire from that Inconceivable, and Blessed, (and) Non-
Existent God. Nay, (far from it;) for as Indian naphtha, when lighted merely837 from a
considerably long distance, nevertheless attracts fire (towards it), so from below, from the
formlessness of the conglomeration (of all germs), the powers pass upwards as far as the

Sonship. For, according to the illustration of the Indian naphtha, the Son of the Great
Archon of the Ogdoad, as if he were some (sort of) naphtha, apprehends and seizes conceptions
from the Blessed Sonship, whose place of habitation is situated after that of the
Conterminous (Spirit). For the power of the Sonship which is in the midst of the Holy
Spirit, (that is,) in, the midst of the (Conterminous) Spirit, shares the flowing and rushing
thoughts of the Sonship with the Son of the Great Archon.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Whence Came the Gospel; The Number of Heavens According to
Basilides; Explanation of Christ’s Miraculous Conception.</head>
<p>The Gospel then came, says (Basilides), first from the Sonship through the Son, that
was seated beside the Archon, to the Archon, and the Archon learned that He was not God
of the universe, but was begotten. But (ascertaining that) He has above Himself the deposited
treasure of that Ineffable and Unnameable (and) Non-existent One, and of the Sonship, He
was both converted and filled with terror, when He was brought to understand in what ignorance
He was (involved). This, he says, is what has been declared: “The fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom.”838 For, being orally instructed by Christ, who was seated near,
he began to acquire wisdom, (inasmuch as he thereby) learns who is the Non-Existent One,
what the Sonship (is), what the Holy Spirit (is), what the apparatus of the universe (is), and
what is likely to be the consummation of things. This is the wisdom spoken in a mystery,
concerning which, says (Basilides), Scripture uses the following expressions: “Not in words
taught of human wisdom, but in (those) taught of the Spirit.”839 The Archon, then, being
orally instructed, and taught, and being (thereby) filled with fear, proceeded to make confession
concerning the sin which He had committed in magnifying Himself. This, he says,
is what is declared: “I have recognised my sin, and I know my transgression, (and) about
this I shall confess for ever.”840 When, then, the Great Archon had been orally instructed,
and every creature of the Ogdoad had been orally instructed and taught, and (after) the
mystery became known to the celestial (powers), it was also necessary that afterwards the
Gospel should come to the Hebdomad, in order likewise that the Archon of the Hebdomad
might be similarly instructed and indoctrinated into the Gospel. The Son of the Great
Archon (therefore) kindled in the Son of the Archon of the Hebdomad the light which
Himself possessed and had kindled from above from the Sonship. And the Son of the
Archon of the Hebdomad had radiance imparted to Him, and He proclaimed the Gospel
to the Archon of the Hebdomad. And in like manner, according to the previous account,
He Himself was both terrified and induced to make confession. When, therefore, all (beings)
in the Hebdomad had been likewise enlightened, and had the Gospel announced to them
(for in these regions of the universe there exist, according to these heretics, creatures infinite
(in number), viz., Principalities and Powers and Rulers, in regard of which there is extant
among the (Basilidians)841 a very prolix and verbose treatise, where they allege that there

are three hundred and sixty-five heavens, and that the great Archon of these is Abrasax,842
from the fact that his name comprises the computed number 365, so that, of course, the
calculation of the title includes all (existing) things, and that for these reasons the year
consists of so many days);—but when, he says, these (two events, viz., the illumination of
the Hebdomad and the manifestation of the Gospel) had thus taken place, it was necessary,
likewise, that afterwards the Formlessness existent in our quarter of creation should have
radiance imparted to it, and that the mystery should be revealed to the Sonship, which had
been left behind in Formlessness, just like an abortion.</p>
<p>Now this (mystery) was not made known to previous generations, as he says, it has been
written, “By revelation was made known unto me the mystery;”843 and, “I have heard inex
pressible words which it is not possible for man to declare.”844 The light, (therefore,) which
came down from the Ogdoad above to the Son of the Hebdomad, descended from the
Hebdomad upon Jesus the son of Mary, and he had radiance imparted to him by being illuminated
with the light that shone upon him. This, he says, is that which has been declared:
“The Holy Spirit will come upon thee,”845 (meaning) that which proceeded from the Sonship
through the conterminous spirit upon the Ogdoad and Hebdomad, as far as Mary; “and the
power of the Highest will overshadow thee,” (meaning) the power of the anointing,846
(which streamed) from the (celestial) height above (through) the Demiurge, as far as the
creation, which is (as far as) the Son. And as far as that (Son) he says the world consisted
thus. And as far as this, the entire Sonship, which is left behind for benefiting the souls in
Formlessness, and for being the recipient in turn of benefits,—(this Sonship, I say,) when
it is transformed, followed Jesus, and hastened upwards, and came forth purified. And it
becomes most refined, so that it could, as the first (Sonship), hasten upwards through its
own instrumentality. For it possesses all the power that, according to nature, is firmly
connected with the light which from above shone down (upon earth).</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—God’s Dealings with the Creature; Basilides’ Notion of (1) the Inner
Man, (2) the Gospel; His Interpretation of the Life and Sufferings of Our Lord.</head>
<p>When, therefore, he says, the entire Sonship shall have come, and shall be above the
conterminous spirit, then the creature will become the object of mercy. For (the creature)
groans until now,847 and is tormented, and waits for the manifestation of the sons of God,
in order that all who are men of the Sonship may ascend from thence. When this takes place,
God, he says, will bring upon the whole world enormous ignorance, that all things may
continue according to nature, and that nothing may inordinately desire anything of the
things that are contrary to nature. But (far from it); for all the souls of this quarter of creation,
as many as possess the nature of remaining immortal in this (region) only, continue (in it),
aware of nothing superior or better (than their present state). And there will not prevail any
rumour or knowledge in regions below, concerning beings whose dwelling is placed above,
lest subjacent souls should be wrung with torture from longing after impossibilities. (It
would be) just as if a fish were to crave to feed on the mountains along with sheep. (For) a
wish of this description would, he says, be their destruction. All things, therefore, that abide
in (this) quarter848 are incorruptible, but corruptible if they are disposed to wander and
cross over from the things that are according to nature. In this way the Archon of the Hebdomad
will know nothing of superjacent entities. For enormous ignorance will lay hold on
this one likewise, in order that sorrow, and grief, and groaning may depart from him; for
he will not desire aught of impossible things, nor will he be visited with anguish. In like
manner, however, the same ignorance will lay hold also on the Great Archon of the Ogdoad,
and similarly on all the creatures that are subject unto him, in order that in no respect anything
may desire aught of those things that are contrary to nature, and may not (thus) be
overwhelmed with sorrow. And so there will be the restitution of all things which, in conformity
with nature, have from the beginning a foundation in the seed of the universe, but
will be restored at (their own) proper periods. And that each thing, says (Basilides), has its
own particular times, the Saviour is a sufficient (witness849) when He observes, “Mine hour
is not yet come.”850 And the Magi (afford similar testimony) when they gaze wistfully upon
the (Saviour’s) star.851 For (Jesus) Himself was, he says, mentally preconceived at the time
of the generation of the stars, and of the complete return to their starting-point of the seasons
in the vast conglomeration (of all germs). This is, according to these (Basilidians), he who
has been conceived as the inner spiritual man in what is natural (now this is the Sonship

which left there the soul, not (that it might be) mortal, but that it might abide here according
to nature, just as the first Sonship left above in its proper locality the Holy Spirit, (that is,
the spirit) which is conterminous),—(this, I say, is he who has been conceived as the inner
spiritual man, and) has then been arrayed in his own peculiar soul.</p>
<p>In order, however, that we may not omit any of the doctrines of this (Basilides), I shall
likewise explain whatever statements they put forward respecting a gospel. For gospel with
them, as has been elucidated, is of super-mundane entities the knowledge which the Great
Archon did not understand. As, then, it was manifested unto him that there are likewise
the Holy Spirit—that is, the conterminous (spirit)—and the Sonship, and the Non-Existent
God, the cause of all these, he rejoiced at the communications made to him, and was filled
with exultation. According to them, this constitutes the gospel. Jesus, however, was born,
according to these (heretics), as we have already declared. And when the generation which
has been previously explained took place, all the events in our Lord’s life occurred, according
to them, in the same manner as they have been described in the Gospels. And these things
happened, he says, in order that Jesus might become the first-fruits of a distinction of the
different orders (of created objects) that had been confused together.852 For when the world
had been divided into an Ogdoad, which is the head of the entire world,—now the great
Archon is head of the entire world,—and into a Hebdomad,—which is the head of the
Hebdomad, the Demiurge of subjacent entities,—and into this order of creatures (that prevails)
amongst us, where exists Formlessness, it was requisite that the various orders of
created objects that had been confounded together should be distinguished by a separating
process performed by Jesus. (Now this separation) that which was his corporeal part suffered,
and this was (the part) of Formlessness and reverted into Formlessness. And that was resuscitated
which was his psychical part, and this was (part) of the Hebdomad, and reverted
into the Hebdomad. And he revived that (element in his nature) which was the peculiar
property of the elevated region where dwells the Great Archon, and (that element) remained
beside the Great Archon. And he carried upwards as far as (that which is) above that which
was (the peculiar property) of the conterminous spirit, and he remained in the conterminous
spirit. And through him there was purified the third Sonship, which had been left for conferring
benefits, and receiving them. And (through Jesus) it ascended towards the blessed
Sonship, and passed through all these. For the entire purpose of these was the blending together
of, as it were, the conglomeration of all germs, and the distinction of the various orders
of created objects, and the restoration into their proper component parts of things that had
been blended together. Jesus, therefore, became the first-fruits of the distinction of the
various orders of created objects, and his Passion took place for not any other reason than
the distinction which was thereby brought about in the various orders of created objects

that had been confounded together. For in this manner (Basilides) says that the entire Sonship,
which had been left in Formlessness for the purpose of conferring benefits and receiving
them, was divided into its component elements, according to the manner in which also the
distinction of natures had taken place in Jesus. These, then, are the legends which likewise
Basilides details after his sojourn in Egypt;853 and being instructed by the (sages of this
country) in so great a system of wisdom, (the heretic) produced fruits of this description.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—The System of Saturnilus.</head>
<p>But one Saturnilus,854 who flourished about the same period with Basilides,855 but spent
his time in Antioch, (a city) of Syria, propounded opinions akin to whatever (tenets) Menander
(advanced). He asserts that there is one Father, unknown to all—He who had made
angels, archangels, principalities, (and) powers; and that by certain angels, seven (in number),
the world was made, and all things that are in it. And (Saturnilus affirms) that man was a
work of angels. There had appeared above from (the Being of) absolute sway, a brilliant856
image; and when (the angels) were not able to detain this, on account of its immediately,
he says, returning with rapidity upwards, they exhorted one another, saying, “Let us make
man in our likeness and image.”857 And when the figure was formed, and was not, he says,
able, owing to the impotence of the angels, to lift up itself, but continued writhing as a worm,
the Power above, compassionating him on account of his having been born in its own image,
sent forth a scintillation of life, which raised man up, and caused him to have vitality. (Saturnilus)
asserts that this scintillation of life rapidly returns after death to those things that
are of the same order of existence; and that the rest, from which they have been generated,
are resolved into those. And the Saviour858 he supposed to be unbegotten and incorporeal,
and devoid of figure. (Saturnilus,) however, (maintained that Jesus) was manifested as man
in appearance only. And he says that the God of the Jews is one of the angels, and, on account
of the Father’s wishing to deprive of sovereignty all the Archons, that Christ came for the
overthrow of the God of the Jews, and for the salvation of those that believe upon Him; and
that these have in them the scintillation of life. For he asserted that two kinds of men had
been formed by the angels,—one wicked, but the other good. And, since demons from time
to time assisted wicked (men, Saturnilus affirms) that the Saviour came for the overthrow
of worthless men and demons, but for the salvation of good men. And he affirms that marriage
and procreation are from Satan. The majority, however, of those who belong to this
(heretic’s school) abstain from animal food likewise, (and) by this affectation of asceticism
(make many their dupes). And (they maintain) that the prophecies have been uttered, partly
by the world-making angels, and partly by Satan, who is also the very angel whom they

<head>Chapter XVII.—Marcion; His Dualism; Derives His System from Empedocles; Sketch
of the Doctrine of Empedocles.</head>
<p>But Marcion,860 a native of Pontus, far more frantic than these (heretics), omitting the
majority of the tenets of the greater number (of speculators), (and) advancing into a doctrine
still more unabashed, supposed (the existence of) two originating causes of the universe,
alleging one of them to be a certain good (principle), but the other an evil one. And himself
imagining that he was introducing some novel (opinion), founded a school full of folly, and
attended by men of a sensual mode of life, inasmuch as he himself was one of lustful
propensities.861 This (heretic) having thought that the multitude would forget that he did
not happen to be a disciple of Christ, but of Empedocles,862 who was far anterior to himself,
framed and formed the same opinions,—namely, that there are two causes of the universe,
discord and friendship. For what does Empedocles say respecting the plan of the world?
Even though we have previously spoken (on this subject), yet even now also, for the purpose,
at all events, of comparing the heresy of this plagiarist (with its source), we shall not be silent.</p>
<p>This (philosopher) affirms that all the elements out of which the world consists and
derives its being, are six: two of them material, (viz.,) earth and water; and two of them instruments
by which material objects are arranged and altered, (viz.,) fire and air; and two
of them, by means of the instruments, operating upon matter and fashioning it, viz., discord
and friendship. (Empedocles) expresses himself somehow thus:—
<lg>
<l>“The four roots of all things hear thou first:</l>
<l>Brilliant Jove, and life-giving Juno and Aidoneus,</l>
<l>And Nestis, who with tears bedews the mortal font.”863</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Jupiter is fire, and life-giving Juno earth, which produces fruits for the support of existence;
and Aidoneus air, because although through him we behold all things, yet himself
alone we do not see. But Nestis is water, for this is a sole vehicle of (food), and thus becomes
a cause of sustenance to all those that are being nourished; (but) this of itself is not able to
afford nutriment to those that are being nourished. For if it did possess the power of affording
nutriment, animal life, he says, could never be destroyed by famine, inasmuch as water is
always superabundant in the world. For this reason he denominates Nestis water, because,

<pb n="287"/>
(though indirectly) being a cause of nutriment, it is not (of itself) competent to afford nutriment
to those things that are being nourished. These, therefore—to delineate them as by
way of outline—are the principles that comprise (Empedocles’) entire theory of the world:
(viz.,) water and earth, out of which (proceed) generated entities; fire and spirit, (which are)
instruments and efficient (causes), but discord and friendship, which are (principles)
artistically fabricating (the universe). And friendship is a certain peace, and unanimity, and
love, whose entire effort is, that there should be one finished and complete world. Discord,
however, invariably separates that one (world), and subdivides it, or makes many things
out of one. Therefore discord is of the entire creation a cause which he styles “oulomenon,”
that is, destructive. For it is the concern of this (discord), that throughout every age the
creation itself should continue to preserve its existing condition. And ruinous discord has
been (thus) a fabricator and an efficient cause of the production of all generated entities;
whereas friendship (is the cause) of the eduction, and alteration, and restoration of existing
things into one system. And in regard of these (causes), Empedocles asserts that they are
two immortal and unbegotten principles, and such as have not as yet received an originating
cause of existence. (Empedocles) somewhere or other (expresses himself) in the following
manner:—
<lg>
<l>“For if both once it was, and will be; never, I think,</l>
<l>Will be the age eternal void of both of these.”864</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>(But) what are these (two)? Discord and Friendship; for they did not begin to come into
being, but pre-existed and always will exist, because, from the fact of their being unbegotten,
they are not able to undergo corruption. But fire, (and water,) and earth, and air, are (entities)
that perish and revive. For when these generated (bodies), by reason of Discord, cease to
exist, Friendship, laying hold on them, brings them forward, and attaches and associates
them herself with the universe. (And this takes place) in order that the Universe may continue
one, being always ordered by Friendship in a manner one and the same, and with
(uninterrupted) uniformity.</p>
<p>When, however, Friendship makes unity out of plurality, and associates with unity
separated entities, Discord, again, forcibly severs them from unity, and makes them many,
that is, fire, water, earth, air, (as well as) the animals and plants produced from these, and
whatever portions of the world we observe. And in regard of the form of the world, what
sort it is, (as) arranged by Friendship, (Empedocles) expresses himself in the following
terms:—
<lg>
<l>“For not from back two arms arise,</l>
<l>Not feet, not nimble knees, not genital groin,</l>
</lg>
<note type="footnote">864 These are lines 110, 111, in Stein’s edition of Empedocles.</note>

<pb n="288"/>
<lg>
<l>But a globe it was, and equal to itself it is.”865</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>An operation of this description Friendship maintains, and makes (one) most beautiful
form of the world out of plurality. Discord, however, the cause of the arrangement of each
of the parts (of the universe), forcibly severs and makes many things out of that one (form).
And this is what Empedocles affirms respecting his own generation:—
<lg>
<l>“Of these I also am from God a wandering exile.”866</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>That is, (Empedocles) denominates as God the unity and unification of that (one form)
in which (the world) existed antecedent to the separation and production (introduced) by
Discord among the majority of those things (that subsisted) in accordance with the disposition
(effected) by Discord. For Empedocles affirms Discord to be a furious, and perturbed,
and unstable Demiurge, (thus) denominating Discord the creator of the world. For this
constitutes the condemnation and necessity of souls which Discord forcibly severs from
unity, and (which it) fashions and operates upon, (according to Empedocles,) who expresses
himself after some such mode as, the following:—
<lg>
<l>“Who perjury piles on sin,</l>
<l>While demons gain a life prolonged;”867</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>meaning by demons long-lived souls, because they are immortal, and live for lengthened
ages:—
<lg>
<l>“For thrice ten thousand years banished from bliss;”868</l>

<p>For souls “change,” body after body being altered, and punished by Discord, and not
permitted to continue in the one (frame), but that the souls are involved in all descriptions
of punishment by Discord being changed from body to body. He says:—
<lg>
<l>“Æthereal force to ocean drives the souls,</l>
<l>And ocean spurts them forth on earth’s expanse,</l>
<l>And earth on beams of blazing sun, who flings</l>
<l>(The souls) on æther’s depths, and each from each</l>
<l>(A spirit) takes, and all with hatred burn.”870</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>This is the punishment which the Demiurge inflicts, just as some brazier moulding (a
piece of) iron, and dipping it successively from fire into water. For fire is the æther whence
the Demiurge transfers the souls into the sea; and land is the earth: whence he uses the
words, from water into earth, and from earth into air. This is what (Empedocles) says:
<lg>
<l>“And earth on beams</l>
<l>Of blazing sun, who flings (the souls)</l>
<l>On æther’s depths, and each from each</l>
<l>A (spirit) takes, and all with hatred burn.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>The souls, then, thus detested, and tormented, and punished in this world, are, according
to Empedocles, collected by Friendship as being a certain good (power), and (one) that pities
the groaning of these, and the disorderly and wicked device of furious Discord. And (likewise
Friendship is) eager, and toils to lead forth little by little the souls from the world, and to
domesticate them with unity, in order that all things, being conducted by herself, may attain
unto unification. Therefore on account of such an arrangement on the part of destructive
Discord of this divided world, Empedocles admonishes his disciples to abstain from all sorts
of animal food. For he asserts that the bodies of animals are such as feed on the habitations
of punished souls. And he teaches those who are hearers of such doctrines (as his), to refrain
from intercourse with women. (And he issues this precept) in order that (his disciples) may
not co-operate with and assist those works which Discord fabricates, always dissolving and
forcibly severing the work of Friendship. Empedocles asserts that this is the greatest law of
the management of the universe, expressing himself somehow thus:—
<lg>
<l>“There’s something swayed by Fate, the ancient,</l>
<l>Endless law of gods, and sealed by potent oaths.”871</l>

<pb n="290"/>
<p>He thus calls Fate the alteration from unity into plurality, according to Discord, and
from plurality into unity, according to Friendship. And, as I stated, (Empedocles asserts)
that there are four perishable gods, (viz.,) fire, water, earth, (and) air. (He maintains,) however,
that there are two (gods) which are immortal, unbegotten, (and) continually hostile
one to the other, (namely) Discord and Friendship. And (he asserts) that Discord always is
guilty of injustice and covetousness, and forcible abduction of the things of Friendship, and
of appropriation of them to itself. (He alleges,) however, that Friendship, inasmuch as it is
always and invariably a certain good (power), and intent on union, recalls and brings towards
(itself), and reduces to unity, the parts of the universe that have been forcibly severed, and
tormented, and punished in the creation by the Demiurge. Some such system of philosophy
as the foregoing is advanced for us by Empedocles concerning the generation of the world,
and its destruction, and its constitution, as one consisting of what is good and bad. And he
says that there is likewise a certain third power which is cognised by intellect, and that this
can be understood from these, (viz., Discord and Friendship,) expressing himself somehow
thus:—
<lg>
<l>“For if, ’neath hearts of oak, these truths you fix,</l>
<l>And view them kindly in meditations pure,</l>
<l>Each one of these, in lapse of time, will haunt you,</l>
<l>And many others, sprung of these, descend.</l>
<l>For into every habit these will grow, as Nature prompts;</l>
<l>But if for other things you sigh, which, countless, linger</l>
<l>Undisguised ’mid men, and blunt the edge of care,</l>
<l>As years roll on they’ll leave you fleetly,</l>
<l>Since they yearn to reach their own beloved race;</l>
<l>For know that all possess perception and a share of mind.”872</l>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Source of Marcionism; Empedocles Reasserted as the Suggester of
the Heresy.</head>
<p>When, therefore, Marcion or some one of his hounds barks against the Demiurge, and
adduces reasons from a comparison of what is good and bad, we ought to say to them, that
neither Paul the apostle nor Mark, he of the maimed finger,873 announced such (tenets).
For none of these (doctrines) has been written in the Gospel according to Mark. But (the
real author of the system) is Empedocles, son of Meto, a native of Agrigentum. And (Marcion)
despoiled this (philosopher), and imagined that up to the present would pass undetected
his transference, under the same expressions, of the arrangement of his entire heresy from
Sicily into the evangelical narratives. For bear with me, O Marcion: as you have instituted
a comparison of what is good and evil, I also to-day will institute a comparison following
up your own tenets, as you suppose them to be. You affirm that the Demiurge of the world
is evil—why not hide your countenance in shame, (as thus) teaching to the Church the
doctrines of Empedocles? You say that there is a good Deity who destroys the works of the
Demiurge: then do not you plainly preach to your pupils, as the good Deity, the Friendship
of Empedocles. You forbid marriage, the procreation of children, (and) the abstaining from
meats which God has created for participation by the faithful, and those that know the
truth.874 (Thinkest thou, then,) that thou canst escape detection, (while thus) enjoining the
purificatory rites of Empedocles? For in point of fact you follow in every respect this
(philosopher of paganism), while you instruct your own disciples to refuse meats, in order
not to eat any body (that might be) a remnant of a soul which has been punished by the
Demiurge. You dissolve marriages that have been cemented by the Deity. And here again
you conform to the tenets of Empedocles, in order that for you the work of Friendship may
be perpetuated as one (and) indivisible. For, according to Empedocles, matrimony separates
unity, and makes (out of it) plurality, as we have proved.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—The Heresy of Prepon; Follows Empedocles; Marcion Rejects the
Generation of the Saviour.</head>
<p>The principal heresy of Marcion, and (the one of his) which is most free from admixture
(with other heresies), is that which has its system formed out of the theory concerning the
good and bad (God). Now this, it has been manifested by us, belongs to Empedocles. But
since at present, in our times, a certain follower of Marcion, (namely) Prepon, an Assyrian,875
has endeavoured to introduce something more novel, and has given an account of his heresy
in a work inscribed to Bardesanes, an Armenian, neither of this will I be silent. In alleging
that what is just constitutes a third principle, and that it is placed intermediate between what
is good and bad, Prepon of course is not able to avoid (the imputation of inculcating) the
opinion of Empedocles. For Empedocles asserts that the world is managed by wicked Discord,
and that the other (world) which (is managed) by Friendship, is cognisable by intellect.
And (he asserts) that these are the two different principles of good and evil, and that intermediate
between these diverse principles is impartial reason, in accordance with which are
united the things that have been separated by Discord, (and which,) in accordance with the
influence of Friendship, are accommodated to unity. The impartial reason itself, that which
is an auxiliary to Friendship, Empedocles denominates “Musa.” And he himself likewise
entreats her to assist him, and expresses himself somehow thus:—
<lg>
<l>“For if on fleeting mortals, deathless Muse,</l>
<l>Thy care it be that thoughts our mind engross,</l>
<l>Calliope, again befriend my present prayer,</l>
<l>As I disclose a pure account of happy gods.”876</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Marcion, adopting these sentiments, rejected altogether the generation of our Saviour.
He considered it to be absurd that under the (category of a) creature fashioned by destructive
Discord should have been the Logos that was an auxiliary to Friendship—that is, the Good
Deity. (His doctrine,) however, was that, independent of birth, (the Logos) Himself descended
from above in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, and that, as being intermediate
between the good and bad Deity, He proceeded to give instruction in the synagogues.
For if He877 is a Mediator, He has been, he says, liberated from the entire nature of the Evil
Deity. Now, as he affirms, the Demiurge is evil, and his works. For this reason, he affirms,
Jesus came down unbegotten, in order that He might be liberated from all (admixture of)

evil. And He has, he says, been liberated from the nature of the Good One likewise, in order
that He may be a Mediator, as Paul states,878 and as Himself acknowledges: “Why call ye
me good? there is one good.”879 These, then, are the opinions of Marcion, by means of
which he made many his dupes, employing the conclusions of Empedocles. And he transferred
the philosophy invented by that (ancient speculator) into his own system of thought,
and (out of Empedocles) constructed his (own) impious heresy. But I consider that this has
been sufficiently refuted by us, and that I have not omitted any opinion of those who purloin
their opinions from the Greeks, and act despitefully towards the disciples of Christ, as if
they had become teachers to them of these (tenets). But since it seems that we have sufficiently
explained the doctrines of this (heretic), let us see what Carpocrates says.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—The Heresy of Carpocrates; Wicked Doctrines Concerning Jesus
Christ; Practise Magical Arts; Adopt a Metempsychosis.</head>
<p>Carpocrates880 affirms that the world and the things in it were made by angels, far inferior
to the unbegotten Father; and that Jesus was generated of Joseph, and that, having
been born similar to (other) men, He was more just than the rest (of the human race). And
(Carpocrates asserts) that the soul (of Jesus), inasmuch as it was made vigorous and undefiled,
remembered the things seen by it in its converse with the unbegotten God. And (Carpocrates
maintains) that on this account there was sent down upon (Jesus) by that (God) a power,
in order that through it He might be enabled to escape the world-making (angels). And (he
says) that this power, having passed through all, and having obtained liberty in all, again
ascended881 to God (Himself). And (he alleges) that in the same condition with (the soul
of Jesus are all the souls) that embrace similar objects of desire with the (power just alluded
to). And they assert that the soul of Jesus, (though,) according to law, it was disciplined in
Jewish customs, (in reality) despised them. And (he says) that on this account (Jesus) received
powers whereby He rendered null and void the passions incidental to men for their punishment.
And (he argues), therefore, that the (soul), which, similarly with that soul of Christ,
is able to despise the world-making Archons, receives in like manner power for the performance
of similar acts. Wherefore, also, (according to Carpocrates, there are persons who)
have attained unto such a degree of pride as to affirm some of themselves to be equal to Jesus
Himself, whereas others among them to be even still more powerful. But (they also contend)
that some enjoy an excellence above the disciples of that (Redeemer), for instance Peter and
Paul, and the rest of the Apostles, and that these are in no respect inferior to Jesus. And
(Carpocrates asserts) that the souls of these have originated from that supernal power, and
that consequently they, as equally despising the world-making (angels), have been deemed
worthy of the same power, and (of the privilege) to ascend to the same (place). If, however,
any one would despise earthly concerns more than did that (Saviour, Carpocrates says) that
such a one would be able to become superior to (Jesus. The followers of this heretic) practise
their magical arts and incantations, and spells and voluptuous feasts. And (they are in the
habit of invoking the aid of) subordinate demons and dream-senders, and (of resorting to)
the rest of the tricks (of sorcery), alleging that they possess power for now acquiring sway
over the Archons and makers of this world, nay, even over all the works that are in it.</p>

<p>(Now these heretics) have themselves been sent forth by Satan, for the purpose of
slandering before the Gentiles the divine name of the Church. (And the devil’s object is,)
that men hearing, now after one fashion and now after another, the doctrines of those
(heretics), and thinking that all of us are people of the same stamp, may turn away their ears
from the preaching of the truth, or that they also, looking, (without abjuring,) upon all the
tenets of those (heretics), may speak hurtfully of us. (The followers of Carpocrates) allege
that the souls are transferred from body to body, so far as that they may fill up (the measure
of) all their sins. When, however, not one (of these sins) is left, (the Carpocratians affirm
that the soul) is then emancipated, and departs unto that God above of the world-making
angels, and that in this way all souls will be saved. If, however, some (souls), during the
presence of the soul in the body for one life, may by anticipation become involved in the
full measure of transgressions, they, (according to these heretics,) no longer undergo metempsychosis.
(Souls of this sort,) however, on paying off at once all trespasses, will, (the
Carpocratians say,) be emancipated from dwelling any more in a body. Certain, likewise,
of these (heretics) brand882 their own disciples in the back parts of the lobe of the right ear.
And they make counterfeit images of Christ, alleging that these were in existence at the time

<p>But a certain Cerinthus,884 himself being disciplined in the teaching of the Egyptians,
asserted that the world was not made by the primal Deity, but by some virtue which was an
offshoot from that Power which is above all things, and which (yet) is ignorant of the God
that is above all. And he supposed that Jesus was not generated from a virgin, but that he
was born son of Joseph and Mary, just in a manner similar with the rest of men, and that
(Jesus) was more just and more wise (than all the human race). And (Cerinthus alleges)
that, after the baptism (of our Lord), Christ in form of a dove came down upon him, from
that absolute sovereignty which is above all things. And then, (according to this heretic,)
Jesus proceeded to preach the unknown Father,885 and in attestation (of his mission) to
work miracles. It was, however, (the opinion of Cerinthus,) that ultimately Christ departed
from Jesus, and that Jesus suffered and rose again; whereas that Christ, being spiritual,886
remained beyond the possibility of suffering.</p>

Carpocrates. They live conformably to the customs of the Jews, alleging that they are justified
according to the law, and saying that Jesus was justified by fulfilling the law. And therefore
it was, (according to the Ebionæans,) that (the Saviour) was named (the) Christ of God and
Jesus,888 since not one of the rest (of mankind) had observed completely the law. For if even
any other had fulfilled the commandments (contained) in the law, he would have been that

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The Heresy of Theodotus.</head>
<p>But there was a certain Theodotus,889 a native of Byzantium, who introduced a novel
heresy. He announces tenets concerning the originating cause of the universe, which are
partly in keeping with the doctrines of the true Church, in so far as he acknowledges that
all things were created by God. Forcibly appropriating, however, (his notions of) Christ
from the school of the Gnostics, and of Cerinthus and Ebion, he alleges that (our Lord) appeared
in some such manner as I shall now describe. (According to this, Theodotus maintains)
that Jesus was a (mere) man, born of a virgin, according to the counsel of the Father,
and that after he had lived promiscuously with all men, and had become pre-eminently religious,
he subsequently at his baptism in Jordan received Christ, who came from above and
descended (upon him) in form of a dove. And this was the reason, (according to Theodotus,)
why (miraculous) powers did not operate within him prior to the manifestation in him of
that Spirit which descended, (and) which proclaims him to be the Christ. But (among the
followers of Theodotus) some are disposed (to think) that never was this man made God,
(even) at the descent of the Spirit; whereas others (maintain that he was made God) after
the resurrection from the dead.</p>

<p>While, however, different questions have arisen among them, a certain (heretic), who
himself also was styled Theodotus, and who was by trade a banker,890 attempted to establish
(the doctrine), that a certain Melchisedec constitutes the greatest power, and that this one
is greater than Christ. And they allege that Christ happens to be according to the likeness
(of this Melchisedec). And they themselves, similarly with those who have been previously
spoken of as adherents of Theodotus, assert that Jesus is a (mere) man, and that, in conformity
with the same account (already given), Christ descended upon him.</p>
<p>There are, however, among the Gnostics diversities of opinion; but we have decided
that it would not be worth while to enumerate the silly doctrines of these (heretics), inasmuch
as they are (too) numerous and devoid of reason, and full of blasphemy. Now, even those
(of the heretics) who are of a more serious turn in regard of891 the Divinity, and have derived
their systems of speculation from the Greeks, must stand convicted892 (of these charges).
But Nicolaus893 has been a cause of the wide-spread combination of these wicked men. He,
as one of the seven (that were chosen) for the diaconate,894 was appointed by the Apostles.
(But Nicolaus) departed from correct doctrine, and was in the habit of inculcating indifferency
of both life and food.895 And when the disciples (of Nicolaus) continued to offer insult
to the Holy Spirit, John reproved them in the Apocalypse as fornicators and eaters of things
offered unto idols.896</p>

evils. But these he denominates angels. He utters, however, slanders against law and
prophets, by alleging that the things that have been written are (of) human (origin), and are
false. And (Apelles) selects from the Gospels or (from the writings of) the Apostle (Paul)
whatever pleases himself. But he devotes himself to the discourses of a certain Philumene
as to the revelations902 of a prophetess. He affirms, however, that Christ descended from
the power above; that is, from the good (Deity), and that he is the son of that good (Deity).
And (he asserts that Jesus) was not born of a virgin, and that when he did appear he was
not devoid of flesh. (He maintains,) however, that (Christ) formed his body by taking portions
of it from the substance of the universe: that is, hot and cold, and moist and dry. And
(he says that Christ), on receiving in this body cosmical powers, lived for the time he did in
(this) world. But (he held that Jesus) was subsequently crucified by the Jews, and expired,
and that, being raised up after three days, he appeared to his disciples. And (the Saviour)
showed them, (so Apelles taught,) the prints of the nails and (the wound) in his side, desirous
of persuading them that he was in truth no phantom, but was present in the flesh. After,
says (Apelles), he had shown them his flesh, (the Saviour) restored it to earth, from which
substance it was (derived. And this he did because) he coveted nothing that belonged to
another. (Though indeed Jesus) might use for the time being (what belonged to another),
he yet in due course rendered to each (of the elements) what peculiarly belonged to them.
And so it was, that after he had once more loosed the chains of his body, he gave back heat
to what is hot, cold to what is cold, moisture to what is moist, (and) dryness to what is dry.
And in this condition (our Lord) departed to the good Father, leaving the seed of life in the
world for those who through his disciples should believe in him.</p>
<p>It appears to us that these (tenets) have been sufficiently explained. Since, however, we
have determined to leave unrefuted not one of those opinions that have been advanced by
any (of the heretics), let us see what (system) also has been invented by the Docetæ.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Heresies Hitherto Refuted; Opinions of the Docetæ.</head>
<p>Since the great body of (the heretics) do not employ the counsel of the Lord, by having
the beam in the eye,906 and announce that they see when in reality labouring under blindness,
it seems to us expedient in no wise to be silent concerning the tenets of these. Our object is,
that by the refutation accomplished by us, the (heretics), being of themselves ashamed, may
be brought to know how the Saviour has advised (men) first to take away the beam, then to
behold clearly the mote that is in thy brother’s eye. Having therefore adequately and sufficiently
explained the doctrines of the majority (of the heretics) in the seven books before
this, we shall not now be silent as regards the (heterodox) opinions that follow (from these).
We shall by this means exhibit the abundance of the grace of the Holy Spirit; and we shall
refute those (who suppose) that they have acquired stedfastness of doctrine, when it is only
in appearance. Now these have styled themselves Docetæ,907 and propound the following
opinions:—</p>
<p>(The Docetæ maintain) that God is the primal (Being), as it were a seed of a fig-tree,
which is altogether very diminutive in size, but infinite in power. (This seed constitutes,
according to the Docetæ,) a lowly magnitude, incalculable in multitude,908 (and) labouring
under no deficiency as regards generation. (This seed is) a refuge for the terror-stricken, a
shelter of the naked, a veil for modesty, (and) the sought-for produce, to which He came in
search (for fruit), he says, three times,909 and did not discover (any). Wherefore, he says,
He cursed the fig-tree,910 because He did not find upon it that sweet fruit—the sought-for
produce. And inasmuch as the Deity is, according to them—to express myself briefly—of
this description and so great, that is, small and minute, the world, as it seems to them, was
made in some such manner as the following: When the branches of the fig-tree became
tender, leaves budded (first), as one may (generally) see, and next in succession the fruit.

founder of the Docetic heresy.</note>
<note type="footnote">908 Miller’s text reads ταπεινὸν (lowly), but this is obviously untenable. Duncker alters it into ἄπειρον (infinite),
and joins ταπεινὸν with the word following. He renders the passage thus: “but infinite in power—a lowly magnitude.”
Cruice strikes out the word ταπεινὸν , and renders the passage thus: “but infinite in power, a magnitude
incalculable in bulk.” The above rendering seems to convey Hippolytus’ meaning.</note>

<pb n="304"/>
Now, in this (fruit) is preserved treasured the infinite and incalculable seed of the fig-tree.
We think, therefore, (say the Docetæ,) that there are three (parts) which are primarily produced
by the seed of the fig-tree, (viz.,) stem, which constitutes the fig-tree, leaves, and
fruit—the fig itself, as we have previously declared. In this manner, the (Docetic) affirms,
have been produced three Æons, which are principles from the primal originating cause of
the universe. And Moses has not been silent on this point, when he says, that there are three
words of God, “darkness, gloom, tempest, and added no more.”911 For the (Docetic) says,
God has made no addition to the three Æons; but these, in every respect, have been sufficient
for (the exigencies of) those who have been begotten and are sufficient. God Himself, however,
remains with Himself, far separated from the three Æons. When each of these Æons
had obtained an originating cause of generation, he grew, as has been declared, by little and
little, and (by degrees) was magnified, and (ultimately) became perfect. But they think that
that is perfect which is reckoned at ten. When, therefore, the Æons had become equal in
number and in perfection, they were, as (the Docetæ) are of opinion, constituted thirty
Æons in all, while each of them attains full perfection in a decade. And the three are mutually
distinct, and hold one (degree of) honour relatively to one another, differing in position
merely, because one of them is first, and the other second, and the other of these third.
Position, however, afforded them diversity of power. For he who has obtained a position
nearest to the primal Deity—who is, as it were, a seed—possessed a more productive power
than the rest, inasmuch as he himself who is the immeasurable one, measured himself tenfold
in bulk. He, however, who in position is second to the primal Deity, has, inasmuch as he is
the incomprehensible one, comprehended himself sixfold. But he who is now third in position
is conveyed to an infinite distance, in consequence of the dilatation of his brethren. (And
when this third Æon) had thrice realized himself in thought, he encircled himself with, as
it were, some eternal chain of union.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Docetic Notion of the Incarnation; Their Doctrines of Æons; Their
Account of Creation; Their Notion of a Fiery God.</head>
<p>And these (heretics) suppose that this is what is spoken by the Saviour: “A sower went
forth to sow; and that which fell on the fair and good ground produced, some a hundredfold,
and some sixty-fold, and some thirty-fold.”912 And for this reason, the (Docetic) says,
(that the Saviour) has spoken the words, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,” because
these (truths)are not altogether rumours. All these Æons, both the three and all those infinite
(Æons which proceed) from these indefinitely, are hermaphrodite Æons. All these, then,
after they had been increased and magnified, and had sprung from that one primary seed,
(were actuated by a spirit) of concord and union, and they all coalesced into one Æon. And
in this manner they begot of a single virgin, Mary,913 a joint offspring, who is a Mediator,
(that is,) the Saviour of all who are in the (covenant of) mediation. (And this Saviour is,) in
every respect, coequal in power with the seed of the fig-tree, with the exception that he was
generated. Whereas that primary seed, from whence the fig-tree sprung, is unbegotten.
When, therefore, those three Æons were adorned with all virtue and with all sanctity, so
these teachers suppose, as well as that only begotten child—for he alone was begotten by
those infinite Æons from three immediately concerned in his birth, for three immeasurable
Æons being unanimous procreated him;—(after, I say, the Æons and only Son were thus
adorned,) the entire nature, which is cognised by intellect, was fashioned free from deficiency.
Now, all those intelligible and eternal (entities) constituted light. Light, however, was not
devoid of form, nor inoperative, nor in want, as it were, of the assistance of any (other
power). But (light) proportionately with the multitude of those infinite (Æons) indefinitely
(generated) in conformity with the exemplar of the fig-tree, possesses in itself infinite species
of various animals indigenous to that quarter of creation, and it shone down upon the underlying
chaos. And when this (chaos) was simultaneously illuminated, and had form imparted
to it by those diversified species from above, it derived (thereby) solidity, and acquired
all those supernal species from the third Æon, who had made himself threefold.</p>
<p>This third Æon, however, beholding all his own distinctive attributes laid hold on collectively
by the underlying darkness (which was) beneath, and not being ignorant of the
power of darkness, and at the same time of the security914 and profusion of light, did not
allow his brilliant attributes (which he derived) from above for any length of time to be
snatched away by the darkness beneath. But (he acted in quite a contrary manner), for he

subjected (darkness) to the Æons. After, then, he had formed the firmament over the nether
world, “he both divided the darkness from the light, and called the light which was above
the firmament day, and the darkness he called night.”915 When all the infinite species, then,
as I have said, of the third Æon were intercepted in this the lowest darkness, the figure also
of the Æon himself, such as he has been described, was impressed (upon them) along with
the rest (of his attributes). (Now this figure is) a life-giving fire, which is generated from
light, from whence the Great Archon originated. And respecting this (Archon) Moses observes:
“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”916 Moses mentions917
this fiery God as having spoken from the bush,918 (batos,) that is, from the darkish air. For
the whole of the atmosphere that underlies the darkness is (batos, i.e.,) a medium for the
transmission of light. Now Moses has employed, says (the Docetic), the expression batos,
because all the species of light pass down from above by means of their having the atmosphere
as a medium (batos) of transmission. And in no less degree is capable of being recognised
the Word of Jehovah addressed to us from the bush (batos, i.e., an atmospheric medium);
for voice, as significant (in language) of a meaning, is a reverberation of air, and without
this (atmosphere) human speech is incapable of being recognised. And not only the Word
(of Jehovah addressed) to us from the bush (batos), that is, the air, legislates and is a fellowcitizen
with (us); but (it does more than this), for both odours and colours manifest to us,
through the medium of air, their own (peculiar) qualities.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Christ Undoes the Work of the Demiurge; Docetic Account of the
Baptism and Death of Jesus; Why He Lived for Thirty Years on Earth.</head>
<p>This fiery deity, then, after he became fire from light, proceeded to create the world in
the manner which Moses describes. He himself, however, as devoid of subsistence, employs
the darkness as (his) substance, and perpetually insults those eternal attributes of light which,
(being) from above, had been laid hold on by (the darkness) beneath. Up to the time,
therefore, of the appearance of the Saviour, there prevailed, by reason of the Deity of fiery
light, (that is,) the Demiurge, a certain extensive delusion of souls. For the species are styled
souls, because they are refrigerations919 from the (Æons) above, and continue in darkness.
But when (the souls) are altered from bodies to bodies, they remain under the guardianship
of the Demiurge. And that these things are so, says (the Docetic), it is possible also to perceive
from Job, when he uses the following words: “And I am a wanderer, changing both place
after place, and house after house.”920 And (we may learn, according to the Docetæ, the
same) from the expressions of the Saviour, “And if ye will receive it, this is Elias that was
for to come. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”921 But by the instrumentality of the
Saviour this transference of souls from body to body was made to cease, and faith is preached
for remission of sins. After some such manner, that only begotten Son, when He gazes upon
the forms of the supernal Æons, which were transferred from above into darkish bodies,
coming down, wished to descend and deliver them. When (the Son), however, became aware
that the Æons, those (that subsist) collectively, are unable to behold the Pleroma of all the
Æons, but that in a state of consternation they fear lest they may undergo corruption as
being themselves perishable, and that they are overwhelmed by the magnitude and splendour
of power;—(when the Son, I say, perceived this,) He contracted Himself—as it were a very
great flash in a very small body, nay, rather as a ray of vision condensed beneath the eyelids,
and (in this condition) He advances forth as far as heaven and the effulgent stars. And in
this quarter of creation He again collects himself beneath the lids of vision according as He
wishes it. Now the light of vision accomplishes the same effect; for though it is everywhere,
and (renders visible) all things, it is yet imperceptible to us. We, however, merely see lids
of vision, while corners (of the eye), a tissue which is broad, tortuous,922 (and) exceedingly
fibrous, a membrane of the cornea; and underneath this, the pupil, which is shaped as a

berry, is net-like and round. (And we observe) whatever other membranes there are that
belong to the light of the eye, and enveloped in which it lies concealed.</p>
<p>Thus, says (the Docetic), the only-begotten (and) eternal Child from above arrayed
Himself in a form to correspond with each individual Æon of the three Æons;923 and while
he was within the triacontad of Æons, He entered into this world924 just as we have described
Him, unnoticed, unknown, obscure, and disbelieved. In order, therefore, say the Docetæ,
that He may be clad in the darkness that is prevalent in more distant quarters of creation—(
now by darkness he means) flesh—an angel journeyed with Him from above, and
announced the glad tidings to Mary, says (the Docetic), as it has been written. And the
(child) from her was born, as it has been written. And He who came from above put on that
which was born; and so did He all things, as it has been written (of Him) in the Gospels. He
washed in Jordan, and when He was baptized He received a figure and a seal in the water
of (another spiritual body beside) the body born of the Virgin. (And the object of this was,)
when the Archon condemned his own peculiar figment (of flesh) to death, (that is,) to the
cross, that that soul which had been nourished in the body (born of the Virgin) might strip
off that body and nail it to the (accursed) tree. (In this way the soul) would triumph by
means of this (body) over principalities and powers,925 and would not be found naked, but
would, instead of that flesh, assume the (other) body, which had been represented in the
water when he was being baptized. This is, says (the Docetic), what the Saviour affirms:
“Except a man be born of water and spirit, he will not enter into the kingdom of heaven,
because that which is born of the flesh is flesh.”926 From the thirty Æons, therefore, (the
Son) assumed thirty forms. And for this reason that eternal One existed for thirty years on
the earth, because each Æon was in a peculiar manner manifested during (his own) year.
And the souls are all those forms that have been laid hold on by each of the thirty Æons;
and each of these is so constituted as to discern Jesus, who is of a nature (similar to their
own). (And it was the nature of this Jesus) which that only-begotten and eternal One assumed
from everlasting places. These (places), however, are diverse. Consequently, a proportionate
number of heresies, with the utmost emulation, seek Jesus. Now all these heresies have their
own peculiar Jesus; but he is seen differently according as the place927 is different towards
which, he says, each soul is borne and hastens. (Now each soul) supposes that (the Jesus
seen from its particular place) is alone that (Jesus) who is its own peculiar kinsman and

below, are not able to see the forms of the Saviour which are above them. Those, however,
he says, who are from above, from the intermediate decade and the most excellent ogdoad—
whence, say (the Docetæ), we are—have themselves known not in part, but entirely,

<p>These (statements), therefore, I consider sufficient to properly-constituted minds for
the purpose of attaining unto a knowledge of the complicated and unstable heresy of the
Docetæ. (But) those who have propounded attempted arguments about inaccessible and
incomprehensible Matter, have styled themselves Docetæ. Now, we consider that some of

proved that a beam from such matter is carried in the eye, if by any means they may be enabled
to perceive it. If, however, they do not (discern it, our object is) that they should not
make others blind. But the fact is, that the sophists of the Greeks in ancient times have previously
devised, in many particulars, the doctrines of these (Docetæ), as it is possible for my
readers (who take the trouble) to ascertain. These, then, are the opinions propounded by
the Docetæ. As to what likewise, however, are the tenets of Monoïmus, we shall not be silent.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Monoïmus; Man the Universe, According to Monoïmus; His System
of the Monad.</head>
<p>Monoïmus928 the Arabian was far removed from the glory of the high-sounding poet.
(For Monoïmus) supposes that there is some such man as the poet (calls) Oceanus, expressing
himself somehow thus:—
<lg>
<l>“Oceans, source of gods and source of men.”929</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Changing these (sentiments) into other words, Monoïmus says that man is the universe.
Now the universe is the originating cause of all things, unbegotten, incorruptible, (and)
eternal. And (he says) that the son of (the) man previously spoken of is begotten, and subject
to passion, (and) that he is generated independently of time, (as well as) undesignedly,930
(and) without being predestinated. For such, he says, is the power of that man. And he being
thus constituted in power, (Monoïmus alleges) that the son was born quicker than thought
and volition. And this, he says, is what has been spoken in the Scriptures, “He was, and was
generated.”931 And the meaning of this is: Man was, and his son was generated; just as one
may say, Fire was, and, independently of time, and undesignedly, and without being predestinated,
light was generated simultaneously with the existence of the fire. And this man
constitutes a single monad, which is uncompounded and indivisible, (and yet at the same
time) compounded (and) divisible. (And this monad is) in all respects friendly (and) in all
respects peaceful, in all respects quarrelsome (and) in all respects contentious with itself,
dissimilar (and) similar. (This monad is likewise,) as it were, a certain musical harmony,
which comprises all things in itself, as many as one may express and may omit when not
considering; and it manifests all things, and generates all things. This (is) Mother, this (is)
Father—two immortal names. As an illustration, however, consider, he says, as a greatest
image of the perfect man, the one jot—that one tittle. And this one tittle is an uncompounded,
simple, and pure monad, which derives its composition from nothing at all. (And yet this
tittle is likewise) compounded, multiform, branching into many sections, and consisting of
many parts. That one indivisible tittle is, he says, one tittle of the (letter) iota, with many
faces, and innumerable eyes, and countless names, and this (tittle) is an image of that perfect
invisible man.</p>
<note type="footnote">928 What is given here by Hippolytus respecting Monoïmus is quite new. The only writer that mentions him

<head>Chapter VI.—Monoïmus’ “Iota;” His Notion of the “Son of Man.”</head>
<p>The monad, (that is,) the one tittle, is932 therefore, he says, also a decade. For by the
actual power of this one tittle, are produced duad, and triad, and tetrad, and pentad, and
hexad, and heptad, and ogdoad, and ennead, up to ten. For these numbers, he says, are
capable of many divisions, and they reside in that simple and uncompounded single tittle
of the iota. And this is what has been declared: “It pleased (God) that all fulness should
dwell in the Son of man bodily.”933 For such compositions of numbers out of the simple
and uncompounded one tittle of the iota become, he says, corporeal realities. The Son of
man, therefore, he says, has been generated from the perfect man, whom no one knew; every
creature who is ignorant of the Son, however, forms an idea of Him as the offspring of a
woman. And certain very obscure rays of this Son which approach this world, check and
control alteration (and) generation. And the beauty of that Son of man is up to the present
incomprehensible to all men, as many as are deceived in reference to the offspring of the
woman. Therefore nothing, he says, of the things that are in our quarter of creation has
been produced by that man, nor will aught (of these) ever be (generated from him). All
things, however, have been produced, not from the entirety, but from some part of that Son
of man. For he says the Son of man is a jot in one tittle, which proceeds from above, is full,
and completely replenishes all (rays flowing down from above). And it comprises in itself
whatever things the man also possesses (who is) the Father of the Son of man.</p>

and pyramids, and all figures similar to these, out of which consist fire, air, water,
(and) earth, have arisen from numbers which are comprehended in that simple tittle of the
iota. And this (tittle) constitutes a perfect son of a perfect man. When, therefore, he says,
Moses mentions that the rod was changeably brandished for the (introduction of the) plagues
throughout Egypt934—now these plagues, he says, are allegorically expressed symbols of
the creation935—he did not (as a symbol) for more plagues than ten shape the rod. Now
this (rod) constitutes one tittle of the iota, and is (both) twofold (and) various. This succession
of ten plagues is, he says, the mundane creation. For all things, by being stricken, bring forth
and bear fruit, just like vines. Man, he says, bursts forth, and is forcibly separated from man
by being severed by a certain stroke. (And this takes place) in order that (man) may be
generated, and may declare the law which Moses ordained, who received (it) from God.
Conformably936 with that one tittle, the law constitutes the series of the ten commandments
which expresses allegorically the divine mysteries of (those) precepts. For, he says, all
knowledge of the universe is contained in what relates to the succession of the ten plagues
and the series of the ten commandments. And no one is acquainted with this (knowledge)
who is (of the number) of those that are deceived concerning the offspring of the woman.
If, however, you say that the Pentateuch constitutes the entire law, it is from the Pentad
which is comprehended in the one tittle. But the entire is for those who have not been altogether
perfected in understanding a mystery, a new and not antiquated feast, legal, (and)
everlasting, a passover of the Lord God kept unto our generations, by those who are able to
discern (this mystery), at the commencement of the fourteenth day, which is the beginning
of a decade from which, he says, they reckon. For the monad, as far as fourteen, is the
summary of that one (tittle) of the perfect number. For one, two, three, four, become ten;
and this is the one tittle. But from fourteen until one-and-twenty, he asserts that there is an
Hebdomad which inheres in the one tittle of the world, and constitutes an unleavened
creature in all these. For in what respect, he says, would the one tittle require any substance

such as leaven (derived) from without for the Lord’s Passover, the eternal feast, which is
given for generation upon generation?937 For the entire world and all causes of creation
constitute a passover, (i.e.,) a feast of the Lord. For God rejoices in the conversion of the
creation, and this is accomplished by ten strokes of the one tittle. And this (tittle) is Moses’
rod, which was given by God into the hand of Moses. And with this (rod Moses) smites the
Egyptians, for the purpose of altering bodies,—as, for instance, water into blood; and the
rest of (material) things similarly with these,—(as, for example,) the locusts, which is a
symbol of grass. And by this he means the alteration of the elements into flesh; “for all flesh,”
he says, “is grass.”938 These men, nevertheless receive even the entire law after some such
manner; adopting very probably, as I think, the opinions of those of the Greeks who affirm
that there are Substance, and Quality, and Quantity, and Relation, and Place, and Time, and
Position, and Action, and Possession, and Passion.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Monoïmus Explains His Opinions in a Letter to Theophrastus;
Where to Find God; His System Derived from Pythagoras.</head>
<p>Monoïmus himself, accordingly, in his letter to Theophrastus, expressly makes the following
statement: “Omitting to seek after God, and creation, and things similar to these,
seek for Him from (out of) thyself, and learn who it is that absolutely appropriates (unto
Himself) all things in thee, and says, ‘My God (is) my mind, my understanding, my soul,
my body.’ And learn from whence are sorrow, and joy, and love, and hatred, and involuntary
wakefulness, and involuntary drowsiness, and involuntary anger, and involuntary affection;
and if,” he says, “you accurately investigate these (points), you will discover (God) Himself,
unity and plurality, in thyself, according to that tittle, and that He finds the outlet (for Deity)
to be from thyself.” Those (heretics), then, (have made) these (statements). But we are under
no necessity of comparing such (doctrines) with what have previously been subjects of
meditation on the part of the Greeks, inasmuch as the assertions advanced by these (heretics)
evidently derive their origin from geometrical and arithmetical art. The disciples, however,
of Pythagoras, expounded this (art) after a more excellent method,939 as our readers may
ascertain by consulting those passages (of our work) in which we have previously furnished
expositions of the entire wisdom of the Greeks. But since the heresy of Monoïmus has been
sufficiently refuted, let us see what are the fictitious doctrines which the rest also (of these
heretics) devise, in their desire to set up for themselves an empty name.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Hermogenes; Adopts the Socratic Philosophy; His Notion Concerning
the Birth and Body of Our Lord.</head>
<p>But a certain Hermogenes,941 himself also imagining that he propounded some novel
opinion, said that God made all things out of coeval and ungenerated matter. For that it
was impossible that God could make generated things out of things that are not. And that
God is always Lord, and always Creator, and matter always a subservient (substance), and
that which is assuming phases of being—not, however, the whole of it. For when it was being
continually moved in a rude and disorderly manner, He reduced (matter) into order by the
following expedient. As He gazed (upon matter) in a seething condition, like (the contents
of) a pot when a fire is burning underneath, He effected a partial separation. And taking
one portion from the whole, He subdued it, but another He allowed to be whirled in a disorderly
manner. And he asserts that what was (thus) subdued is the world, but that another
portion remains wild, and is denominated chaotic942 matter. He asserts that this constitutes
the substance of all things, as if introducing a novel tenet for his disciples. He does not,
however, reflect that this happens to be the Socratic discourse, which (indeed) is worked
out more elaborately by Plato than by Hermogenes. He acknowledges, however, that Christ
is the Son of the God who created all things; and along with (this admission), he confesses
that he was born of a virgin and of (the) Spirit, according to the voice of the Gospels. And
(Hermogenes maintains that Christ), after His passion, was raised up in a body, and that
He appeared to His disciples, and that as He went up into heaven He left His body in the
sun, but that He Himself proceeded on to the Father. Now (Hermogenes) resorts to testimony,
thinking to support himself by what is spoken, (viz.) what the Psalmist David says:
“In the sun he hath placed his tabernacle, and himself (is) as a bridegroom coming forth
from his nuptial chamber, (and) he will rejoice as a giant to run his course.”943 These, then,
are the opinions which also Hermogenes attempted to establish.</p>

<p>And certain other (heretics), contentious by nature, (and) wholly uninformed as regards
knowledge, as well as in their manner more (than usually) quarrelsome, combine (in
maintaining) that Easter should be kept on the fourteenth day944 of the first month, according
to the commandment of the law, on whatever day (of the week) it should occur. (But in this)
they only regard what has been written in the law, that he will be accursed who does not so
keep (the commandment) as it is enjoined. They do not, however, attend to this (fact), that
the legal enactment was made for Jews, who in times to come should kill the real Passover.945
And this (paschal sacrifice, in its efficacy,) has spread unto the Gentiles, and is discerned
by faith, and not now observed in letter (merely). They attend to this one commandment,
and do not look unto what has been spoken by the apostle: “For I testify to every man that
is circumcised, that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.”946 In other respects, however,
these consent to all the traditions delivered to the Church by the Apostles.947</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—The Montanists; Priscilla and Maximilla Their Prophetesses; Some
of Them Noetians.</head>
<p>But there are others who themselves are even more heretical in nature (than the foregoing),
and are Phrygians948 by birth. These have been rendered victims of error from being
previously captivated by (two) wretched women, called a certain Priscilla and Maximilla,
whom they supposed (to be) prophetesses. And they assert that into these the Paraclete
Spirit had departed; and antecedently to them, they in like manner consider Montanus as
a prophet. And being in possession of an infinite number of their books, (the Phrygians)
are overrun with delusion; and they do not judge whatever statements are made by them,
according to (the criterion of) reason; nor do they give heed unto those who are competent
to decide; but they are heedlessly swept onwards, by the reliance which they place on these
(impostors). And they allege that they have learned something more through these, than
from law, and prophets, and the Gospels. But they magnify these wretched women above
the Apostles and every gift of Grace, so that some of them presume to assert that there is in
them a something superior to Christ. These acknowledge God to be the Father of the universe,
and Creator of all things, similarly with the Church, and (receive) as many things as the
Gospel testifies concerning Christ. They introduce, however, the novelties of fasts,949 and
feasts, and meals of parched food, and repasts of radishes, alleging that they have been instructed
by women. And some of these assent to the heresy of the Noetians, and affirm that
the Father himself is the Son, and that this (one) came under generation, and suffering, and
death. Concerning these I shall again offer an explanation, after a more minute manner; for
the heresy of these has been an occasion of evils to many. We therefore are of opinion, that
the statements made concerning these (heretics) are sufficient, when we shall have briefly
proved to all that the majority of their books are silly, and their attempts (at reasoning)
weak, and worthy of no consideration. But it is not necessary for those who possess a sound
mind to pay attention (either to their volumes or their arguments).</p>
<note type="footnote">948 These heretics had several denominations: (1) Phrygians and Cataphrygians, from Phrygia; (2) Pepuzians,
from a village in Phrygia of this name; (3) Priscillianists; (4) Quintillists. See Eusebius, Hist. Ecclesiast., iv. 27,

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Doctrines of the Encratites.950</head>
<p>Others, however, styling themselves Encratites, acknowledge some things concerning
God and Christ in like manner with the Church. In respect, however, of their mode of life,
they pass their days inflated with pride. They suppose, that by meats they magnify themselves,
while abstaining from animal food, (and) being water-drinkers, and forbidding to marry,
and devoting themselves during the remainder of life to habits of asceticism. But persons
of this description are estimated Cynics rather than Christians, inasmuch as they do not
attend unto the words spoken against them through the Apostle Paul. Now he, predicting
the novelties that were to be hereafter introduced ineffectually by certain (heretics), made
a statement thus: “The Spirit speaketh expressly, In the latter times certain will depart from
sound doctrine, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, uttering falsehoods
in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, to
abstain from meats, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by the
faithful, and those who know the truth; because every creature of God is good, and nothing
to be rejected which is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God
and prayer.”951 This voice, then, of the blessed Paul, is sufficient for the refutation of those
who live in this manner, and plume themselves on being just;952 (and) for the purpose of
proving that also, this (tenet of the Encratites) constitutes a heresy. But even though there
have been denominated certain other heresies—I mean those of the Cainites,953 Ophites,954
or Noachites,955 and of others of this description—I have not deemed it requisite to explain
the things said or done by these, lest on this account they may consider themselves somebody,
or deserving of consideration. Since, however, the statements concerning these appear to
be sufficient, let us pass on to the cause of evils to all, (viz.,) the heresy of the Noetians. Now,

<head>Chapter II.—Source of the Heresy of Noetus; Cleomenes His Disciple; Its Appearance
at Rome During the Episcopates of Zephyrinus and Callistus; Noetianism Opposed
at Rome by Hippolytus.</head>
<p>There has appeared one, Noetus960 by name, and by birth a native of Smyrna. This
person introduced a heresy from the tenets of Heraclitus.961 Now a certain man called
Epigonus becomes his minister and pupil, and this person during his sojourn at Rome disseminated
his godless opinion. But Cleomenes, who had become his disciple, an alien both
in way of life and habits from the Church, was wont to corroborate the (Noetian) doctrine.
At that time, Zephyrinus imagines that he administers the affairs of the Church962—an
uninformed and shamefully corrupt man. And he, being persuaded by proffered gain, was
accustomed to connive at those who were present for the purpose of becoming disciples of
Cleomenes. But (Zephyrinus) himself, being in process of time enticed away, hurried
headlong963 into the same opinions; and he had Callistus as his adviser, and a fellowchampion
of these wicked tenets.964 But the life of this (Callistus), and the heresy invented
by him, I shall after a little explain. The school of these heretics during the succession of
such bishops, continued to acquire strength and augmentation, from the fact that Zephyrinus
and Callistus helped them to prevail.965 Never at any time, however, have we been guilty of
collusion with them; but we have frequently offered them opposition,966 and have refuted
them, and have forced them reluctantly to acknowledge the truth. And they, abashed and
constrained by the truth, have confessed their errors for a short period, but after a little,
wallow once again in the same mire.967</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Noetianism an Offshoot from the Heraclitic Philosophy.</head>
<p>But since we have exhibited the succession of their genealogy, it seems expedient next
that we should also explain the depraved teaching involved in their doctrines. For this purpose
we shall first adduce the opinions advanced by Heraclitus “the Obscure,”968 and we shall
next make manifest what are the portions of these opinions that are of Heraclitean origin.
Such parts of their system its present champions are not aware belong to the “Obscure”
philosopher, but they imagine969 them to belong to Christ. But if they might happen to fall
in with the following observations, perhaps they thus might be put out of countenance, and
induced to desist from this godless blasphemy of theirs. Now, even though the opinion of
Heraclitus has been expounded by us previously in the Philosophumena, it nevertheless
seems expedient now also to set down side by side in contrast the two systems, in order that
by this closer refutation they may be evidently instructed. I mean the followers of this
(heretic), who imagine970 themselves to be disciples of Christ, when in reality they are not
so, but of “the Obscure.”</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—An Account of the System of Heraclitus.</head>
<p>Heraclitus then says that the universe is one,971 divisible and indivisible; generated and
ungenerated; mortal and immortal; reason, eternity; Father, Son, and justice, God.972 “For
those who hearken not to me, but the doctrine, it is wise that they acknowledge all things
to be one,” says Heraclitus; and because all do not know or confess this, he utters a reproof
somewhat in the following terms: “People do not understand how what is diverse (nevertheless)
coincides with itself, just like the inverse harmony of a bow and lyre.”973 But that
Reason always exists, inasmuch as it constitutes the universe, and as it pervades all things,
he affirms in this manner. “But in regard of this Reason, which always exists, men are continually
devoid of understanding,974 both before they have heard of it and in first hearing
of it. For though all things take place according to this Reason, they seem like persons devoid
of any experience regarding it. Still they attempt both words and works of such a description
as I am giving an account of, by making a division according to nature, and declaring how
things are.” And that a Son is the universe and throughout endless ages an eternal king of
all things, he thus asserts: “A sporting child, playing at his dice, is eternity; the kingdom is
that of a child.”975 And that the Father of all things that have been generated is an unbegotten
creature who is creator, let us hear Heraclitus affirming in these words: “Contrariety is a
progenitor of all things, and king of all; and it exhibited some as gods, but others as men,
and made some slaves, whereas others free.” And (he likewise affirms) that there is “a harmony,
as in a bow and lyre.” That obscure harmony (is better),976 though unknown and
invisible to men, he asserts in these words: “An obscure harmony is preferable to an obvious
one.” He commends and admires before what is known, that which is unknown and invisible
in regard of its power. And that harmony visible to men, and not incapable of being dis-

things are one.”)</note>

Heraclitean philosophy is explained by Stobæus, already mentioned. See likewise Bernays’ “Critical Epistle” in

and intelligence, these I pre-eminently honour,” he says; that is, he prefers things visible to
those that are invisible. From such expressions of his it is easy to understand the spirit of
his philosophy. “Men,” he says, “are deceived in reference to the knowledge of manifest
things similarly with Homer, who was wiser than all the Greeks. For even children977 killing
vermin deceived him, when they said, ‘What we have seen and seized, these we leave behind;
whereas what we neither have seen nor seized, these we carry away.’”</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Heraclitus’ Estimate of Hesiod; Paradoxes of Heraclitus; His Eschatology;
The Heresy of Noetus of Heraclitean Origin; Noetus’ View of the Birth and
Passion of Our Lord.</head>
<p>In this manner Heraclitus assigns to the visible an equality of position and honour with
the invisible, as if what was visible and what was invisible were confessedly some one thing.
For he says, “An obscure harmony is preferable to an obvious one;” and, “Whatsoever things
are objects of vision, hearing, and intelligence,” that is, of the (corporeal) organs,—“these,”
he says, “I pre-eminently honour,” not (on this occasion, though previously), having preeminently
honoured invisible things. Therefore neither darkness, nor light, nor evil, nor
good, Heraclitus affirms, is different, but one and the same thing. At all events, he censures
Hesiod978 because he knew not day and night. For day, he says, and night are one, expressing
himself somehow thus: “The teacher, however, of a vast amount of information is Hesiod,
and people suppose this poet to be possessed of an exceedingly large store of knowledge,
and yet he did not know (the nature of) day and night, for they are one.” As regards both
what is good and what is bad, (they are, according to Heraclitus, likewise) one. “Physicians,
undoubtedly,” says Heraclitus, “when they make incisions and cauterize, though in every
respect they wickedly torture the sick, complain that they do not receive fitting remuneration
from their patients, notwithstanding that they perform these salutary operations upon diseases.”
And both straight and twisted are, he says, the same. “The way is straight and curved
of the carders of wool;”979 and the circular movement of an instrument in the fuller’s shop
called “a screw” is straight and curved, for it revolves up and circularly at the same time.
“One and the same,” he says, “are, therefore, straight and curved.” And upward and downward,
980 he says, are one and the same. “The way up and the way down are the same.” And
he says that what is filthy and what is pure are one and the same, and what is drinkable and
unfit for drink are one and the same. “Sea,” he says, “is water very pure and very foul,
drinkable to fishes no doubt, and salutary for them, but not fit to be used as drink by men,
and (for them) pernicious.” And, confessedly, he asserts that what is immortal is mortal,981
and that what is mortal is immortal, in the following expressions: “Immortals are mortal,

and mortals are immortal, that is, when the one derive life from death, and the other death
from life.” And he affirms also that there is a resurrection of this palpable flesh in which we
have been born; and he knows God to be the cause of this resurrection, expressing himself
in this manner: “Those that are here982 will God enable to arise and become guardians of
quick and dead.” And he likewise affirms that a judgment of the world and all things in it
takes place by fire, expressing himself thus: “Now, thunder pilots all things,” that is, directs
them, meaning by the thunder everlasting fire. But he also asserts that this fire is endued
with intelligence, and a cause of the management of the Universe, and he denominates it
craving and satiety. Now craving is, according to him, the arrangement of the world,
whereas satiety its destruction. “For,” says he, “the fire, coming upon the earth, will judge
and seize all things.”</p>
<p>But in this chapter Heraclitus simultaneously explains the entire peculiarity of his mode
of thinking, but at the same time the (characteristic quality) of the heresy of Noetus. And I
have briefly demonstrated Noetus to be not a disciple of Christ, but of Heraclitus. For this
philosopher asserts that the primal world is itself the Demiurge and creator of itself in the
following passage: “God is day, night; winter, summer; war, peace; surfeit, famine.” All
things are contraries—this appears his meaning—“but an alteration takes place, just as983
if incense were mixed with other sorts of incense, but denominated984 according to the
pleasurable sensation produced by each sort. Now it is evident to all that the silly successors
of Noetus, and the champions of his heresy, even though they have not been hearers of the
discourses of Heraclitus, nevertheless, at any rate when they adopt the opinions of Noetus,
undisguisedly acknowledge these (Heraclitean) tenets. For they advance statements after
this manner—that one and the same God is the Creator and Father of all things; and that
when it pleased Him, He nevertheless appeared, (though invisible,) to just men of old. For
when He is not seen He is invisible; and He is incomprehensible when He does not wish to
be comprehended, but comprehensible when he is comprehended. Wherefore it is that,
according to the same account, He is invincible and vincible, unbegotten and begotten,
immortal and mortal. How shall not persons holding this description of opinions be proved
to be disciples of Heraclitus? Did not (Heraclitus) the Obscure anticipate Noetus in framing
a system of philosophy, according to identical modes of expression?</p>

<pb n="330"/>
<p>Now, that Noetus affirms that the Son and Father are the same, no one is ignorant. But
he makes his statement thus: “When indeed, then, the Father had not been born, He yet was
justly styled Father; and when it pleased Him to undergo generation, having been begotten,
He Himself became His own Son, not another’s.” For in this manner he thinks to establish
the sovereignty of God, alleging that Father and Son, so called, are one and the same (substance),
not one individual produced from a different one, but Himself from Himself; and
that He is styled by name Father and Son, according to vicissitude of times.985 But that He
is one who has appeared (amongst us), both having submitted to generation from a virgin,
and as a man having held converse among men. And, on account of the birth that had taken
place, He confessed Himself to those beholding Him a Son, no doubt; yet He made no secret
to those who could comprehend Him of His being a Father. That this person suffered by
being fastened to the tree, and that He commended His spirit unto Himself, having died to
appearance, and not being (in reality) dead. And He raised Himself up the third day, after
having been interred in a sepulchre, and wounded with a spear, and perforated with nails.
Cleomenes asserts, in common with his band of followers, that this person is God and
Father of the universe, and thus introduces among many an obscurity (of thought) such as
we find in the philosophy of Heraclitus.</p>

<p>Callistus attempted to confirm this heresy,—a man cunning in wickedness, and subtle
where deceit was concerned, (and) who was impelled by restless ambition to mount the
episcopal throne.986 Now this man moulded to his purpose Zephyrinus, an ignorant and illiterate
individual, and one unskilled in ecclesiastical definitions.987 And inasmuch as
Zephyrinus was accessible to bribes, and covetous, Callistus, by luring him through presents,
and by illicit demands, was enabled to seduce him into whatever course of action he pleased.
And so it was that Callistus succeeded in inducing Zephyrinus to create continually disturbances
among the brethren, while he himself took care subsequently, by knavish words, to
attach both factions in good-will to himself. And, at one time, to those who entertained true
opinions, he would in private988 allege that they held similar doctrines (with himself), and
thus make them his dupes; while at another time he would act similarly towards those (who
embraced) the tenets of Sabellius. But Callistus perverted Sabellius himself, and this, too,
though he had the ability of rectifying this heretic’s error. For (at any time) during our admonition
Sabellius did not evince obduracy; but as long as he continued alone with Callistus,
he was wrought upon to relapse into the system of Cleomenes by this very Callistus, who
alleges that he entertains similar opinions to Cleomenes. Sabellius, however, did not then
perceive the knavery of Callistus; but he afterwards came to be aware of it, as I shall narrate
presently.</p>
<p>Now Callistus brought forward Zephyrinus himself, and induced him publicly to avow
the following sentiments: “I know that there is one God, Jesus Christ; nor except Him do I
know any other that is begotten and amenable to suffering.” And on another occasion, when
he would make the following statement: “The Father did not die, but the Son.” Zephyrinus
would in this way continue to keep up ceaseless disturbance among the people. And we,989
becoming aware of his sentiments, did not give place to him, but reproved and withstood
him for the truth’s sake. And he hurried headlong into folly, from the fact that all consented
to his hypocrisy—we,990 however, did not do so—and called us worshippers of two gods,

time with ourselves, in order that, by the exposure of the habits of a person of this description,
the heresy attempted to be established by him may be easily known, and may perchance be
regarded as silly, by those endued with intelligence. This Callistus became a “martyr” at the

<p>Callistus happened to be a domestic of one Carpophorus, a man of the faith belonging
to the household of Cæsar. To this Callistus, as being of the faith, Carpophorus committed
no inconsiderable amount of money, and directed him to bring in profitable returns from
the banking business. And he, receiving the money, tried (the experiment of) a bank in what
is called the Piscina Publica.993 And in process of time were entrusted to him not a few deposits
by widows and brethren, under the ostensive cause of lodging their money with Carpophorus.
Callistus, however, made away with all (the moneys committed to him), and
became involved in pecuniary difficulties. And after having practised such conduct as this,
there was not wanting one to tell Carpophorus, and the latter stated that he would require
an account from him. Callistus, perceiving these things, and suspecting danger from his
master, escaped away by stealth, directing his flight towards the sea. And finding a vessel in
Portus ready for a voyage, he went on board, intending to sail wherever she happened to be
bound for. But not even in this way could he avoid detection, for there was not wanting one
who conveyed to Carpophorus intelligence of what had taken place. But Carpophorus, in
accordance with the information he had received, at once repaired to the harbour (Portus),
and made an effort to hurry into the vessel after Callistus. The boat, however, was anchored
in the middle of the harbour; and as the ferryman was slow in his movements, Callistus,
who was in the ship, had time to descry his master at a distance. And knowing that himself
would be inevitably captured, he became reckless of life; and, considering his affairs to be
in a desperate condition, he proceeded to cast himself into the sea. But the sailors leaped
into boats and drew him out, unwilling to come, while those on shore were raising a loud
cry. And thus Callistus was handed over to his master, and brought to Rome, and his master
lodged him in the Pistrinum.994</p>
<p>But as time wore on, as happens to take place in such cases, brethren repaired to Carpophorus,
and entreated him that he would release the fugitive serf from punishment, on the

<pb n="334"/>
plea of their alleging that Callistus acknowledged himself to have money lying to his credit
with certain persons. But Carpophorus, as a devout man, said he was indifferent regarding
his own property, but that he felt a concern for the deposits; for many shed tears as they remarked
to him, that they had committed what they had entrusted to Callistus, under the
ostensive cause of lodging the money with himself.995 And Carpophorus yielded to their
persuasions, and gave directions for the liberation of Callistus. The latter, however, having
nothing to pay, and not being able again to abscond, from the fact of his being watched,
planned an artifice by which he hoped to meet death. Now, pretending that he was repairing
as it were to his creditors, he hurried on their Sabbath-day to the synagogue of the Jews,
who were congregated, and took his stand, and created a disturbance among them. They,
however, being disturbed by him, offered him insult, and inflicted blows upon him, and
dragged him before Fuscianus, who was prefect of the city. And (on being asked the cause
of such treatment), they replied in the following terms: “Romans have conceded to us996
the privilege of publicly reading those laws of ours that have been handed down from our
fathers. This person, however, by coming into (our place of worship), prevented (us so doing),
by creating a disturbance among us, alleging that he is a Christian.” And Fuscianus happens
at the time to be on the judgment-seat; and on intimating his indignation against Callistus,
on account of the statements made by the Jews, there was not wanting one to go and acquaint
Carpophorus concerning these transactions. And he, hastening to the judgment-seat of the
prefect, exclaimed, “I implore of you, my lord Fuscianus, believe not thou this fellow; for he
is not a Christian, but seeks occasion of death, having made away with a quantity of my
money, as I shall prove.” The Jews, however, supposing that this was a stratagem, as if Carpophorus
were seeking under this pretext to liberate Callistus, with the greater enmity
clamoured against him in presence of the prefect. Fuscianus, however, was swayed by these
Jews, and having scourged Callistus, he gave him to be sent to a mine in Sardinia.997</p>
<p>But after a time, there being in that place other martyrs, Marcia, a concubine of Commodus,
who was a God-loving female, and desirous of performing some good work, invited

into her presence998 the blessed Victor, who was at that time a bishop of the Church,999
and inquired of him what martyrs were in Sardinia. And he delivered to her the names of
all, but did not give the name of Callistus, knowing the villanous acts he had ventured upon.
Marcia,1000 obtaining her request from Commodus, hands the letter of emancipation to
Hyacinthus, a certain eunuch,1001 rather advanced in life. And he, on receiving it, sailed
away into Sardinia, and having delivered the letter to the person who at that time was governor
of the territory, he succeeded in having the martyrs released, with the exception of
Callistus. But Callistus himself, dropping on his knees, and weeping, entreated that he likewise
might obtain a release. Hyacinthus, therefore, overcome by the captive’s importunity, requests
the governor to grant a release, alleging that permission had been given to himself from
Marcia1002 (to liberate Callistus), and that he would make arrangements that there should
be no risk in this to him. Now (the governor) was persuaded, and liberated Callistus also.
And when the latter arrived at Rome, Victor was very much grieved at what had taken place;
but since he was a compassionate man, he took no action in the matter. Guarding, however,
against the reproach (uttered) by many,—for the attempts made by this Callistus were not
distant occurrences,—and because Carpophorus also still continued adverse, Victor sends
Callistus to take up his abode in Antium, having settled on him a certain monthly allowance
for food. And after Victor’s death, Zephyrinus, having had Callistus as a fellow-worker in
the management of his clergy, paid him respect to his own damage; and transferring this
person from Antium, appointed him over the cemetery.1003</p>
<p>And Callistus, who was in the habit of always associating with Zephyrinus, and, as I
have previously stated, of paying him hypocritical service, disclosed, by force of contrast,
Zephyrinus to be a person able neither to form a judgment of things said, nor discerning the
design of Callistus, who was accustomed to converse with Zephyrinus on topics which yielded
satisfaction to the latter. Thus, after the death of Zephyrinus, supposing that he had obtained
<note type="footnote">998 Marcia’s connection with the emperor would not seem very consistent with the Christian character which
Hippolytus gives her. Dr. Wordsworth supposes that Hippolytus speaks ironically in the case of Marcia, as well
as of Hyacinthus and Carpophorus. [I do not see the evidence of this. Poor Marcia, afterwards poisoned by the
wretch who degraded, was a heathen who under a little light was awakening to some sense of duty, like the woman
of Samaria, John iv. 19.]</note>

(the position) after which he so eagerly pursued, he excommunicated Sabellius, as not entertaining
orthodox opinions. He acted thus from apprehension of me, and imagining that he
could in this manner obliterate the charge against him among the churches, as if he did not
entertain strange opinions.1004 He was then an impostor and knave, and in process of time
hurried away many with him. And having even venom imbedded in his heart, and forming
no correct opinion on any subject,1005 and yet withal being ashamed to speak the truth, this
Callistus, not only on account of his publicly saying in the way of reproach to us, “Ye are
Ditheists,” but also on account of his being frequently accused by Sabellius, as one that had
transgressed his first faith, devised some such heresy as the following. Callistus alleges that
the Logos Himself is Son, and that Himself is Father; and that though denominated by a
different title, yet that in reality He is one indivisible spirit. And he maintains that the Father
is not one person and the Son another, but that they are one and the same; and that all things
are full of the Divine Spirit, both those above and those below. And he affirms that the
Spirit, which became incarnate in the virgin, is not different from the Father, but one and
the same. And he adds, that this is what has been declared by the Saviour: “Believest thou
not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?”1006 For that which is seen, which is man,
he considers to be the Son; whereas the Spirit, which was contained in the Son, to be the
Father. “For,” says (Callistus), “I will not profess belief in two Gods, Father and Son, but in
one. For the Father, who subsisted in the Son Himself, after He had taken unto Himself our
flesh, raised it to the nature of Deity, by bringing it into union with Himself, and made it
one; so that Father and Son must be styled one God, and that this Person being one, cannot
be two.” And in this way Callistus contends that the Father suffered along with the Son; for
he does not wish to assert that the Father suffered, and is one Person, being careful to avoid
blasphemy against the Father. (How careful he is!) senseless and knavish fellow, who improvises
blasphemies in every direction, only that he may not seem to speak in violation of the
truth, and is not abashed at being at one time betrayed into the tenet of Sabellius, whereas
at another into the doctrine of Theodotus.</p>
<p>The impostor Callistus, having ventured on such opinions, established a school of
theology in antagonism to the Church, adopting the foregoing system of instruction. And
he first invented the device of conniving with men in regard of their indulgence in sensual

pleasures, saying that all had their sins forgiven by himself.1007 For he who is in the habit
of attending the congregation of any one else, and is called a Christian, should he commit
any transgression; the sin, they say, is not reckoned unto him, provided only he hurries off
and attaches himself to the school of Callistus. And many persons were gratified with his
regulation, as being stricken in conscience, and at the same time having been rejected by
numerous sects; while also some of them, in accordance with our condemnatory sentence,
had been by us forcibly ejected from the Church.1008 Now such disciples as these passed over
to these followers of Callistus, and served to crowd his school. This one propounded the
opinion, that, if a bishop was guilty of any sin, if even a sin unto death,1009 he ought not to
be deposed. About the time of this man, bishops, priests, and deacons, who had been twice
married, and thrice married, began to be allowed to retain their place among the clergy. If
also, however, any one who is in holy orders should become married, Callistus permitted
such a one to continue in holy orders as if he had not sinned.1010 And in justification, he
alleges that what has been spoken by the Apostle has been declared in reference to this person:
“Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant?”1011 But he asserted that likewise the
parable of the tares is uttered in reference to this one: “Let the tares grow along with the
wheat;”1012 or, in other words, let those who in the Church are guilty of sin remain in it.
But also he affirmed that the ark of Noe was made for a symbol of the Church, in which
were both dogs, and wolves, and ravens, and all things clean and unclean; and so he alleges
that the case should stand in like manner with the Church. And as many parts of Scripture
bearing on this view of the subject as he could collect, he so interpreted.</p>
<p>And the hearers of Callistus being delighted with his tenets, continue with him, thus
mocking both themselves as well as many others, and crowds of these dupes stream together
into his school. Wherefore also his pupils are multiplied, and they plume themselves upon
the crowds (attending the school) for the sake of pleasures which Christ did not permit. But
in contempt of Him, they place restraint on the commission of no sin, alleging that they
pardon those who acquiesce (in Callistus’ opinions). For even also he permitted females, if
they were unwedded,1013 and burned with passion at an age at all events unbecoming, or

Whence women, reputed believers, began to resort to drugs1014 for producing sterility, and
to gird themselves round, so to expel what was being conceived on account of their not
wishing to have a child either by a slave or by any paltry fellow, for the sake of their family
and excessive wealth.1015 Behold, into how great impiety that lawless one has proceeded,
by inculcating adultery and murder at the same time! And withal, after such audacious acts,
they, lost to all shame, attempt to call themselves a Catholic Church!1016 And some, under
the supposition that they will attain prosperity, concur with them. During the episcopate of
this one, second baptism was for the first time presumptuously attempted by them. These,
then, (are the practices and opinions which) that most astonishing Callistus established,
whose school continues, preserving its customs and tradition, not discerning with whom
they ought to communicate, but indiscriminately offering communion to all. And from him
they have derived the denomination of their cognomen; so that, on account of Callistus being
a foremost champion of such practices, they should be called Callistians.1017</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Sect of the Elchasaites; Hippolytus’ Opposition to It.</head>
<p>The doctrine of this Callistus having been noised abroad throughout the entire world,
a cunning man, and full of desperation, one called Alcibiades, dwelling in Apamea, a city
of Syria, examined carefully into this business. And considering himself a more formidable
character, and more ingenious in such tricks, than Callistus, he repaired to Rome; and he
brought some book, alleging that a certain just man, Elchasai,1018 had received this from
Seræ, a town of Parthia, and that he gave it to one called Sobiaï. And the contents of this
volume, he alleged, had been revealed by an angel whose height was 24 schoenoi, which make
96 miles, and whose breadth is 4 schoenoi, and from shoulder to shoulder 6 schoenoi; and
the tracks of his feet extend to the length of three and a half schoenoi, which are equal to
fourteen miles, while the breadth is one schoenos and a half, and the height half a schoenos.
And he alleges that also there is a female with him, whose measurement, he says, is according
to the standards already mentioned. And he asserts that the male (angel) is Son of God, but
that the female is called Holy Spirit. By detailing these prodigies he imagines that he confounds
fools, while at the same time he utters the following sentence: “that there was preached
unto men a new remission of sins in the third year of Trajan’s reign.” And Elchasai determines
the nature of baptism, and even this I shall explain. He alleges, as to those who have been
involved in every description of lasciviousness, and filthiness, and in acts of wickedness, if
only any of them be a believer, that he determines that such a one, on being converted, and
obeying the book, and believing its contents, should by baptism receive remission of sins.</p>
<p>Elchasai, however, ventured to continue these knaveries, taking occasion from the
aforesaid tenet of which Callistus stood forward as a champion. For, perceiving that many
were delighted at this sort of promise, he considered that he could opportunely make the
attempt just alluded to. And notwithstanding we offered resistance to this, and did not
permit many for any length of time to become victims of the delusion.1019 For we carried
conviction to the people, when we affirmed that this was the operation of a spurious spirit,
and the invention of a heart inflated with pride, and that this one like a wolf had risen up
against many wandering sheep, which Callistus, by his arts of deception, had scattered
abroad. But since we have commenced, we shall not be silent as regards the opinions of this
man. And, in the first place, we shall expose his life, and we shall prove that his supposed
discipline is a mere pretence. And next, I shall adduce the principal heads of his assertions,
in order that the reader, looking fixedly on the treatises of this (Elchasai), may be made
aware what and what sort is the heresy which has been audaciously attempted by this man.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Elchasai Derived His System from Pythagoras; Practised Incantations.</head>
<p>This Elchasai puts forward as a decoy a polity (authorized in the) Law, alleging that
believers ought to be circumcised and live according to the Law, (while at the same time)
he forcibly rends certain fragments from the aforesaid heresies. And he asserts that Christ
was born a man in the same way as common to all, and that Christ was not for the first time
on earth when born of a virgin, but that both previously and that frequently again He had
been born and would be born. Christ would thus appear and exist among us from time to
time, undergoing alterations of birth, and having his soul transferred from body to body.
Now Elchasai adopted that tenet of Pythagoras to which I have already alluded. But the
Elchasaites have reached such an altitude of pride, that even they affirm themselves to be
endued with a power of foretelling futurity, using as a starting-point, obviously, the measures
and numbers of the aforesaid Pythagorean art. These also devote themselves to the tenets
of mathematicians, and astrologers, and magicians, as if they were true. And they resort to
these, so as to confuse silly people, thus led to suppose that the heretics participate in a doctrine
of power. And they teach certain incantations and formularies for those who have been
bitten by dogs, and possessed of demons, and seized with other diseases; and we shall not
be silent respecting even such practices of these heretics. Having then sufficiently explained
their principles, and the causes of their presumptuous attempts, I shall pass on to give an
account of their writings, through which my readers will become acquainted with both the
trifling and godless efforts of these Elchasaites.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
<pb n="341"/>
<head>Chapter X.—Elchasai’s Mode of Administering Baptism; Formularies.</head>
<p>To those, then, that have been orally instructed by him, he dispenses baptism in this
manner, addressing to his dupes some such words as the following: “If, therefore, (my)
children,1020 one shall have intercourse with any sort of animal whatsoever, or a male, or
a sister, or a daughter, or hath committed adultery, or been guilty of fornication, and is desirous
of obtaining remission of sins, from the moment that he hearkens to this book let
him be baptized a second time in the name of the Great and Most High God, and in the
name of His Son, the Mighty King. And by baptism let him be purified and cleansed, and
let him adjure for himself those seven witnesses that have been described in this book—the
heaven, and the water, and the holy spirits, and the angels of prayer,1021 and the oil, and
the salt, and the earth.” These constitute the astonishing mysteries of Elchasai, those ineffable
and potent secrets which he delivers to deserving disciples. And with these that lawless one
is not satisfied, but in the presence of two and three witnesses he puts the seal to his own
wicked practices. Again expressing himself thus: “Again I say, O adulterers and adulteresses,
and false prophets, if you are desirous of being converted, that your sins may be forgiven
you, as soon as ever you hearken unto this book, and be baptized a second time along with
your garments, shall peace be yours, and your portion with the just.” But since we have
stated that these resort to incantations for those bitten by dogs and for other mishaps, we
shall explain these. Now Elchasai uses the following formulary: “If a dog rabid and furious,
in which inheres a spirit of destruction, bite any man, or woman, or youth, or girl, or may
worry or touch them, in the same hour let such a one run with all their wearing apparel, and
go down to a river or to a fountain wherever there is a deep spot. Let (him or her) be dipped
with all their wearing apparel, and offer supplication to the Great and Most High God in
faith of heart, and then let him thus adjure the seven witnesses described in this book: ‘Behold,
I call to witness the heaven and the water, and the holy spirits, and the angels of prayer, and
the oil, and the salt, and the earth. I testify by these seven witnesses that no more shall I sin,
nor commit adultery, nor steal, nor be guilty of injustice, nor be covetous, nor be actuated
by hatred, nor be scornful, nor shall I take pleasure in any wicked deeds.’ Having uttered,
therefore, these words, let such a one be baptized with the entire of his wearing apparel in
the name of the Mighty and Most High God.”</p>

<p>But in very many other respects he talks folly, inculcating the use of these sentences also
for those afflicted with consumption, and that they should be dipped in cold water forty
times during seven days; and he prescribes similar treatment for those possessed of devils.
Oh inimitable wisdom and incantations gorged with powers!1022 Who will not be astonished
at such and such force of words? But since we have stated that they also bring into requisition
astrological deceit, we shall prove this from their own formularies; for Elchasai speaks thus:
“There exist wicked stars of impiety. This declaration has been now made by us, O ye pious
ones and disciples: beware of the power of the days of the sovereignty of these stars, and
engage not in the commencement of any undertaking during the ruling days of these. And
baptize not man or woman during the days of the power of these stars, when the moon,
(emerging) from among them, courses the sky, and travels along with them. Beware of the
very day up to that on which the moon passes out from these stars, and then baptize and
enter on every beginning of your works. But, moreover, honour the day of the Sabbath,
since that day is one of those during which prevails (the power) of these stars. Take care,
however, not to commence your works the third day from a Sabbath, since when three years
of the reign of the emperor Trojan are again completed from the time that he subjected the
Parthians to his own sway,—when, I say, three years have been completed, war rages between
the impious angels of the northern constellations; and on this account all kingdoms of impiety
are in a state of confusion.”</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—The Heresy of the Elchasaites a Derivative One.</head>
<p>Inasmuch as (Elchasai) considers, then, that it would be an insult to reason that these
mighty and ineffable mysteries should be trampled under foot, or that they should be committed
to many, he advises that as valuable pearls1023 they should be preserved, expressing
himself thus: “Do not recite this account to all men, and guard carefully these precepts, because
all men are not faithful, nor are all women straightforward.” Books containing these
(tenets), however, neither the wise men of the Egyptians secreted in shrines, nor did Pythagoras,
a sage of the Greeks, conceal them there. For if at that time Elchasai had happened
to live, what necessity would there be that Pythagoras, or Thales, or Solon, or the wise Plato,
or even the rest of the sages of the Greeks, should become disciples of the Egyptian priests,
when they could obtain possession of such and such wisdom from Alcibiades, as the most
astonishing interpreter of that wretched Elchasai? The statements, therefore, that have been
made for the purpose of attaining a knowledge of the madness of these, would seem sufficient
for those endued with sound mind. And so it is, that it has not appeared expedient to quote
more of their formularies, seeing that these are very numerous and ridiculous. Since, however,
we have not omitted those practices that have risen up in our own day, and have not been
silent as regards those prevalent before our time, it seems proper, in order that we may pass
through all their systems, and leave nothing untold, to state what also are the (customs) of
the Jews, and what are the diversities of opinion among them, for I imagine that these as
yet remain behind for our consideration. Now, when I have broken silence on these points,
I shall pass on to the demonstration of the Doctrine of the Truth, in order that, after the
lengthened argumentative struggle against all heresies, we, devoutly pressing forward towards
the kingdom’s crown, and believing the truth, may not be unsettled.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Jewish Sects.</head>
<p>Originally there prevailed but one usage1024 among the Jews; for one teacher was given
unto them by God, namely Moses, and one law by this same Moses. And there was one desert
region and one Mount Sinai, for one God it was who legislated for these Jews. But, again,
after they had crossed the river Jordan, and had inherited by lot the conquered country,
they in various ways rent in sunder the law of God, each devising a different interpretation
of the declarations made by God. And in this way they raised up for themselves teachers,
(and) invented doctrines of an heretical nature, and they continued to advance into (sectarian)
divisions. Now it is the diversity of these Jews that I at present propose to explain. But though
for even a considerable time they have been rent into very numerous sects, yet I intend to
elucidate the more principal of them, while those who are of a studious turn will easily become
acquainted with the rest. For there is a division amongst them into three sorts;1025
and the adherents of the first are the Pharisees, but of the second the Sadducees, while the
rest are Essenes. These practise a more devotional life, being filled with mutual love, and
being temperate. And they turn away from every act of inordinate desire, being averse even
to hearing of things of the sort. And they renounce matrimony, but they take the boys of
others, and thus have an offspring begotten for them. And they lead these adopted children
into an observance of their own peculiar customs, and in this way bring them up and impel
them to learn the sciences. They do not, however, forbid them to marry, though themselves
refraining from matrimony. Women, however, even though they may be disposed to adhere
to the same course of life,1026 they do not admit, inasmuch as in no way whatsoever have
they confidence in women.</p>

writer of the first century, who derived his materials from the Jewish historian. Hippolytus’ text sometimes

<p>And they despise wealth, and do not turn away from sharing their goods with those that
are destitute. No one amongst them, however, enjoys a greater amount of riches than another.
For a regulation with them is, that an individual coming forward to join the sect must sell
his possessions, and present the price of them to the community. And on receiving the money,
the head of the order distributes it to all according to their necessities. Thus there is no one
among them in distress. And they do not use oil, regarding it as a defilement to be anointed.
And there are appointed overseers, who take care of all things that belong to them in common,
and they all appear always in white clothing.</p>

<p>But there is not one city of them, but many of them settle in every city. And if any of
the adherents of the sect may be present from a strange place, they consider that all things
are in common for him, and those whom they had not previously known they receive as if
they belonged to their own household and kindred. And they traverse their native land, and
on each occasion that they go on a journey they carry nothing except arms. And they have
also in their cities a president, who expends the moneys collected for this purpose in procuring
clothing and food for them. And their robe and its shape are modest. And they do not own
two cloaks, or a double set of shoes; and when those that are in present use become antiquated,
then they adopt others. And they neither buy nor sell anything at all; but whatever
any one has he gives to him that has not, and that which one has not he receives.</p>

<p>And they continue in an orderly manner, and with perseverance pray from early dawn,
and they do not speak a word unless they have praised God in a hymn. And in this way they
each go forth and engage in whatever employment they please; and after having worked up
to the fifth hour they leave off. Then again they come together into one place, and encircle
themselves with linen girdles, for the purpose of concealing their private parts. And in this
manner they perform ablutions in cold water; and after being thus cleansed, they repair together
into one apartment,—now no one who entertains a different opinion from themselves
assembles in the house,—and they proceed to partake of breakfast. And when they have
taken their seats in silence, they set down loaves in order, and next some one sort of food
to eat along with the bread, and each receives from these a sufficient portion. No one, how-
ever, tastes these before the priest utters a blessing,1027 and prays over the food. And after
breakfast, when he has a second time offered up supplication, as at the beginning, so at the
conclusion of their meal they praise God in hymns. Next, after they have laid aside as sacred
the garments in which they have been clothed while together taking their repast within the
house—(now these garments are linen)—and having resumed the clothes which they had left
in the vestibule, they hasten to agreeable occupations until evening. And they partake of
supper, doing all things in like manner to those already mentioned. And no one will at any
time cry aloud, nor will any other tumultuous voice be heard. But they each converse quietly,
and with decorum one concedes the conversation to the other, so that the stillness of those
within the house appears a sort of mystery to those outside. And they are invariably sober,
eating and drinking all things by measure.</p>

with toil. And especially they abstain from wrath and anger, and all such passions, inasmuch
as they consider these to be treacherous to man. And no one amongst them is in the habit
of swearing; but whatever any one says, this is regarded more binding than an oath. If,
however, one will swear, he is condemned as one unworthy of credence. They are likewise
solicitous about the readings of the law and prophets; and moreover also, if there is any
treatise of the faithful, about that likewise. And they evince the utmost curiosity concerning
plants and stones, rather busying themselves as regards the operative powers of these, saying
that these things were not created in vain.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The Tenets of the Esseni Continued.</head>
<p>But to those who wish to become disciples of the sect, they do not immediately deliver
their rules, unless they have previously tried them. Now for the space of a year they set before
(the candidates) the same food, while the latter continue to live in a different house outside
the Essenes’ own place of meeting. And they give (to the probationists) a hatchet and the
linen girdle, and a white robe. When, at the expiration of this period, one affords proof of
self-control, he approaches nearer to the sect’s method of living, and he is washed more
purely than before. Not as yet, however, does he partake of food along with the Essenes. For,
after having furnished evidence as to whether he is able to acquire self-control,—but for
two years the habit of a person of this description is on trial,—and when he has appeared
deserving, he is thus reckoned amongst the members of the sect. Previous, however, to his
being allowed to partake of a repast along with them, he is bound under fearful oaths. First,
that he will worship the Divinity; next, that he will observe just dealings with men, and that
he will in no way injure any one, and that he will not hate a person who injures him, or is
hostile to him, but pray for them. He likewise swears that he will always aid the just, and
keep faith with all, especially those who are rulers. For, they argue, a position of authority
does not happen to any one without God. And if the Essene himself be a ruler, he swears
that he will not conduct himself at any time arrogantly in the exercise of power, nor be
prodigal, nor resort to any adornment, or a greater state of magnificence than the usage
permits. He likewise swears, however, to be a lover of truth, and to reprove him that is guilty
of falsehood, neither to steal, nor pollute his conscience for the sake of iniquitous gain, nor
conceal aught from those that are members of his sect, and to divulge nothing to others,
though one should be tortured even unto death. And in addition to the foregoing promises,
he swears to impart to no one a knowledge of the doctrines in a different manner from that
in which he has received them himself.</p>

<p>With oaths, then, of this description, they bind those who come forward. If, however,
any one may be condemned for any sin, he is expelled from the order; but one that has been
thus excommunicated sometimes perishes by an awful death. For, inasmuch as he is bound
by the oaths and rites of the sect, he is not able to partake of the food in use among other
people. Those that are excommunicated, occasionally, therefore, utterly destroy the body
through starvation. And so it is, that when it comes to the last the Essenes sometimes pity
many of them who are at the point of dissolution, inasmuch as they deem a punishment
even unto death, thus inflicted upon these culprits, a sufficient penalty.</p>

<p>But as regards judicial decisions, the Essenes are most accurate and impartial. And they
deliver their judgments when they have assembled together, numbering at the very least one
hundred; and the sentence delivered by them is irreversible. And they honour the legislator
next after God; and if any one is guilty of blasphemy against this framer of laws, he is punished.
And they are taught to yield obedience to rulers and elders; and if ten occupy seats
in the same room, one of them will not speak unless it will appear expedient to the nine. And
they are careful not to spit out into the midst of persons present, and to the right hand. They
are more solicitous, however, about abstaining from work on the Sabbath-day than all other
Jews. For not only do they prepare their victuals for themselves one day previously, so as
not (on the Sabbath) to kindle a fire, but not even would they move a utensil from one place
to another (on that day), nor ease nature; nay, some would not even rise from a couch. On
other days, however, when they wish to relieve nature, they dig a hole a foot long with the
mattock,—for of this description is the hatchet, which the president in the first instance
gives those who come forward to gain admission as disciples,—and cover (this cavity) on
all sides with their garment, alleging that they do not necessarily1028 insult the sunbeams.
They then replace the upturned soil into the pit; and this is their practice,1029 choosing the
more lonely spots. But after they have performed this operation, immediately they undergo
ablution, as if the excrement pollutes them.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Different Sects of the Esseni.</head>
<p>The Essenes have, however, in the lapse of time, undergone divisions, and they do not
preserve their system of training after a similar manner, inasmuch as they have been split
up into four parties. For some of them discipline themselves above the requisite rules of the
order, so that even they would not handle a current coin of the country, saying that they
ought not either to carry, or behold, or fashion an image:1030 wherefore no one of those
goes into a city, lest (by so doing) he should enter through a gate at which statues are erected,
regarding it a violation of law to pass beneath images. But the adherents of another party,
if they happen to hear any one maintaining a discussion concerning God and His
laws—supposing such to be an uncircumcised person, they will closely watch him and when
they meet a person of this description in any place alone, they will threaten to slay him if
he refuses to undergo the rite of circumcision. Now, if the latter does not wish to comply
with this request, an Essene spares not, but even slaughters. And it is from this occurrence
that they have received their appellation, being denominated (by some) Zelotæ, but by
others Sicarii. And the adherents of another party call no one Lord except the Deity, even
though one should put them to the torture, or even kill them. But there are others of a later
period, who have to such an extent declined from the discipline (of the order), that, as far
as those are concerned who continue in the primitive customs, they would not even touch
these. And if they happen to come in contact with them, they immediately resort to ablution,
as if they had touched one belonging to an alien tribe. But here also there are very many of
them of so great longevity, as even to live longer than a hundred years. They assert, therefore,
that a cause of this arises from their extreme devotion to religion, and their condemnation
of all excess in regard of what is served up (as food), and from their being temperate and
incapable of anger. And so it is that they despise death, rejoicing when they can finish their
course with a good conscience. If, however, any one would even put to the torture persons
of this description, in order to induce any amongst them either to speak evil of the law, or
eat what is offered in sacrifice to an idol, he will not effect his purpose; for one of this party
submits to death and endures torment rather than violate his conscience.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Belief of the Esseni in the Resurrection; Their System a Suggestive
One.</head>
<p>Now the doctrine of the resurrection has also derived support among these; for they
acknowledge both that the flesh will rise again, and that it will be immortal, in the same
manner as the soul is already imperishable. And they maintain that the soul, when separated
in the present life, (departs) into one place, which is well ventilated and lightsome, where,
they say, it rests until judgment. And this locality the Greeks were acquainted with by hearsay,
and called it “Isles of the Blessed.” And there are other tenets of these which many of the
Greeks have appropriated, and thus have from time to time formed their own opinions.1031
For the disciplinary system in regard of the Divinity, according to these (Jewish sects), is of
greater antiquity than that of all nations. And so it is that the proof is at hand, that all those
(Greeks) who ventured to make assertions concerning God, or concerning the creation of
existing things, derived their principles from no other source than from Jewish legislation.
And among these may be particularized Pythagoras especially, and the Stoics, who derived
(their systems) while resident among the Egyptians, by having become disciples of these
Jews.1032 Now they affirm that there will be both a judgment and a conflagration of the
universe, and that the wicked will be eternally punished. And among them is cultivated the
practice of prophecy, and the prediction of future events.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Another Sect of the Esseni: the Pharisees.</head>
<p>There is then another order of the Essenes who use the same customs and prescribed
method of living with the foregoing sects, but make an alteration from these in one respect,
viz., marriage. Now they maintain that those who have abrogated matrimony commit some
terrible offence, which is for the destruction of life, and that they ought not to cut off the
succession of children; for, that if all entertained this opinion, the entire race of men would
easily be exterminated. However, they make a trial of their betrothed women for a period
of three years; and when they have been three times purified, with a view of proving their
ability of bringing forth children, so then they wed. They do not, however, cohabit with
pregnant women, evincing that they marry not from sensual motives, but from the advantage
of children. And the women likewise undergo ablution in a similar manner (with their
husbands), and are themselves also arrayed in a linen garment, after the mode in which the
men are with their girdles. These things, then, are the statements which I have to make respecting
the Esseni.</p>
<p>But there are also others who themselves practise the Jewish customs; and these, both
in respect of caste and in respect of the laws, are called Pharisees. Now the greatest part of
these is to be found in every locality, inasmuch as, though all are styled Jews, yet, on account
of the peculiarity of the opinions advanced by them, they have been denominated by titles
proper to each. These, then, firmly hold the ancient tradition, and continue to pursue in a
disputative spirit a close investigation into the things regarded according to the Law as clean
and not clean. And they interpret the regulations of the Law, and put forward teachers,
whom they qualify for giving instruction in such things. These Pharisees affirm the existence
of fate, and that some things are in our power, whereas others are under the control of destiny.
In this way they maintain that some actions depend upon ourselves, whereas others upon
fate. But (they assert) that God is a cause of all things, and that nothing is managed or happens
without His will. These likewise acknowledge that there is a resurrection of flesh, and that
soul is immortal, and that there will be a judgment and conflagration, and that the righteous
will be imperishable, but that the wicked will endure everlasting punishment in unquenchable
fire.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
<pb n="355"/>
<head>Chapter XXIV.—The Sadducees.</head>
<p>These, then, are the opinions even of the Pharisees. The Sadducees, however, are for
abolishing fate, and they acknowledge that God does nothing that is wicked, nor exercises
providence over (earthly concerns); but they contend that the choice between good and evil
lies within the power of men. And they deny that there is a resurrection not only of flesh,
but also they suppose that the soul does not continue after death. The soul they consider
nothing but mere vitality, and that it is on account of this that man has been created. However,
(they maintain) that the notion of the resurrection has been fully realized by the single circumstance,
that we close our days after having left children upon earth. But (they still insist)
that after death one expects to suffer nothing, either bad or good; for that there will be a
dissolution both of soul and body, and that man passes into non-existence, similarly also
with the material of the animal creation. But as regards whatever wickedness a man may
have committed in life, provided he may have been reconciled to the injured party, he has
been a gainer (by transgression), inasmuch as he has escaped the punishment (that otherwise
would have been inflicted) by men. And whatever acquisitions a man may have made, and
(in whatever respect), by becoming wealthy, he may have acquired distinction, he has so far
been a gainer. But (they abide by their assertion), that God has no solicitude about the
concerns of an individual here. And while the Pharisees are full of mutual affection, the
Sadducees, on the other hand, are actuated by self-love. This sect had its stronghold especially
in the region around Samaria. And these also adhere to the customs of the law, saying that
one ought so to live, that he may conduct himself virtuously, and leave children behind him
on earth. They do not, however, devote attention to prophets, but neither do they to any
other sages, except to the law of Moses only, in regard of which, however, they frame no interpretations.
These, then, are the opinions which also the Sadducees choose to teach.</p>

<pb n="356"/>
<head>Chapter XXV.—The Jewish Religion.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, we have explained even the diversities among the Jews, it seems expedient
likewise not to pass over in silence the system of their religion. The doctrine, therefore,
among all Jews on the subject of religion is fourfold-theological, natural, moral, and ceremonial.
And they affirm that there is one God, and that He is Creator and Lord of the universe:
that He has formed all these glorious works which had no previous existence; and
this, too, not out of any coeval substance that lay ready at hand, but His Will—the efficient
cause—was to create, and He did create. And (they maintain) that there are angels, and that
these have been brought into being for ministering unto the creation; but also that there is
a sovereign Spirit that always continues beside God, for glory and praise. And that all things
in the creation are endued with sensation, and that there is nothing inanimate. And they
earnestly aim at serious habits and a temperate life, as one may ascertain from their laws.
Now these matters have long ago been strictly defined by those who in ancient times have
received the divinely-appointed law;1033 so that the reader will find himself astonished at
the amount of temperance, and of diligence, lavished on customs legally enacted in reference
to man. The ceremonial service, however, which has been adapted to divine worship in a
manner befitting the dignity of religion, has been practised amongst them with the highest
degree of elaboration. The superiority of their ritualism it is easy for those who wish it to
ascertain, provided they read the book which furnishes information on these points. They
will thus perceive how that with solemnity and sanctity the Jewish priests offer unto God the
first-fruits of the gifts bestowed by Him for the use and enjoyment of men; how they fulfil
their ministrations with regularity and stedfastness, in obedience to His commandments.
There are, however, some (liturgical usages adopted) by these, which the Sadducees refuse
to recognise, for they are not disposed to acquiesce in the existence of angels or spirits.</p>
<p>Still all parties alike expect Messiah, inasmuch as the Law certainly, and the prophets,
preached beforehand that He was about to be present on earth. Inasmuch, however, as the
Jews were not cognizant of the period of His advent, there remains the supposition that the
declarations (of Scripture) concerning His coming have not been fulfilled. And so it is, that
up to this day they continue in anticipation of the future coming of the Christ,—from the
fact of their not discerning Him when He was present in the world. And (yet there can be
little doubt but) that, on beholding the signs of the times of His having been already amongst
us, the Jews are troubled; and that they are ashamed to confess that He has come, since they
have with their own hands put Him to death, because they were stung with indignation in
being convicted by Himself of not having obeyed the laws. And they affirm that He who
was thus sent forth by God is not this Christ (whom they are looking for); but they confess
that another Messiah will come, who as yet has no existence; and that he will usher in some
<note type="footnote">1033 Or, “the law not of yesterday,” οὑ νεωστὶ τὸν νόμον. Cruice reads θεόκτιστον , as rendered above.</note>

<pb n="357"/>
of the signs which the law and the prophets have shown beforehand, whereas, regarding the
rest (of these indications), they suppose that they have fallen into error. For they say that
his generation will be from the stock of David, but not from a virgin and the Holy Spirit,
but from a woman and a man, according as it is a rule for all to be procreated from seed.
And they allege that this Messiah will be King over them,—a warlike and powerful individual,
who, after having gathered together the entire people of the Jews, and having done battle
with all the nations, will restore for them Jerusalem the royal city. And into this city He will
collect together the entire Hebrew race, and bring it back once more into the ancient customs,
that it may fulfil the regal and sacerdotal functions, and dwell in confidence for periods of
time of sufficient duration. After this repose, it is their opinion that war would next be waged
against them after being thus congregated; that in this conflict Christ would fall by the edge
of the sword; and that, after no long time, would next succeed the termination and conflagration
of the universe; and that in this way their opinions concerning the resurrection would
receive completion, and a recompense be rendered to each man according to his works.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Conclusion to the Work Explained.</head>
<p>It now seems to us that the tenets of both all the Greeks and barbarians have been sufficiently
explained by us, and that nothing has remained unrefuted either of the points about
which philosophy has been busied, or of the allegations advanced by the heretics. And from
these very explanations the condemnation of the heretics is obvious, for having either purloined
their doctrines, or derived contributions to them from some of those tenets elaborately
worked out by the Greeks, and for having advanced (these opinions) as if they originated
from God. Since, therefore, we have hurriedly passed through all the systems of these, and
with much labour have, in the nine books, proclaimed all their opinions, and have left behind
us for all men a small viaticum in life, and to those who are our contemporaries have afforded
a desire of learning (with) great joy and delight, we have considered it reasonable, as a
crowning stroke to the entire work, to introduce the discourse (already mentioned) concerning
the truth, and to furnish our delineation of this in one book, namely the tenth. Our object
is, that the reader, not only when made acquainted with the overthrow of those who have
presumed to establish heresies, may regard with scorn their idle fancies, but also, when
brought to know the power of the truth, may be placed in the way of salvation, by reposing
that faith in God which He so worthily deserves.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Recapitulation.</head>
<p>After we have, not with violence, burst through the labyrinth1034 of heresies, but have
unravelled (their intricacies) through a refutation merely, or, in other words, by the force
of truth, we approach the demonstration of the truth itself. For then the artificial sophisms
of error will be exposed in all their inconsistency, when we shall succeed in establishing
whence it is that the definition of the truth has been derived. The truth has not taken its
principles from the wisdom of the Greeks, nor borrowed its doctrines, as secret mysteries,
from the tenets of the Egyptians, which, albeit silly, are regarded amongst them with religious
veneration as worthy of reliance. Nor has it been formed out of the fallacies which enunciate
the incoherent (conclusions arrived at through the) curiosity of the Chaldeans. Nor does
the truth owe its existence to astonishment, through the operations of demons, for the irrational
frenzy of the Babylonians. But its definition is constituted after the manner in which
every true definition is, viz., as simple and unadorned. A definition such as this, provided
it is made manifest, will of itself refute error. And although we have very frequently propounded
demonstrations, and with sufficient fulness elucidated for those willing (to learn)
the rule of the truth; yet even now, after having discussed all the opinions put forward by
the Greeks and heretics, we have decided it not to be, at all events, unreasonable to introduce,
as a sort of finishing stroke to the (nine) books preceding, this demonstration throughout
the tenth book.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Summary of the Opinions of Philosophers.</head>
<p>Having, therefore, embraced (a consideration of) the tenets of all the wise men among
the Greeks in four books, and the doctrines propounded by the heresiarchs in five, we shall
now exhibit the doctrine concerning the truth in one, having first presented in a summary
the suppositions entertained severally by all. For the dogmatists of the Greeks, dividing
philosophy into three parts, in this manner devised from time to time their speculative systems;
1035 some denominating their system Natural, and others Moral, but others Dialectical
Philosophy. And the ancient thinkers who called their science Natural Philosophy, were those
mentioned in book i. And the account which they furnished was after this mode: Some of
them derived all things from one, whereas others from more things than one. And of those
who derived all things from one, some derived them from what was devoid of quality,
whereas others from what was endued with quality. And among those who derived all things
from quality, some derived them from fire, and some from air, and some from water, and
some from earth. And among those who derived the universe from more things than one,
some derived it from numerable, but others from infinite quantities. And among those who
derived all things from numerable quantities, some derived them from two, and others from
four, and others from five, and others from six. And among those who derived the universe
from infinite quantities, some derived entities from things similar to those generated,
whereas others from things dissimilar. And among these some derived entities from things
incapable of, whereas others from things capable of, passion. From a body devoid of quality
and endued with unity, the Stoics, then, accounted for the generation of the universe. For,
according to them, matter devoid of quality, and in all its parts susceptible of change, constitutes
an originating principle of the universe. For, when an alteration of this ensues, there
is generated fire, air, water, earth. The followers, however, of Hippasus, and Anaximander,
and Thales the Milesian, are disposed to think that all things have been generated from one
(an entity), endued with quality. Hippasus of Metapontum and Heraclitus the Ephesian
declared the origin of things to be from fire, whereas Anaximander from air, but Thales from
water, and Xenophanes from earth. “For from earth,” says he, “are all things, and all things
terminate in the earth.”1036</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Summary of the Opinions of Philosophers Continued.</head>
<p>But among those who derive all entities from more things than one, and from numerable
quantities, the poet Homer asserts that the universe consists of two substances, namely earth
and water; at one time expressing himself thus:—
<lg>
<l>“The source of gods was Sea and Mother Earth.”1037</l>
<l>And on another occasion thus:—</l>
<l>“But indeed ye all might become water and earth.”1038</l>
<l>And Xenophanes of Colophon seems to coincide with him, for he says:—</l>
<l>“We all are sprung from water and from earth.”1039</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Euripides, however, (derives the universe) from earth and air, as one may ascertain from
the following assertion of his:—
<lg>
<l>“Mother of all, air and earth, I sing.”1040</l>
<l>But Empedocles derives the universe from four principles, expressing himself thus:—</l>
<l>“Four roots of all things hear thou first:</l>
<l>Brilliant Jove, and life-giving Juno and Aidoneus,</l>
<l>And Nestis, that with tears bedews the Mortal Font.”1041</l>
</lg>
</p> 
<p>Ocellus, however, the Lucanian, and Aristotle, derive the universe from five principles;
for, along with the four elements, they have assumed the existence of a fifth, and (that this
is) a body with a circular motion; and they say that from this, things celestial have their being.
But the disciples of Empedocles supposed the generation of the universe to have proceeded
from six principles. For in the passage where he says, “Four roots of all things hear thou
first,” he produces generation out of four principles. When, however, he subjoins,—
<lg>
<l>“Ruinous Strife apart from these, equal in every point,</l>
<l>And with them Friendship equal in length and breadth,”1042—</l>

<pb n="363"/>
he also delivers six principles of the universe, four of them material—earth, water, fire,
and air; but two of them formative—Friendship and Discord. The followers, however, of
Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, and of Democritus, and of Epicurus, and multitudes of others,
have given it as their opinion that the generation of the universe proceeds from infinite
numbers of atoms; and we have previously made partial mention of these philosophers. But
Anaxagoras derives the universe from things similar to those that are being produced;
whereas the followers of Democritus and Epicurus derived the universe from things both
dissimilar (to the entities produced), and devoid of passion, that is, from atoms. But the
followers of Heraclides of Pontus, and of Asclepiades, derived the universe from things dissimilar
(to the entities produced), and capable of passion, as if from incongruous corpuscles.
But the disciples of Plato affirm that these entities are from three principles—God, and
Matter, and Exemplar. He divides matter, however, into four principles—fire, water, earth,
and air. And (he says) that God is the Creator of this (matter), and that Mind is its exemplar.

<head>Chapter V.—The Naasseni.</head>
<p>But since it so appears expedient, let us begin first from the public worshippers of the
serpent. The Naasseni call the first principle of the universe a Man, and that the same also
is a Son of Man; and they divide this man into three portions. For they say one part of him
is rational, and another psychical, but a third earthly. And they style him Adamas, and
suppose that the knowledge appertaining to him is the originating cause of the capacity of
knowing God. And the Naassene asserts that all these rational, and psychical, and earthly
qualities have retired into Jesus, and that through Him these three substances simultaneously
have spoken unto the three genera of the universe. These allege that there are three kinds
of existence—angelic, psychical, and earthly; and that there are three churches—angelic,
psychical, and earthly; and that the names for these are—chosen, called, and captive. These
are the heads of doctrine advanced by them, as far as one may briefly comprehend them.
They affirm that James, the brother of the Lord, delivered these tenets to Mariamne, by such
a statement belying both.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="366"/>
<head>Chapter VI.—The Peratæ.</head>
<p>The Peratæ, however, viz., Ademes the Carystian, and Euphrates the Peratic, say that
there is some one world,—this is the denomination they use,—and affirming that it is divided
into three parts. But of the threefold division, according to them, there is one principle, just
like an immense fountain, capable of being by reason divided into infinite segments. And
the first segment, and the one of more proximity, according to them, is the triad, and is
called a perfect good, and a paternal magnitude. But the second portion of the triad is a
certain multitude of, as it were, infinite powers. The third part, however, is formal. And the
first is unbegotten;1044 whence they expressly affirm that there are three Gods, three Logoi,
three minds, (and) three men. For when the division has been accomplished, to each part
of the world they assign both Gods, and Logoi, and men, and the rest. But from above, from
uncreatedness and the first segment of the world, when afterwards the world had attained
to its consummation, the Peratic affirms that there came down, in the times of Herod, a
certain man with a threefold nature, and a threefold body, and a threefold power, named
Christ, and that He possesses from the three parts of the world in Himself all the concretions
and capacities of the world. And they are disposed to think that this is what has been declared,
“in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”1045 And they assert that from the
two worlds situated above—namely, both the unbegotten one and self-begotten one—there
were borne down into this world in which we are, germs of all sorts of powers. And (they
say) that Christ came down from above from uncreatedness, in order that, by His descent,
all things that have been divided into three parts may be saved. For, says the Peratic, the
things that have been borne down from above will ascend through Him; and the things that
have plotted against those that have been borne down are heedlessly rejected,1046 and sent
away to be punished. And the Peratic states that there are two parts which are saved—that
is, those that are situated above—by having been separated from corruption, and that the
third is destroyed, which he calls a formal world. These also are the tenets of the Peratæ.</p>

<pb n="367"/>
<head>Chapter VII.—The Sethians.</head>
<p>But to the Sethians it seems that there exist three principles, which have been precisely
defined. And each of the principles is fitted by nature for being able to be generated, as in
a human soul every art whatsoever is developed which is capable of being learned. The result
is the same as when a child, by being long conversant with a musical instrument, becomes
a musician; or with geometry a geometrician, or with any other art, with a similar result.
And the essences of the principles, the Sethians say, are light and darkness. And in the midst
of these is pure spirit; and the spirit, they say, is that which is placed intermediate between
darkness, which is below, and light, which is above. It is not spirit, as a current of wind or
a certain gentle breeze which may be felt, but just as if some fragrance of ointment or incense
made out of a refined mixture,—a power diffusing itself by some impulse of fragrance which
is inconceivable and superior to what one can express. Since, therefore, the light is above
and the darkness below, and the spirit is intermediate between these, the light, also, as a ray
of sun, shines from above on the underlying darkness. And the fragrance of the spirit is
wafted onwards, occupying an intermediate position, and proceeds forth, just as is diffused
the odour of incense-offerings (laid) upon the fire. Now the power of the things divided
threefold being of this description, the power simultaneously of the spirit and of the light
is below, in the darkness that is situated beneath. The darkness, however, they say, is a horrible
water, into which the light along with the spirit is absorbed, and thus translated into
a nature of this description. The darkness being then endued with intelligence, and knowing
that when the light has been removed from it the darkness continues desolate, devoid of
radiance and splendour, power and efficiency, as well as impotent, (therefore,) by every effort
of reflection and of reason, this makes an exertion to comprise in itself brilliancy, and a
scintillation of light, along with the fragrance of the spirit. And of this they introduce the
following image, expressing themselves thus: Just as the pupil of the eye appears dark beneath
the underlying humours, but is illuminated by the spirit, so the darkness earnestly strives
after the spirit, and has with itself all the powers which wish to retire and return. Now these
are indefinitely infinite, from which, when commingled, all things are figured and generated
like seals. For just as a seal, when brought into contact with wax, produces a figure, (and yet
the seal) itself remains of itself what it was, so also the powers, by coming into communion
(one with the other), form all the infinite kinds of animals. The Sethians assert that, therefore,
from the primary concourse of the three principles was generated an image of the great seal,
namely heaven and earth, having a form like a womb, possessing a navel in the midst. And
so that the rest of the figures of all things were, like heaven and earth, fashioned similar to
a womb.</p>
<p>And the Sethians say that from the water was produced a first-begotten principle, namely
a vehement and boisterous wind, and that it is a cause of all generation, which creates a sort
of heat and motion in the world from the motion of the waters. And they maintain that this

<pb n="368"/>
wind is fashioned like the hissing of a serpent into a perfect image. And on this the world
gazes and hurries into generation, being inflamed as a womb; and from thence they are
disposed to think that the generation of the universe has arisen. And they say that this wind
constitutes a spirit, and that a perfect God has arisen from the fragrance of the waters, and
that of the spirit, and from the brilliant light. And they affirm that mind exists after the mode
of generation from a female—(meaning by mind) the supernal spark—and that, having
been mingled beneath with the compounds of body, it earnestly desires to flee away, that
escaping it may depart and not find dissolution on account of the deficiency in the waters.
Wherefore it is in the habit of crying aloud from the mixture of the waters, according to the
Psalmist, as they say, “For the entire anxiety of the light above is, that it may deliver the
spark which is below from the Father beneath,”1047 that is, from wind. And the Father creates
heat and disturbance, and produces for Himself a Son, namely mind, which, as they allege,
is not the peculiar offspring of Himself. And these heretics affirm that the Son, on beholding
the perfect Logos of the supernal light, underwent a transformation, and in the shape of a
serpent entered into a womb, in order that he might be able to recover that Mind which is
the scintillation from the light. And that this is what has been declared, “Who, being in the
form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made Himself of no reputation,
and took upon Him the form of a servant.”1048 And the wretched and baneful Sethians are
disposed to think that this constitutes the servile form alluded to by the Apostle. These, then,
are the assertions which likewise these Sethians advance.</p>

they assert that there are four incomposite elements, and have supposed fire, as one of these,
to be uncompounded. Simon, on the other hand, alleges that the nature of fire is twofold;
and one portion of this twofold (nature) he calls a something secret, and another (a something)
manifest. And he asserts that the secret is concealed in the manifest parts of the fire,
and that the manifest parts of the fire have been produced from the secret. And he says that
all the parts of the fire, visible and invisible, have been supposed to be in possession of a
capacity of perception. The world, therefore, he says, that is begotten, has been produced
from the unbegotten fire. And it commenced, he says, to exist thus: The Unbegotten One
took six primal roots of the principle of generation from the principle of that fire. For he
maintains that these roots have been generated in pairs from the fire; and these he denominates
Mind and Intelligence, Voice and Name, Ratiocination and Reflection. And he asserts
that in the six roots, at the same time, resides the indefinite power, which he affirms to be
Him that stood, stands, and will stand. And when this one has been formed into a figure,
He will, according to this heretic, exist in the six powers substantially and potentially. And
He will be in magnitude and perfection one and the same with that unbegotten and indefinite
power, possessing no attribute in any respect more deficient than that unbegotten, and unalterable,
and indefinite power. If, however, He who stood, stands, and will stand, continues
to exist only potentially in the six powers, and has not assumed any definite figure, He becomes,
says Simon, utterly evanescent, and perishes. And this takes place in the same manner
as the grammatical or geometrical capacity, which, though it has been implanted in man’s
soul, suffers extinction when it does not obtain (the assistance of) a master of either of these
arts, who would indoctrinate that soul into its principles. Now Simon affirms that he himself
is He who stood, stands, and will stand, and that He is a power that is above all things. So
far, then, for the opinions of Simon likewise.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Valentinus.</head>
<p>Valentinus,1049 however, and the adherents of this school, though they agree in asserting
that the originating principle of the universe is the Father, still they are impelled into the
adoption of a contrary opinion respecting Him. For some of them maintain that (the Father)
is solitary and generative; whereas others hold the impossibility, (in His as in other cases,)
of procreation without a female. They therefore add Sige as the spouse of this Father, and
style the Father Himself Bythus. From this Father and His spouse some allege that there
have been six projections,—viz., Nous and Aletheia, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia,—
and that this constitutes the procreative Ogdoad. And the Valentinians maintain that
those are the first projections which have taken place within the limit, and have been again
denominated “those within the Pleroma;” and the second are “those without the Pleroma;”
and the third, “those without the Limit.” Now the generation of these constitutes the Hysterema
Acamoth. And he asserts that what has been generated from an Æon, that exists in
the Hysterema and has been projected (beyond the Limit), is the Creator. But Valentinus
is not disposed to affirm what is thus generated to be primal Deity, but speaks in detractive
terms both of Him and the things made by Him. And (he asserts) that Christ came down
from within the Pleroma for the salvation of the spirit who had erred. This spirit, (according
to the Valentinians,) resides in our inner man; and they say that this inner man obtains
salvation on account of this indwelling spirit. Valentinus, however, (to uphold the doctrine,)
determines that the flesh is not saved, and styles it “a leathern tunic,” and the perishable
portion of man. I have (already) declared these tenets in the way of an epitome, inasmuch
as in their systems there exists enlarged matter for discussion, and a variety of opinions. In
this manner, then, it seems proper also to the school of Valentinus to propound their opinions.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Basilides.</head>
<p>But Basilides also himself affirms that there is a non-existent God, who, being non-existent,
has made the non-existent world, that has been formed out of things that are not, by
casting down a certain seed, as it were a grain of mustard-seed, having in itself stem, leaves,
branches, and fruit. Or this seed is as a peacock’s egg, comprising in itself the varied multitude
of colours. And this, say the Basilidians, constitutes the seed of the world, from which all
things have been produced. For they maintain that it comprises in itself all things, as it were
those that as yet are non-existent, and which it has been predetermined to be brought into
existence by the non-existent Deity. There was, then, he says, in the seed itself a threefold
Sonship, in all respects of the same substance with the nonexistent God, which has been
begotten from things that are not. And of this Sonship, divided into three parts, one portion
of it was refined, and another gross, and another requiring purification. The refined portion,
when first the earliest putting down of the seed was accomplished by the non-existent God,
immediately burst forth, and ascended upwards, and proceeded towards the non-existent
Deity. For every nature yearns after that God on account of the excess of His beauty, but
different (creatures desire Him) from different causes. The more gross portion, however,
still continues in the seed; and inasmuch as it is a certain imitative nature, it was not able
to soar upwards, for it was more gross than the subtle part. The more gross portion, however,
equipped itself with the Holy Spirit, as it were with wings; for the Sonship, thus arrayed,
shows kindness to this Spirit, and in turn receives kindness. The third Sonship, however,
requires purification, and therefore this continued in the conglomeration of all germs, and
this displays and receives kindness. And (Basilides asserts) that there is something which is
called “world,” and something else (which is called) supra-mundane; for entities are distributed
by him into two primary divisions. And what is intermediate between these he calls
“Conterminous Holy Spirit,” and (this Spirit) has in itself the fragrance of the Sonship.</p>
<p>From the conglomeration of all germs of the cosmical seed burst forth and was begotten
the Great Archon, the head of the world, an Æon of inexpressible beauty and size. This
(Archon) having raised Himself as far as the firmament, supposed that there was not another
above Himself. And accordingly He became more brilliant and powerful than all the underlying
Æons, with the exception of the Sonship that had been left beneath, but which He was
not aware was more wise than Himself. This one having His attention turned to the creation
of the world, first begat a son unto Himself, superior to Himself; and this son He caused to
sit on His own right hand, and this these Basilidians allege is the Ogdoad. The Great Archon
Himself, then, produces the entire celestial creation. And other Archon ascended from (the
conglomeration of) all the germs, who was greater than all the underlying Æon, except the
Sonship that had been left behind, yet far inferior to the former one. And they style this
second Archon a Hebdomad. He is Maker, and Creator, and Controller of all things that

<pb n="372"/>
are beneath Him, and this Archon produced for Himself a Son more prudent and wiser than
Himself. Now they assert that all these things exist according to the predetermination of
that non-existent God, and that there exist also worlds and intervals that are infinite. And
the Basilidians affirm that upon Jesus, who was born of Mary, came the power of the Gospel,
which descended and illuminated the Son both of the Ogdoad and of the Hebdomad. And
this took place for the purpose of enlightening and distinguishing from the different orders
of beings, and purifying the Sonship that had been left behind for conferring benefits on
souls, and the receiving benefits in turn. And they say that themselves are sons, who are in
the world for this cause, that by teaching they may purify souls, and along with the Sonship
may ascend to the Father above, from whom proceeded the first Sonship. And they allege
that the world endures until the period when all souls may have repaired thither along with
the Sonship. These, however, are the opinions which Basilides, who detailed them as
prodigies, is not ashamed to advance.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Justinus.</head>
<p>But Justinus also himself attempted to establish similar opinions with these, and expresses
himself thus: That there are three unbegotten principles of the universe, two males and one
female. And of the males one principle is denominated “Good.” Now this alone is called
after this mode, and is endued with a foreknowledge of the universe. And the other is
Father of all generated entities, and is devoid of foreknowledge, and unknown, and invisible,
and is called Elohim. The female principle is devoid of foreknowledge, passionate, with two
minds, and with two bodies, as we have minutely detailed in the previous discourses concerning
this heretic’s system. This female principle, in her upper parts, as far as the groin, is,
the Justinians say, a virgin, whereas from the groin downwards a snake. And such is denominated
Edem and Israel. This heretic alleges that these are the principles of the universe, from
which all things have been produced. And he asserts that Elohim, without foreknowledge,
passed into inordinate desire for the half virgin, and that having had intercourse with her,
he begot twelve angels; and the names of these he states to be those already given. And of
these the paternal ones are connected with the father, and the maternal with the mother.
And Justinus maintains that these are (the trees of Paradise), concerning which Moses has
spoken in an allegorical sense the things written in the law. And Justinus affirms that all
things were made by Elohim and Edem. And (he says) that animals, with the rest of the
creatures of this kind, are from the a part resembling a beast, whereas man from the parts
above the groin. And Edem (is supposed by Justinus) to have deposited in man himself the
soul, which was her own power, (but Elohim the spirit.) And Justinus alleges that this Elohim,
after having learned his origin, ascended to the Good Being, and deserted Edem. And this
heretic asserts that Edem, enraged on account of such (treatment), concocted all this plot
against the spirit of Elohim which he deposited in man. And (Justinus informs us) that for
this reason the Father sent Baruch, and issued directions to the prophets, in order that the
spirit of Elohim might be delivered, and that all might be seduced away from Edem. But
(this heretic) alleges that even Hercules was a prophet, and that he was worsted by Omphale,
that is, by Babel; and the Justinians call the latter Venus. And (they say) that afterwards, in
the days of Herod, Jesus was born son of Mary and Joseph, to whom he alleges Baruch had
spoken. And (Justinus asserts) that Edem plotted against this (Jesus), but could not deceive
him; and for this reason, that she caused him to be crucified. And the spirit of Jesus, (says
Justinus,) ascended to the Good Being. And (the Justinians maintain) that the spirits of all
who thus obey those silly and futile discourses will be saved, and that the body and soul of
Edem have been left behind. But the foolish Justinus calls this (Edem) Earth.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—The Docetæ.</head>
<p>Now the Docetæ advance assertions of this description: that the primal Deity is as a
seed of the fig-tree; and that from this proceeded three Æons as the stem, and the leaves
and the fruit; and that these projected thirty Æons, each (of them) ten; and that they were
all united in decades, but differed only in positions, as some were before others. And (the
Docetæ assert) that infinite Æons were indefinitely projected, and that all these were
hermaphrodites. And (they say) that these Æons formed a design of simultaneously going
together into one Æon, and that from this the intermediate Æon and from the Virgin Mary
they begot a Saviour of all. And this Redeemer was like in every respect to the first seed of
the fig-tree, but inferior in this respect, from the fact of His having been begotten; for the
seed whence the fig-tree springs is unbegotten. This, then, was the great light of the Æons—it
was entirely radiance—which receives no adornment, and comprises in itself the forms of
all animals. And the Docetæ maintain that this light, on proceeding into the underlying
chaos, afforded a cause (of existence) to the things that were produced, and those actually
existing, and that on coming down from above it impressed on chaos beneath the forms of
everlasting species. For the third Æon, which had tripled itself, when he perceives that all
his characteristic attributes were forcibly drawn off into the nether darkness, and not being
ignorant both of the terror of darkness and the simplicity of light, proceeded to create
heaven; and after having rendered firm what intervened, He separated the darkness from
the light. As all the species of the third Æon were, he says, overcome by the darkness, the
figure even of this Æon became a living fire, having been generated by light. And from this
(source), they allege, was generated the Great Archon, regarding whom Moses converses,
saying that He is a fiery Deity and Demiurge, who also continually alters the forms of all
(Æons) into bodies. And the (Docetæ) allege that these are the souls for whose sake the Saviour
was begotten, and that He points out the way through which the souls will escape that
are (now) overpowered (by darkness). And (the Docetæ maintain) that Jesus arrayed Himself
in that only-begotten power, and that for this reason He could not be seen by any, on account
of the excessive magnitude of His glory. And they say that all the occurrences took place
with Him as it has been written in the Gospels.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="375"/>
<head>Chapter XIII.—Monoïmus.</head>
<p>But the followers of Monoïmus the Arabian assert that the originating principle of the
universe is a primal man and son of man; and that, as Moses states, the things that have
been produced were produced not by the primal man, but by the Son of that primal man,
yet not by the entire Son, but by part of Him. And (Monoïmus asserts) that the Son of man
is iota, which stands for ten, the principal number in which is (inherent) the subsistence of
all number (in general, and) through which every number (in particular) consists, as well
as the generation of the universe, fire, air, water, and earth. But inasmuch as this is one iota
and one tittle, and what is perfect (emanates) from what is perfect, or, in other words, a tittle
flows down from above, containing all things in itself; (therefore,) whatsoever things also
the man possesses, the Father of the Son of man possesses likewise. Moses, therefore, says
that the world was made in six days, that is, by six powers, out of which the world was made
by the one tittle. For cubes, and octahedrons, and pyramids, and all figures similar to these,
having equal superficies, out of which consist fire, air, water, and earth, have been produced
from numbers comprehended in that simple tittle of the iota, which is Son of man. When,
therefore, says (Monoïmus), Moses mentions the rod’s being brandished for the purpose
of bringing the plagues upon Egypt, he alludes allegorically to the (alterations of the) world
of iota; nor did he frame more than ten plagues. If, however, says he, you wish to become
acquainted with the universe, search within yourself who is it that says, “My soul, my flesh,
and my mind,” and who is it that appropriates each one thing unto himself, as another
(would do) for himself. Understand that this is a perfect one arising from (one that is) perfect,
and that he considers as his own all so-called nonentities and all entities. These, then, are
the opinions of Monoïmus also.</p>

in nothing differs from Marcion, as appertaining both to his slanders, and the regulations

<head>Chapter XV.—Marcion and Cerdo.</head>
<p>But Marcion, of Pontus, and Cerdon,1051 his preceptor, themselves also lay down that
there are three principles of the universe—good, just, and matter. Some disciples, however,
of these add a fourth, saying, good, just, evil, and matter. But they all affirm that the good
(Being) has made nothing at all, though some denominate the just one likewise evil, whereas
others that his only title is that of just. And they allege that (the just Being) made all things
out of subjacent matter, for that he made them not well, but irrationally. For it is requisite
that the things made should be similar to the maker; wherefore also they thus employ the
evangelical parables, saying, “A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,”1052 and the rest of
the passage. Now Marcion alleges that the conceptions badly devised by the (just one) himself
constituted the allusion in this passage. And (he says) that Christ is the Son of the good
Being, and was sent for the salvation of souls by him whom he styles the inner than. And
he asserts that he appeared as a man though not being a man, and as incarnate though not
being incarnate. And he maintains that his manifestation was only phantastic, and that he
underwent neither generation nor passion except in appearance. And he will not allow that
flesh rises again; but in affirming marriage to be destruction, he leads his disciples towards
a very cynical life. And by these means he imagines that he annoys the Creator, if he should
abstain from the things that are made or appointed by Him.</p>

four gods. And the first of these he alleges to be the “Good Being,” whom the prophets did
not know, and Christ to be His Son. And the second God, he affirms to be the Creator of
the universe, and Him he does not wish to be a God. And the third God, he states to be the
fiery one that was manifested; and the fourth to be an evil one. And Apelles calls these angels;
and by adding (to their number) Christ likewise, he will assert Him to be a fifth God. But
this heretic is in the habit of devoting his attention to a book which he calls “Revelations”
of a certain Philumene, whom he considers a prophetess. And he affirms that Christ did
not receive his flesh from the Virgin, but from the adjacent substance of the world. In this
manner he composed his treatises against the law and the prophets, and attempts to abolish
them as if they had spoken falsehoods, and had not known God. And Apelles, similarly with

knows not the God (that is) above all things. And he says that Jesus was not born of a virgin,
but that He sprang from Joseph and Mary as their son, similar to the rest of men; and that
He excelled in justice, and prudence, and understanding above all the rest of mankind. And
Cerinthus maintains that, after Jesus’ baptism, Christ came down in the form of a dove upon
Him from the sovereignty that is above the whole circle of existence, and that then He proceeded
to preach the unknown Father, and to work miracles. And he asserts that, at the
conclusion of the passion, Christ flew away from Jesus,1053 but that Jesus suffered, and that

to some mode of this description. And Theodotus affirms that Christ is a man of a kindred
nature with all men, but that He surpasses them in this respect, that, according to the
counsel of God, He had been born of a virgin, and the Holy Ghost had overshadowed His
mother. This heretic, however, maintained that Jesus had not assumed flesh in the womb of
the Virgin, but that afterwards Christ descended upon Jesus at His baptism in form of a
dove. And from this circumstance, the followers of Theodotus affirm that at first miraculous
powers did not acquire operating energy in the Saviour Himself. Theodotus, however, determines
to deny the divinity of Christ. Now, opinions of this description were advanced

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Noetus and Callistus.</head>
<p>But in like manner, also, Noetus, being by birth a native of Smyrna, and a fellow addicted
to reckless babbling, as well as crafty withal, introduced (among us) this heresy which originated
from one Epigonus. It reached Rome, and was adopted by Cleomenes, and so has
continued to this day among his successors. Noetus asserts that there is one Father and God
of the universe, and that He made all things, and was imperceptible to those that exist when
He might so desire. Noetus maintained that the Father then appeared when He wished; and
He is invisible when He is not seen, but visible when He is seen. And this heretic also alleges
that the Father is unbegotten when He is not generated, but begotten when He is born of a
virgin; as also that He is not subject to suffering, and is immortal when He does not suffer
or die. When, however, His passion1056 came upon Him, Noetus allows that the Father
suffers and dies. And the Noetians suppose that this Father Himself is called Son, (and vice
versa,) in reference to the events which at their own proper periods happen to them severally.</p>
<p>Callistus corroborated the heresy of these Noetians, but we have already carefully explained
the details of his life. And Callistus himself produced likewise a heresy, and derived
its starting-points from these Noetians,—namely, so far as he acknowledges that there is
one Father and God, viz., the Creator of the universe, and that this (God) is spoken of, and
called by the name of Son, yet that in substance He is one Spirit. For Spirit, as the Deity, is,
he says, not any being different from the Logos, or the Logos from the Deity; therefore this
one person, (according to Callistus,) is divided nominally, but substantially not so. He supposes
this one Logos to be God, and affirms that there was in the case of the Word an incarnation.
And he is disposed (to maintain), that He who was seen in the flesh and was crucified1057
is Son, but that the Father it is who dwells in Him. Callistus thus at one time branches
off into the opinion of Noetus, but at another into that of Theodotus, and holds no sure
doctrine. These, then, are the opinions of Callistus.</p>

is traceable the beginning of an increase (of population) in Judea, which obtained its name
from Judah, fourth son of Jacob, whose name was also called Israel, from the fact that a race
of kings would be descended from him.1060 Abraham removes from Mesopotamia (when
75 years old, and) when 100 years old he begat Isaac. But Isaac, when 60 years of age, begat
Jacob. And Jacob, when 86 years old, begat Levi; and Levi, at 40 years of age, begat Caath;1061
and Caath was four years of age when he went down with Jacob into Egypt. Therefore the
entire period during which Abraham sojourned, and the entire family descended from him
by Isaac, in the country then called Canaanitis, was 215 years. But the father of this Abraham
is Thare,1062 and of this Thare the father is Nachor, and of this Nachor the father is Serag,
and of this Serag the father is Reu, and of this Reu the father is Peleg, and of this Peleg1063the
father is Heber. And so it comes to pass that the Jews are denominated by the name of
Hebrews. In the time of Phaleg,1064 however, arose the dispersion of nations. Now these nations
were 72,1065 corresponding with the number of Abraham’s children. And the names of these
nations we have likewise set down in other books, not even omitting this point in its own
proper place. And the reason of our particularity is our desire to manifest to those who are
of a studious disposition the love which we cherish towards the Divinity, and the indubitable

knowledge respecting the Truth, which in the course of our labours1066 we have acquired
possession of. But of this Heber the father is Salah; and of this Salah the father is Caïnan;
and of this Caïnan the father is Arphaxad, whose father is Shem; and of this Shem the father
is Noah. And in Noah’s time there occurred a flood throughout the entire world, which
neither Egyptians, nor Chaldeans, nor Greeks recollect; for the inundations which took
place in the age of Ogyges and Deucalion prevailed only in the localities where these
dwelt.1067 There are, then, in the case of these (patriarchs—that is, from Noah to Heber inclusive)—
5 generations, and 495 years.1068 This Noah, inasmuch as he was a most religious
and God-loving man, alone, with wife and children, and the three wives of these, escaped
the flood that ensued. And he owed his preservation to an ark; and both the dimensions
and relics of this ark are, as we have explained, shown to this day in the mountains called
Ararat, which are situated in the direction of the country of the Adiabeni.1069 It is then
possible for those who are disposed to investigate the subject industriously, to perceive how
clearly has been demonstrated the existence of a nation of worshippers of the true God, more
ancient than all the Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Greeks. What necessity, however, is there at
present to specify those who, anterior to Noah, were both devout men, and permitted to
hold converse with the true God, inasmuch as, so far as the subject taken in hand is concerned,
this testimony in regard of the antiquity of the people of God is sufficient?</p>

delivers himself above imply that he was the inventor of a chronological system, thus harmonizing with the fact
that the Paschal Cycle, though ever so faulty, was selected out of all his writings for being inscribed on Hippolytus’
statue, dug up on the road to Tivoli a.d. 1551, in the vicinity of Rome, near the Church of St. Lorenzo. [This

<p>But since it does not seem irrational to prove that these nations that had their attention
engrossed with the speculations of philosophy are of more modern date than those that had
habitually worshipped the true God,1070 it is reasonable that we should state both whence
the family of these latter originated; and that when they took up their abode in these countries,
they did not receive a name from the actual localities, but claimed for themselves names
from those who were primarily born, and had inhabited these. Noah had three sons—Shem,
Ham, and Japheth. From these the entire family of man was multiplied, and every quarter
of the earth owes its inhabitants in the first instance to these. For the word of God to them
prevailed, when the Lord said, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” So great
efficacy had that one word that from the three sons of Noah are begotten in the family 72
children,—(viz.,) from Shem, 25; from Japheth, 15; and from Ham, 32. Unto Ham, however,
these 32 children are born in accordance with previous declarations. And among Ham’s
children are: Canaan,1071 from whom came the Canaanites; Mizraim, from whom the
Egyptians; Cush, from whom the Ethiopians; and Phut, from whom the Libyans. These,
according to the language prevalent among them, are up to the present day styled by the
appellation of their ancestors; nay, even in the Greek tongue they are called by the names
by which they have been now denominated. But even supposing that neither these localities
had been previously inhabited, nor that it could be proved that a race of men from the beginning
existed there, nevertheless these sons of Noah, a worshipper of God, are quite sufficient
to prove the point at issue. For it is evident that Noah himself must have been a disciple
of devout people, for which reason he escaped the tremendous, though transient, threat of
water.</p>
<p>How, then, should not the worshippers of the true God be of greater antiquity than all
Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Greeks, for we must bear in mind that the father of these Gentiles
was born from this Japheth,1072 and received the name Javan, and became the progenitor
of Greeks and Ionians? Now, if the nations that devoted themselves to questions concerning
philosophy are shown to belong to a period altogether more recent than the race of the
worshippers of God as well as the time of the deluge, how would not the nations of the barbarians,
and as many tribes as in the world are known and unknown, appear to belong to a
more modern epoch than these? Therefore ye Greeks, Egyptians, Chaldeans, and the entire
race of men, become adepts in this doctrine, and learn from us, who are the friends of God,
what the nature of God is, and what His well-arranged creation. And we have cultivated

<p>The first and only (one God),1074 both Creator and Lord of all, had nothing coeval with
Himself; not infinite chaos, nor measureless water, nor solid earth, nor dense air, not warm
fire, nor refined spirit, nor the azure canopy1075 of the stupendous firmament. But He was
One, alone in Himself. By an exercise of His will He created things that are, which antecedently
had no existence, except that He willed to make them. For He is fully acquainted
with whatever is about to take place, for foreknowledge also is present to Him. The different
principles, however, of what will come into existence, He first fabricated, viz., fire and spirit,
water and earth, from which diverse elements He proceeded to form His own creation. And
some objects He formed of one essence, but others He compounded from two, and others
from three, and others from four. And those formed of one substance were immortal, for in
their case dissolution does not follow, for what is one will never be dissolved. Those, on the
other hand, which are formed out of two, or three, or four substances, are dissoluble;
wherefore also are they named mortal. For this has been denominated death; namely, the
dissolution of substances connected. I now therefore think that I have sufficiently answered
those endued with a sound mind, who, if they are desirous of additional instruction, and
are disposed accurately to investigate the substances of these things, and the causes of the
entire creation, will become acquainted with these points should they peruse a work of ours
comprised (under the title), Concerning the Substance of the Universe.1076 I consider, however,

of creed between Origen and the author of The Refutation. The fact, however, is that the doctrine of eternal

of the Universe was said to be written by Josephus, but discovers in marginal notes the ascription of it to Caius.
But Caius cannot be the writer, since Photius states that the author of The Labyrinth affirmed that he had written
On the Substance of the Universe. Now Hippolytus informs us that he is author of The Labyrinth. Hippolytus
thus refers to three of his works in The Refutation: (1) ἕτεραι βίβλοι, i.e., on Chronology; (2) Concerning the

<p>Therefore this solitary and supreme Deity, by an exercise of reflection, brought forth
the Logos first; not the word in the sense of being articulated by voice, but as a ratiocination
of the universe, conceived and residing in the divine mind. Him alone He produced from
existing things; for the Father Himself constituted existence, and the being born from Him
was the cause of all things that are produced.1077 The Logos was in the Father Himself,
bearing the will of His progenitor, and not being unacquainted with the mind of the Father.
For simultaneously1078 with His procession from His Progenitor, inasmuch as He is this
Progenitor’s first-born, He has, as a voice in Himself, the ideas conceived in the Father. And
so it was, that when the Father ordered the world to come into existence, the Logos one by
one completed each object of creation, thus pleasing God. And some things which multiply
by generation1079 He formed male and female; but whatsoever beings were designed for
service and ministration He made either male, or not requiring females, or neither male nor
female. For even the primary substances of these, which were formed out of nonentities,
viz., fire and spirit, water and earth, are neither male nor female; nor could male or female
proceed from any one of these, were it not that God, who is the source of all authority,
wished that the Logos might render assistance1080 in accomplishing a production of this kind.
I confess that angels are of fire, and I maintain that female spirits are not present with them.
And I am of opinion that sun and moon and stars, in like manner, are produced from fire
and spirit, and are neither male nor female. And the will of the Creator is, that swimming
and winged animals are from water, male and female. For so God, whose will it was, ordered
that there should exist a moist substance, endued with productive power. And in like manner
God commanded, that from earth should arise reptiles and beasts, as well males and females
of all sorts of animals; for so the nature of the things produced admitted. For as many things
as He willed, God made from time to time. These things He created through the Logos, it
not being possible for things to be generated otherwise than as they were produced. But
when, according as He willed, He also formed (objects), He called them by names, and thus
notified His creative effort.1081 And making these, He formed the ruler of all, and fashioned

him out of all composite substances.1082 The Creator did not wish to make him a god, and
failed in His aim; nor an angel,—be not deceived,—but a man. For if He had willed to make
thee a god, He could have done so. Thou hast the example of the Logos. His will, however,
was, that you should be a man, and He has made thee a man. But if thou art desirous of also
becoming a god, obey Him that has created thee, and resist not now, in order that, being
found faithful in that which is small, you may be enabled to have entrusted to you also that
which is great.1083</p>
<p>The Logos alone of this God is from God himself; wherefore also the Logos is God, being
the substance of God.1084 Now the world was made from nothing; wherefore it is not God;
as also because this world admits of dissolution whenever the Creator so wishes it. But God,
who created it, did not, nor does not, make evil. He makes what is glorious and excellent;
for He who makes it is good. Now man, that was brought into existence, was a creature endued
with a capacity of self-determination,1085 yet not possessing a sovereign intellect,1086
nor holding sway over all things by reflection, and authority, and power, but a slave to his
passions, and comprising all sorts of contrarieties in himself. But man, from the fact of his
possessing a capacity of self-determination, brings forth what is evil,1087 that is, accidentally;
which evil is not consummated except you actually commit some piece of wickedness. For
it is in regard of our desiring anything that is wicked, or our meditating upon it, that what
is evil is so denominated. Evil had no existence from the beginning, but came into being
subsequently.1088 Since man has free will, a law has been defined for his guidance by the
Deity, not without answering a good purpose. For if man did not possess the power to will

and not to will, why should a law be established? For a law will not be laid down for an animal
devoid of reason, but a bridle and a whip;1089 whereas to man has been given a precept
and penalty to perform, or for not carrying into execution what has been enjoined. For man
thus constituted has a law been enacted by just men in primitive ages. Nearer our own day
was there established a law, full of gravity and justice, by Moses, to whom allusion has been
already made, a devout man, and one beloved of God.</p>
<p>Now the Logos of God controls all these; the first begotten Child of the Father, the voice
of the Dawn antecedent to the Morning Star.1090 Afterwards just men were born, friends
of God; and these have been styled prophets,1091 on account of their foreshowing future
events. And the word of prophecy1092 was committed unto them, not for one age only; but
also the utterances of events predicted throughout all generations, were vouchsafed in perfect
clearness. And this, too, not at the time merely when seers furnished a reply to those
present;1093 but also events that would happen throughout all ages, have been manifested
beforehand; because, in speaking of incidents gone by, the prophets brought them back to
the recollection of humanity; whereas, in showing forth present occurrences, they endeavoured
to persuade men not to be remiss; while, by foretelling future events, they have
rendered each one of us terrified on beholding events that had been predicted long before,
and on expecting likewise those events predicted as still future. Such is our faith, O all ye
men,—ours, I say, who are not persuaded by empty expressions, nor caught away by sudden
impulses of the heart, nor beguiled by the plausibility of eloquent discourses, yet who do
not refuse to obey words that have been uttered by divine power. And these injunctions has
God given to the Word. But the Word, by declaring them, promulgated the divine commandments,
thereby turning man from disobedience, not bringing him into servitude by force
of necessity, but summoning him to liberty through a choice involving spontaneity.</p>
<p>This Logos the Father in the latter days sent forth, no longer to speak by a prophet, and
not wishing that the Word, being obscurely proclaimed, should be made the subject of mere
conjecture, but that He should be manifested, so that we could see Him with our own eyes.

This Logos, I say, the Father sent forth, in order that the world, on beholding Him, might
reverence Him who was delivering precepts not by the person of prophets, nor terrifying
the soul by an angel, but who was Himself—He that had spoken—corporally present amongst
us. This Logos we know to have received a body from a virgin, and to have remodelled the
old man1094 by a new creation. And we believe the Logos to have passed through every
period in this life, in order that He Himself might serve as a law for every age,1095 and that,
by being present (amongst) us, He might exhibit His own manhood as an aim for all men.
And that by Himself in person He might prove that God made nothing evil, and that man
possesses the capacity of self-determination, inasmuch as he is able to will and not to will,
and is endued with power to do both.1096 This Man we know to have been made out of the
compound of our humanity. For if He were not of the same nature with ourselves, in vain
does He ordain that we should imitate the Teacher. For if that Man happened to be of a
different substance from us, why does He lay injunctions similar to those He has received on
myself, who am born weak; and how is this the act of one that is good and just? In order,
however, that He might not be supposed to be different from us, He even underwent toil,
and was willing to endure hunger, and did not refuse to feel thirst, and sunk into the quietude
of slumber. He did not protest against His Passion, but became obedient unto death, and
manifested His resurrection. Now in all these acts He offered up, as the first-fruits, His own
manhood, in order that thou, when thou art in tribulation, mayest not be disheartened, but,
confessing thyself to be a man (of like nature with the Redeemer), mayest dwell in expectation
of also receiving what the Father has granted unto this Son.1097</p>

sufferings thou didst undergo while being a man, these He gave to thee, because thou wast
of mortal mould, but whatever it is consistent with God to impart, these God has promised

This constitutes the import of the proverb, “Know thyself;” i.e., discover God within thyself,
for He has formed thee after His own image. For with the knowledge of self is conjoined the
being an object of God’s knowledge, for thou art called by the Deity Himself. Be not therefore
inflamed, O ye men, with enmity one towards another, nor hesitate to retrace1105 with all
speed your steps. For Christ is the God above all, and He has arranged to wash away sin
from human beings,1106 rendering regenerate the old man. And God called man His likeness
from the beginning, and has evinced in a figure His love towards thee. And provided thou
obeyest His solemn injunctions, and becomest a faithful follower of Him who is good, thou
shalt resemble Him, inasmuch as thou shalt have honour conferred upon thee by Him. For
the Deity, (by condescension,) does not diminish aught of the divinity of His divine1107

<p>I.
(Who first propounded these heresies, p. 11.)</p>
<p>Hippolytus seems to me to have felt the perils to the pure Gospel of many admissions
made by Clement and other Alexandrian doctors as to the merits of some of the philosophers
of the Gentiles. Very gently, but with prescient genius, he adopts this plan of tracing the
origin and all the force of heresies to “philosophy falsely so called.” The existence of this
“cloud of locusts” is (1) evidence of the antagonism of Satan; (2) of the prophetic spirit of
the apostles; (3) of the tremendous ferment produced by the Gospel leaven as soon as it was
hid in the “three measures of meal” by “the Elect Lady,” the Ecclesia Dei; (4) of the fidelity
of the witnesses,—that grand, heroic glory of the Ante-Nicene Fathers,—who never suffered
these heresies to be mistaken for the faith, or to corrupt the Scriptures; and (5) finally of the
power of the Holy Spirit, who gave them victory over errors, and enabled them to define
truth in all the crystalline beauty of that “Mountain of Light,” that true Koh-i-noor, the
Nicene Symbol. Thus, also, Christ’s promises were fulfilled.</p>

barbares aux princes et aux puissances qu’ils mettaient en chaque ciel. Ils en nommaient un
caulaucauch, abusant d’un passage d’Isaie, où se lisent ces mots hebreux: cau-la-cau, caula-
cau, pour representer l’insolence avec laquelle les impies se moquaient du prophète, en
répétant plusieurs fois quelques-unes de ses paroles.” Compare Guerricus, thus: “Vox illa
tædii et desperationis, quæ apud Isaiam (xxviii. 13) legitur, quia, viz., moram faciente
Domino, frequentibus nuntiis ejus increduli et illusores insultare videntur: manda remanda,”

<p>III.
(The Phrygians call Papa, p. 54.)</p>
<p>Hippolytus had little idea, when he wrote this, what the word Papa was destined to
signify in mediæval Rome. The Abba of Holy Writ has its equivalent in many Oriental languages,
as well as in the Greek and Latin, through which it has passed into all the dialects
of Europe. It was originally given to all presbyters, as implied in their name of elders, and
was a title of humility when it became peculiar to the bishops, as (1 Pet. v. 3) non Domini
sed patres. St. Paul (1 Cor. iv. 15) shows that “in Christ”—that is, under Him—we may have
such “fathers;” and thus, while he indicates the true sense of the precept, he leads us to recognise
a prophetic force and admonition in our Saviour’s words (Matt. xxiii.), “Call no man
your father upon the earth.” Thus interpreted, these words seem to be a warning against
the sense to which this name, Papa, became, long afterwards, restricted, in Western Europe:
Notre St. Père, le Pape, as they say in France. This was done by the decree of the ambitious
Hildebrand, Gregory VII. (who died a.d. 1085), when, in a synod held at Rome, he defined
that “the title Pope should be peculiar to one only in the Christian world.” The Easterns, of
course, never paid any respect to this novelty and dictation, and to this day their patriarchs
are popes; and not only so, for the parish priests of the Greek churches are called by the
same name. I was once cordially invited to take a repast “with the pope,” on visiting a Greek
church on the shores of the Adriatic. It is said, however, that a distinction is made between
the words πάπας and παπᾶς; the latter being peculiar to inferiors, according to the refinements
of Goar, a Western critic. Valeat quantum. But I must here note, that as “words are things,”
and as infinite damage has been done to history and to Christian truth by tolerating this
empiricism of Rome, I have restored scientific accuracy, in this series, whenever reference
is made to the primitive bishops of Rome, who were no more “Popes” than Cincinnatus
was an emperor. It is time that theological science should accept, like other sciences, the
language of truth and the terminology of demonstrated fact. The early bishops of Rome
were geographically important, and were honoured as sitting in the only apostolic see of
the West; but they were almost inconsiderable in the structural work of the ante-Nicene
ages, and have left no appreciable impress on its theology. After the Council of Nice they
were recognised as patriarchs, though equals among brethren, and nothing more. The ambition
of Boniface III. led him to name himself “universal bishop.” This was at first a mere
name “of intolerable pride,” as his predecessor Gregory had called it, but Nicholas I. (a.d.
858) tried to make it real, and, by means of the false decretals, created himself the first “Pope”
in the modern sense, imposing his despotism on the West, and identifying it with the polity
of Western churches, which alone submitted to it. Thus, it was never Catholic, and came
into existence only by nullifying the Nicene Constitutions, and breaking away from Catholic
communion with the parent churches of the East. Compare Casaubon (Exercit., xiv. p. 280,

<pb n="402"/>
etc.) in his comments on Baronius. I have thus stated with scientific precision what all candid
critics and historians, even the Gallicans included, enable us to prove. Why, then, keep up
the language of fiction and imposture,1110 so confusing to young students? I believe the
youthful Oxonians whom our modern Tertullian carried with him into the papal schism,
could never have been made dupes but for the persistent empiricism of orthodox writers
who practically adopt in words what they refute in argument, calling all bishops of Rome
“Popes,” and even including St. Peter’s blessed name in this fallacious designation.1111 In
this series I adhere to the logic of facts, calling (1) all the bishops of Rome from Linus to
Sylvester simply bishops; and (2) all their successors to Nicholas I. “patriarchs” under the
Nicene Constitutions, which they professed to honour, though, after Gregory the Great, they
were ever vying with Constantinople to make themselves greater. (3) Nicholas, who trampled
on the Nicene Constitutions, and made the false decretals the canon law of the Western
churches, was therefore the first “Pope” who answers to the Tridentine definitions. Even
these, however, were never able to make dogmatic1112 the claim of “supremacy,” which was
first done by Pius IX. in our days. A canonical Primacy is one thing: a self-asserted Supremacy
is quite another, as the French doctors have abundantly demonstrated.</p>

<p>IV.
(Contemporaneous heresy, p. 125.)</p>
<p>Here begins that “duplicating of our knowledge” of primitive Rome of which Bunsen
speaks so justly. A thorough mastery of this book will prepare us to understand the great
Cyprian in all his relations with the Roman Province, and not less to comprehend the affairs
of Novatian.</p>
<p>Bunsen, with all respect, does not comprehend the primitive system, and reads it backward,
from the modern system, which travesties antiquity even in its apparent conformities.
These conformities are only the borrowing of old names for new contrivances. Thus, he
reads the cardinals of the eleventh century into the simple presbytery of comprovincial

emperors?</note>
<note type="footnote">1111 How St. Peter would regard it, see 1 Pet. v. 1–3. I am sorry to find Dr. Schaff, in his useful compilation,
History of the Christian Church, vol. ii. p 166, dropping into the old ruts of fable, after sufficiently proving just
before, what I have maintained. He speaks of “the insignificance of the first Popes,”—meaning the early Bishops
of Rome, men who minded their own business, but could not have been “insignificant” had they even imagined
themselves “Popes.”</note>

bishops of the third century,1113 just as he elsewhere lugs in the Ave Maria of modern Italy
to expound the Evening Hymn to the Trinity.1114 In a professed Romanist, like De Maistre,
this would be resented as jugglery. But let us come to facts. Bunsen’s preliminary remarks1115
are excellent. But when he comes to note an “exceptional system” in the Roman “presbytery,”
he certainly confuses all things. Let us recur to Tertullian.1116 See how much was already
established in his day, which the Council of Nicæa recognised a century later as (τὰ ἀρχαῖα
ἔθη) old primitive institutions. In all things the Greek churches were the exemplar and the
model for other churches to follow. “Throughout the provinces of Greece,” he says, “there
are held, in definite localities, those councils,” etc. “If we also, in our diverse provinces, observe,”
etc. Now, these councils, or “meetings,” in spite of the emperors or the senate who
issued mandates against them, as appears from the same passage, were, in the Roman
Province, made up of the comprovincial bishops: and their gatherings seem to have been
called “the Roman presbytery;” for, as is evident, the bishops and elders were alike called
“presbyters,” the word being as common to both orders as the word pastors or clergymen
in our days. According to the thirty-fourth of the “Canons Apostolical,” as Bunsen remarks,
“the bishops of the suburban towns, including Portus, also formed at that time an integral
part of the Roman presbytery.” This word also refers to all the presbyters of the diocese of
Rome itself; and I doubt not originally the laity had their place, as they did in Carthage:
“the apostles, elders, and brethren” being the formula of Scripture; or, “with the whole
Church,” which includes them,—omni plebe adstante.1117 Now, all this accounts, as Bunsen
justly observes, for the fact that one of the “presbytery” should be thus repeatedly called
presbyter and “at the same time have the charge of the church at Portus, for which (office)
there was no other title than the old one of bishop; for such was the title of every man who
presided over the congregation in any city,—at Ostia, at Tusculum, or in the other suburban
cities.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the thirty-fourth1118 “Apostolical Canon” (so called), and note as
follows: “It is necessary that the bishops of every nation should know who is chief among
them, and should recognise him as their head by doing nothing of great moment without
his consent; and that each of them should do such things only as pertain to his own parish
and the districts under him. And neither let him do any thing without the consent of all, for
thus shall there be unity of heart, and thus shall God be glorified through our Lord Jesus

Christ.” I do not pause to expound this word parish, for I am elucidating Hippolytus by
Bunsen’s aid, and do not intend to interpolate my own theory of the primitive episcopate.</p>
<p>Let the “Apostolical Constitutions” go for what they are worth:1119 I refer to them only
under lead of Dr. Bunsen. But now turn to the Nicene Council (Canon VI.) as follows: “Let
the ancient customs prevail in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis, so that the Bishop of Alexandria
have jurisdiction in all these provinces, since the like is customary in Rome also. Likewise in
Antioch and the other provinces, let the churches retain their privileges.” Here the Province
of Rome is recognised as an ancient institution, while its jurisdiction and privileges are
equalized with those of other churches. Now, Rufinus, interpreting this canon, says it means,
“the ancient custom of Alexandria and Rome shall still be observed; that the one shall have
the care or government of the Egyptian, and the other that of the suburbicary churches.”
Bunsen refers us to Bingham, and from him we learn that the suburbicary region, as known
to the Roman magistrates, included only “a hundred miles about Rome.”1120 This seems to
have been canonically extended even to Sicily on the south, but certainly not to Milan on
the north. Suffice it, Hippolytus was one of those suburbicarian bishops who sat in the Provincial
Council of Rome; without consent of which the Bishop of Rome could not, canonically,
do anything of importance, as the canon above cited ordains. Such are the facts necessary
to a comprehension of conflicts excited by “the contemporaneous heresy,” here noted.</p>

<p>V.
(Affairs of the Church, p. 125.)</p>
<p>“Zephyrinus imagines that he administers the affairs of the Church—an uninformed
and shamefully corrupt man.” This word imagines is common with Hippolytus in like cases,
and Dr. Wordsworth gives an ingenious explanation of this usage. But it seems to me to be
based upon the relations of Hippolytus as one of the synod or “presbytery,” without consent
of which the bishop could do nothing important. Zephyrinus, on the contrary, imagined
himself competent to decide as to the orthodoxy of a tenet or of a teacher, without his
comprovincials. This, too, relieves our author from the charge of egotism when he exults in
the defeat of such a bishop.1121 He says, it is true, “Callistus threw off Sabellius through fear
of me,” and we may readily believe that; but he certainly means to give honour to others in
the Province when he says, “We resisted Zephyrinus and Callistus;” “We nearly converted
Sabellius;” “All were carried away by the hypocrisy of Callistus, except ourselves.” This man
cried out to his episcopal brethren, “Ye are Ditheists,” apparently in open council. His

<pb n="405"/>
council prevailed over him by the wise leadership of Hippolytus, however; and he says of
the two guilty bishops, “Never, at any time, have we been guilty of collusion with them.” They
only imagined, therefore, that they were managing the “affairs of the Church.” The fidelity
of their comprovincials preserved the faith of the Apostles in apostolic Rome.</p>

<p>VI.
(We offered them opposition, p. 125.)</p>
<p>Here we see that Hippolytus had no idea of the sense some put upon the convenire of
his master Irenæus.1122 It was not “necessary” for them to conform their doctrines to that
of the Bishop of Rome, evidently; nor to “the Church of Rome” as represented by him. To
the church which presided over a province, indeed, recourse was to be had by all belonging
to that province; but it is our author’s grateful testimony, that to the council of comprovincials,
and not to any one bishop therein, Rome owed its own adhesion to orthodoxy at this crisis.</p>
<p>All this illustrates the position of Tertullian, who never thinks of ascribing to Rome any
other jurisdiction than that belonging to other provinces. As seats of testimony, the
apostolic sees, indeed, are all to be honoured. “In Greece, go to Corinth; in Asia Minor, to
Ephesus; if you are adjacent to Italy, you have Rome; whence also (an apostolic) authority
is at hand for us in Africa.” Such is his view of “contemporaneous affairs.”</p>

<p>VII.
(Heraclitus the Obscure, p. 126.)</p>
<p>“Well might he weep,” says Tayler Lewis, “as Lucian represents him, over his overflowing
universe of perishing phenomena, where nothing stood;…nothing was fixed, but, as in a
mixture, all things were confounded.” He was “the weeping philosopher.”</p>
<p>Here let me add Henry Nelson Coleridge’s remarks on the Greek seed-plot of those
philosophies which were begotten of the Egyptian mysteries, and which our author regards
as, in turn, engendering “all heresies,” when once their leaders felt, like Simon Magus, a
power in the Gospel of which they were jealous, and of which they wished to make use
without submitting to its yoke. “Bishop Warburton,” says Henry Nelson Coleridge, “discovered,
perhaps, more ingenuity than sound judgment in his views of the nature of the
Greek mysteries; entertaining a general opinion that their ultimate object was to teach the
initiated a pure theism, and to inculcate the certainty and the importance of a future state
of rewards and punishments. I am led by the arguments of Villoison and Ste. Croix to doubt
<note type="footnote">1122 See vol. i. pp. 415, 460, this series.</note>

<pb n="406"/>
the accuracy of this.” In short, he supposes a “pure pantheism,” or Spinosism, the substance
of their teaching.1123</p>

<p>VIII.
(Imagine themselves to be disciples of Christ, p. 126.)</p>
<p>This and the foregoing chapter offer us a most overwhelming testimony to the independence
of councils. In the late “Council of Sacristans” at the Vatican, where truth perished,
Pius IX. refused to all the bishops of what he accounted “the Catholic universe” what the
seven suburbicarian bishops were able to enforce as a right, in the primitive age, against two
successive Bishops of Rome, who were patrons of heresy. These heretical prelates persisted;
but the Province remained in communion with the other apostolic provinces, while rejecting
all communion with them. All this will help us in studying Cyprian’s treatise On Unity, and
it justifies his own conduct.</p>

<p>IX.
(The episcopal throne, p. 128.)</p>
<p>The simple primitive cathedra,1124 of which we may learn something from the statue
of Hippolytus, was, no doubt, “a throne” in the eyes of an ambitious man. Callistus is here
charged, by one who knew him and his history, with obtaining this position by knavish
words and practices. The question may well arise, in our Christian love for antiquity, How
could such things be, even in the age of martyrdoms? Let us recollect, that under the good
Bishop Pius, when his brother wrote the Hermas, the peril of wealth and love of money
began to be imminent at Rome. Tertullian testifies to the lax discipline of that see when he
was there. Minucius Felix lets us into the impressions made by the Roman Christians upon
surrounding heathen: they were a set of conies burrowing in the earth; a “light-shunning
people,” lurking in the catacombs. And yet, while this fact shows plainly that good men
were not ambitious to come forth from these places of exile and suffering, and expose
themselves needlessly to death, it leads us to comprehend how ambitious men, studiosi novarum
rerum, could remain above ground, conforming very little to the discipline of Christ,
making friends with the world, and yet using their nominal religion on the principle that
“gain is godliness.” There were some wealthy Christians; there were others, like Marcia in
the palace, sufficiently awakened to perceive their own wickedness, and anxious to do favours
to the persecuted flock, by way, perhaps, of compounding for sins not renounced. And

<note type="footnote">1124 See vol. ii. p. 12, also iv. 210.</note>

<pb n="407"/>
when we come to the Epistles of Cyprian,1125 we shall see what opportunities were given
to desperate men to make themselves a sort of brokers to the Christian community; for
selfish ends helping them in times of peril, and rendering themselves, to the less conscientious,
a medium for keeping on good terms with the magistrates. Such a character was Callistus,
one of “the grievous wolves” foreseen by St. Paul when he exhorted his brethren night
and day, with tears, to beware of them. How he made himself Bishop of Rome, the holy
Hippolytus sufficiently explains.</p>

<p>X.
(Unskilled in ecclesiastical definitions, p. 128.)</p>
<p>It has been sufficiently demonstrated by the learned Döllinger, than whom a more
competent and qualified witness could not be named, that the late pontiff, Pius IX., was in
this respect, as a bishop, very much like Callistus. Moreover, his chief adviser and prime
minister, Antonelli, was notoriously Callistus over again; standing towards him in the same
relations which Callistus bore to Zephyrinus. Yet, by the bull Ineffabilis, that pontiff has
retrospectively clothed the definitions of Zephyrinus and Callistus with infallibility; thus
making himself also a partaker in their heresies, and exposing himself to the anathemas
with which the Catholic councils overwhelmed his predecessor Honorius and others. That
at such a crisis the testimony of Hippolytus should come to light, and supply a reductio ad
absurdum to the late papal definitions, may well excite such a recognition of divine
providence as Dr. Bunsen repeatedly suggests.</p>

<p>XI.
(All consented—we did not, p. 128.)</p>
<p>The Edinburgh editor supposes that the use of the plural we, in this place, is the official
plural of a bishop. It has been already explained, however, that he is speaking of the provincial
bishops with whom he withstood Callistus when the plebs were carried away by his hypocrisy.
In England, bishops in certain cases, are a “corporation sole;” and, as such, the plural is
legal phraseology. All bishops, however, use the plural in certain documents, as identifying
themselves with the universal episcopate, on the Cyprianic principle—Episcopatus unus est,
etc.</p>
<p>In Acts v. 13 is a passage which may be somewhat explained, perhaps, by this: “All
consented…we did not.” The plebs joined themselves to the apostles; “but of the rest durst
no man join himself to them: howbeit, the plebs magnified them, and believers were added,”
<note type="footnote">1125 See Treatise on the Lapsed, infra.</note>

<pb n="408"/>
etc. “The rest” (τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν) here means the priests, the Pharisees, and Sadducees, the
classes who were not the plebs, as appears by what immediately follows.1126</p>

<p>XII.
(Our condemnatory sentence, p. 131.)</p>
<p>Again: Hippolytus refers to the action of the suburbicarian bishops in provincial council.
And here is the place to express dissatisfaction with the apologetic tone of some writers,
who seem to think Hippolytus too severe, etc. As if, in dealing with such “wolves in sheep’s
clothing,” this faithful leader could show himself a true shepherd without emphasis and
words of abhorrence. Hippolytus has left to the Church the impress of his character1127 as
“superlatively sweet and amiable.” Such was St. John, the beloved disciple; but he was not
less a “son of thunder.” Our Divine Master was “the Lamb,” and “the Lion;” the author of
the Beatitudes, and the author of those terrific woes; the “meek and gentle friend of publicans
and sinners,” and the “lash of small cords” upon the backs of those who made His Father’s
house a “den of thieves.” Such was Chrysostom, such was Athanasius, such was St. Paul,
and such have ever been the noblest of mankind; tender and considerate, gentle and full of
compassion; but not less resolute, in the crises of history, in withstanding iniquity in the
persons of arch-enemies of truth, and setting the brand upon their foreheads. Good men,
who hate strife, and love study and quiet, and to be friendly with others; men who never
permit themselves to indulge a personal enmity, or to resent a personal affront; men who
forgive injuries to the last farthing when they only are concerned,—may yet crucify their
natures in withstanding evil when they are protecting Christ’s flock, or fulfilling the command
to “contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.” What the Christian Church
owes to the loving spirit of Hippolytus in the awful emergencies of his times, protecting the
poor sheep, and grappling with wolves for their sake, the Last Day will fully declare. But let
us who know nothing of such warfare concede nothing, in judging of his spirit, to the spirit
of our unbelieving age, which has no censures except for the defenders of truth:—
<lg>
<l>“Eternal smiles its emptiness betray,</l>
<l>As shallow streams run dimpling all the way.”</l>

but then gives Christ over to be crucified, must be treated with especial favour. Christ is
good: so is Pilate; and Judas must not be censured. My soul be with Hippolytus when the
great Judge holds his assize. His eulogy is in the psalm:1128 “Then stood up Phinehas, and
executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. And that was counted unto him for
righteousness unto all generations, for evermore.”</p>

<p>XIII.
(As if he had not sinned, p. 131.)</p>
<p>There is an ambiguity in the facts as given in the Edinburgh edition, of which it is hard
to relieve the text. The word καθίστασθαι is rendered to retain (their places) in the first instance,
as if the case were all one with the second instance, where μένειν is justly rendered
to continue. The second case seems, then, to cover all the ground. What need to speak of
men “twice or thrice married,” if a man once married, after ordination is not to be retained?
The word retained is questionable in the first instance; and I have adopted Wordsworth’s
reading, to be enrolled, which is doubtless the sense.</p>
<p>This statement of our author lends apparent countenance to the antiquity of the
“Apostolic Constitutions,” so called. Perhaps Hippolytus really supposed them to be
apostolic. By Canon XVII. of that collection, a man twice married, after baptism cannot be
“on the sacerdotal list at all.” By Canon XXVI., an unmarried person once admitted to the
clergy cannot be permitted to marry. These are the two cases referred to by our author. In
the Greek churches this rule holds to this day; and the Council of Nice refused to prohibit
the married clergy to live in that holy estate, while allowing the traditional discipline which
Hippolytus had in view in speaking of a violation of the twenty-sixth traditional canon as
a sin. As Bingham has remarked, however, canons of discipline may be relaxed when not
resting on fundamental and scriptural laws.</p>

<p>XIV.
(Attempt to call themselves a Catholic Church, p. 131.)</p>
<p>The Callistians, it seems, became a heretical sect, and yet presumed to call themselves
a “Catholic Church.” Yet this sect, while Callistus lived, was in full communion with the
Bishop of Rome. Such communion, then, was no test of Catholicity. Observe the enormous
crimes of which this lawless one was guilty; he seems to antedate the age of Theodora’s popes
and Marozia’s, and what Hippolytus would have said of them is not doubtful. It is remarkable
that he employed St. Paul’s expression, however, ὁ ἄνομος,1129 “that wicked” or that “lawless

one,” seeing, in such a bishop, what St. Gregory did in another,—“a forerunner of the Antichrist.”</p>

<p>XV.
(Callistians, p. 131.)</p>
<p>Bunsen remarks that Theodoret speaks of this sect1130 under the head of the “Noetians.”
Wordsworth quotes as follows: “Callistus took the lead in propagating this heresy after
Noetus, and devised certain additions to the impiety of the doctrine.” In other words, he
was not merely a heretic, but himself a heresiarch. He gives the whole passage textually,1131
and institutes interesting parallelisms between the Philosophumena and Theodoret, who
used our author, and boldly borrowed from him.</p>

<p>XVI.
(The cause of all things, p. 150.)</p>
<p>When one looks at the infinite variety of opinions, phrases, ideas, and the like, with
which the heresies of three centuries threatened to obscure, defile, and destroy the revelations
of Holy Scripture, who can but wonder at the miracle of orthodoxy? Note with what fidelity
the good fight of faith was maintained, the depositum preserved, and the Gospel epitomized
at last in the Nicæno-Constantinopolitan definitions, which Professor Shedd, as I have
previously noted, declares to be the accepted confession of all the reformed, reputed orthodox,
as well as of Greeks and Latins. Let us not be surprised, that, during these conflicts, truth
on such mysterious subjects was reflected from good men’s minds with slight variations of
expression. Rather behold the miracle of their essential agreement, and of their entire harmony
in the Great Symbol, universally accepted as the testimony of the ante-Nicene witnesses.
The Word was Himself the cause of all created things; Himself increate; His eternal generation
implied in the eternity of His existence and His distinct personality.</p>

<p>XVII.
(Tartarus, p. 153.)</p>
<p>I am a little surprised at the innocent statement of the learned translator, that “Dr.
Wordsworth justifies Hippolytus’ use of this word.” It must have occurred to every student
of the Greek Testament that St. Peter justifies this use in the passage quoted by Wordsworth,
which one would think must be self-suggested to any theologian reading our author’s text.

In short, Hippolytus quotes the second Epistle of St. Peter1132 (ii. 4) when he uses this otherwise
startling word. Josephus also employs it;1133 it was familiar to the Jews, and the
apostle had no scruple in adopting a word which proves the Gentile world acquainted with
a Gehenna as well as a Sheol.</p>

<p>XVIII.
(For Christ is the God, p. 153.)</p>
<p>Dr. Wordsworth justly censures Bunsen for his rendering of this passage,1134 also for
manufacturing for Hippolytus a “Confession of Faith” out of his tenth book.1135 I must
refer the student to that all-important chapter in Dr. Wordsworth’s work (cap. xi.) on the
“Development of Christian Doctrine.” It is masterly, as against Dr. Newman, as well; and
the respectful justice which he renders at the same time to Dr. Bunsen is worthy of all admiration.
Let it be noted, that, while one must be surprised by the ready command of literary
and theological materials which the learned doctor and chevalier brings into instantaneous
use for his work, it is hardly less surprising, in spite of all that, that he was willing to throw
off his theories and strictures, without any delay, during the confusions of that memorable
year 1851, when I had the honour of meeting him among London notabilities. He says to
his “dearest friend, Archdeacon Hare,…Dr. Tregelles informed me last week of the appearance
of the work (of Hippolytus)…I procured a copy in consequence, and perused it as soon
as I could; and I have already arrived at conclusions which seem to me so evident that I feel
no hesitation in expressing them to you at once.” These conclusions were creditable to his
acumen and learning in general; eminently so. But the theories he had so hastily conceived,
in other particulars, crop out in so many crudities of theological caprice, that nobody should
try to study his theoretical opinions without the aid of that calm reviewal they have received
from Dr. Wordsworth’s ripe and sober scholarship and well-balanced intellect.</p>

<head>General Note.</head>
<p>I avail myself of a little spare space to add, from Michelet’s friend, E. Quinet,1136 the
passage to which I have made a reference on p. 156. Let me say, however, that Quinet and
Michelet are specimens of that intellectual revolt against Roman dogma which is all but
universal in Europe in our day, and of which the history of M. Renan is a melancholy exposition.
To Quinet, with all his faults, belongs the credit of having more thoroughly understood
than any theological writer the absolute revolution created by the Council of Trent; and he
justly remarks that the Jesuits showed their address “in making this revolution, without
anywhere speaking of it.” Hence a dull world has not observed it. Contrasting this pseudocouncil
with the free councils of antiquity, M. Quinet says: “The Council of Trent has not
its roots in all nations; it does not assemble about it the representatives of all nations…omni
plebe adstante, according to the ancient formula…The East and the North are, almost equally,
wanting; and this is why the king of France refused it the title of a council.” He quotes noble
passages from Bossuet.1137</p>

<p>On the Hexaëmeron,1138 Or Six Days’ Work.</p>
<p>Now these things we are under the necessity of setting forth at length, in order to disprove
the supposition of others. For some choose to maintain that paradise is in heaven, and forms
no part of the system of creation. But since we see with our eyes the rivers that go forth from
it which are open, indeed, even in our day, to the inspection of any who choose, let every
one conclude from this that it did not belong to heaven, but was in reality planted in the
created system. And, in truth, it is a locality in the east, and a place select.</p>
<note type="footnote">1138 In John Damasc., Sacr. Parall., Works, ii. p. 787. That Hippolytus wrote on the Hexaëmeron is noticed

<p>On Genesis.1139</p>
<p>Gen. i. 5 And it was evening, and it was morning, one day.</p>
<p>Hippolytus. He did not say1140 “night and day,” but “one day,” with reference to the
name of the light. He did not say the “first day;” for if he had said the “first” day, he would
also have had to say that the “second” day was made. But it was right to speak not of the
“first day,” but of “one day,” in order that by saying “one,” he might show that it returns on
its orbit and, while it remains one, makes up the week.</p>
<p>Gen. i. 6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water.</p>
<p>Hipp. On the first day God made what He made out of nothing. But on the other days
He did not make out of nothing, but out of what He had made on the first day, by moulding
it according to His pleasure.</p>
<p>Gen. i. 6, 7. And let it divide between water and water: and it was so. And God made
the firmament; and God divided between the water which was under the firmament, and
the water above the firmament: and it was so.</p>
<p>Hipp. As the excessive volume of water bore along over the face of the earth, the earth
was by reason thereof “invisible” and “formless.” When the Lord of all designed to make
the invisible visible, He fixed then a third part of the waters in the midst; and another third
part He set by itself on high, raising it together with the firmament by His own power; and
the remaining third He left beneath, for the use and benefit of men. Now at1141 this point
we have an asterisk. The words are found in the Hebrew, but do not occur in the Septuagint.</p>
<p>Gen. iii. 8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden at even.</p>
<p>Hipp. Rather they discerned the approach of the Lord by a certain breeze. As soon,
therefore, as they had sinned, God appeared to them, producing consciousness of their sin,
and calling them to repentance.</p>
<p>Gen. xlix. 3 Reuben, my first-born, thou art my strength, and the first of my children;
hard to bear with, and hard and self-willed: thou hast waxed wanton as water; boil not
over.1142</p>
<note type="footnote">1139 These fragments are excerpts from a Commentary on Genesis, compiled from eighty-eight fathers, which
is extant in manuscript in the Vienna library. They are found also in a Catena on Matthew, issued at Leipsic in
1772.</note>

<p>Aquila. Reuben, my first-born, thou art my strength, and the sum of my sorrow: excelling
in dignity and excelling in might: thou hast been insensate as water; excel not.1143</p>
<p>Symmachus. Reuben, my first-born, and beginning of my1144 pain: above measure
grasping, and above measure hot as water, thou shalt not more excel.1145</p>
<p>Hipp. For there was a great display of strength made by God in behalf of His first-born
people from Egypt. For in very many ways was the land of the Egyptians chastised. That
first people of the circumcision is meant by “my strength, and the first of my children:”
even as God gave the promise to Abraham and to his seed. But “hard to bear with,” because
the people hardened itself against the obedience of God. And “hard, self-willed,” because it
was not only hard against the obedience of God, but also self-willed so as to set upon the
Lord. “Thou hast waxed wanton,” because in the instance of our Lord Jesus Christ the
people waxed wanton against the Father. But “boil not over,” says the Spirit, by way of
comfort, that it might not, by boiling utterly over, be spilt abroad,—giving it hope of salvation.
For what has boiled over and been spilt is lost.</p>
<p>Gen. xlix. 4 For thou wentest up to thy father’s bed.</p>
<p>Hipp. First he mentions the event,—that in the last days the people will assault the bed
of the Father, that is, the bride,1146 the Church, with intent to corrupt her; which thing, indeed,
it does even at this present day, assaulting her by blasphemies.</p>
<p>Gen. xlix. 5. Simeon and Levi, brethren.</p>
<p>Hipp. Since from Simeon sprang the scribes, and from Levi the priests. For the scribes
and priests fulfilled iniquity1147 of their own choice, and with one mind they slew the Lord.</p>
<p>Gen. xlix. 5 Simeon and Levi, brethren, fulfilled iniquity of their own choice. Into their
counsel let not my soul enter, and in their assembly let not my heart contend; for in their
anger they slew men, and in their passion they houghed a bull.</p>
<p>Hipp. This he says regarding the conspiracy into which they were to enter against the
Lord. And that he means this conspiracy, is evident to us. For the blessed David sings,
“Rulers have taken counsel together against the Lord,”1148 and so forth. And of this conspiracy
the Spirit prophesied, saying, “Let not my soul contend,” desiring to draw them off, if
possible, so that that future crime might not happen through them. “They slew men, and

houghed the bull;” by the “strong bull” he means Christ. And “they houghed,” since, when
He was suspended on the tree, they pierced through His sinews. Again, “in their anger they
houghed a bull.” And mark the nicety of the expression: for “they slew men, and houghed
a bull.” For they killed the saints, and they remain dead, awaiting the time of the resurrection.
But as a young bull, so to speak, when houghed, sinks down to the ground, such was Christ
in submitting voluntarily to the death of the flesh; but He was not overcome of death. But
though as man He became one of the dead, He remained alive in the nature of divinity. For
Christ is the bull,—an animal, above all, strong and neat and devoted to sacred use. And
the Son is Lord of all power, who did no sin, but rather offered Himself for us, a savour of
a sweet smell to His God and Father. Therefore let those hear who houghed this august bull:
“Cursed be their anger, for it was stubborn; and their wrath, for it was hardened.”1149 But
this people of the Jews dared to boast of houghing the bull: “Our hands shed this.”1150 For
this is nothing different, I think, from the word of folly: “His blood” (be upon us), and so
forth.1151 Moses recalls1152 the curse against Levi, or, rather converts it into a blessing, on
account of the subsequent zeal of the tribe, and of Phinehas in particular, in behalf of God.
But that against Simeon he did not recall. Wherefore it also was fulfilled in deed.1153 For
Simeon did not obtain an inheritance like the other tribes, for he dwelt in the midst of Judah.
Yet his tribe was preserved, although it was small in number.1154</p>
<p>Gen. xlix. 11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt to the choice vine,—the
tendril of the vine,—he will wash his garment in wine, and his clothes in the blood of the
grape.</p>
<p>Hipp. By the “foal” he means the calling of the Gentiles; by the other, that of the circumcision:
“one ass,” moreover, that is to signify that the two colts are of one faith; in other
words, the two callings. And one colt is bound to the “vine,” and the other to the “vine
tendril,” which means that the Church of the Gentiles is bound to the Lord, but he who is
of the circumcision to the oldness of the law. “He will wash his garment in wine;” that is,
by the Holy Spirit and the word of truth, he will cleanse the flesh, which is meant by the
garment. And “in the blood of the grape,” trodden and giving forth blood, which means the
flesh of the Lord, he cleanses the whole calling of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>Gen. xlix. 12–15 His eyes are gladsome with wine, and his teeth white as milk. Zabulun
shall dwell by the sea, and he shall be by a haven of ships, and he shall extend to Sidon. Issachar
desired the good part, resting in the midst of the lots. And seeing that rest was good,
and that the land was fat, he set his shoulder to toil, and became a husbandman.</p>
<p>Hipp. That is, his eyes are brilliant as with the word of truth; for they regard all who
believe upon him. And his teeth are white as milk;—that denotes the luminous power of his
words: for this reason he calls them white, and compares them to milk, as that which nourishes
the flesh and the soul. And Zabulun is, by interpretation, “fragrance” and “blessing.”</p>
<p>Then, after something from Cyril:—</p>
<p>Hipp. Again, I think, it mystically signifies the1155 sacraments of the New Testament
of our Saviour; and the words, “his teeth are white as milk,” denote the excellency and purity
of the sacramental food. And again, these words, “his teeth are white as milk,” we take in
the sense that His words give light to those who believe on Him.</p>
<p>And in saying, moreover, that Zabulun will dwell by the sea, he speaks prophetically of
his territory as bordering on the sea, and of Israel as mingling with the Gentiles, the two
nations being brought as it were into one flock. And this is manifest in the Gospel. “The
land of Zabulun, and the land of Nephthalim,” etc. And you will mark more fully the richness
of his lot as having both inland territory and seaboard.</p>
<p>“And he is by a haven of ships;” that is, as in a safe anchorage, referring to Christ, the
anchor of hope. And this denotes the calling of the Gentiles—that the grace of Christ shall
go forth to the whole earth and sea. For he says, “And (he is) by a haven of ships, and shall
extend as far as Sidon.” And that this is said prophetically of the Church of the Gentiles, is
made apparent to us in the Gospel: “The land of Zabulun, and the land of Nephthalim, by
the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; the people which sat in darkness
saw great light.”1156 In saying, then, that he, namely Zabulun, would inhabit a territory
bordering on the sea, he plainly confirmed that, just as if he had said that in the future Israel
would mingle with the Gentiles, the two peoples being brought together into one fold and
under the hand of one chief Shepherd, the good (Shepherd) by nature, that is, Christ. In
blessing him Moses said, “Zabulun shall rejoice.”1157 And Moses prophesies, that in the allocation
of the land he should have abundance ministered of the good things both of land
and sea, under the hand of One. “By a haven of ships;” that is, as in an anchorage that proves
safe, referring to Christ, the anchor of hope. For by His grace he shall come forth out of
many a tempest, and shall be brought hereafter to land, like ships secure in harbours. Besides,
he said that “he extends as far even as Sidon,” indicating, as it seems, that so complete a

unity will be effected in the spirit’s course between the two peoples, that those of the blood
of Israel shall occupy those very cities which once were exceeding guilty in the sight of
God.1158</p>
<p>After something from Cyril:—</p>
<p>Hipp. And “that the land was fat;” that is, the flesh of our Lord: “fat,” that is, “rich;” for
it flows with honey and milk. The parts of the land are marked off for an inheritance and
possession to him—that means the doctrine of the Lord. For this is a pleasant rest, as He
says Himself: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,”1159 etc. For they who
keep the commandments, and do not disclaim the ordinances of the law, enjoy rest both in
them and in the doctrine of our Lord; and that is the meaning of “in the midst of the lots.”
As the Lord says, “I am not come to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfil them.”1160
For even our Lord, in the fact that He keeps the commandments, does not destroy the law
and the prophets, but fulfils them, as He says in the Gospels. “He set his shoulder to toil,
and became a husbandman.” This the apostles did. Having received power from God, and
having set themselves to labour, they became husbandmen of the Lord, cultivating the
earth—that is, the human race—with the preaching of our Lord.</p>
<p>Gen. xlix. 16–20 Dan shall judge his people, as himself also one tribe in Israel. And let
Dan become a serpent by the way, lying on the path, stinging the horse’s heel; and the
horseman shall fall backward, waiting for the salvation of the Lord. Gad—a robber’s troop
shall rob him; and he shall spoil it1161 at the heels. Aser—his bread shall be fat, and he shall
furnish dainties to princes.</p>
<p>After something from Cyril, Apollinaris, and Diodorus:—</p>
<p>Hipp. The Lord is represented to us as a horseman; and the “heel” points us to the “last
times.” And His “falling” denotes His death; as it is written in the Gospel: “Behold, this
(child) is set for the fall and rising again of many.”1162 We take the “robber” to be the traitor.
Nor was there any other traitor to the Lord save the (Jewish) people. “Shall rob him,” i.e.,
shall plot against him. At the heels: that refers to the help of the Lord against those who lie
in wait against Him. And again, the words “at the heels” denote that the Lord will take
vengeance swiftly. He shall be well armed in the foot1163 (heel), and shall overtake and rob
the robber’s troop.</p>
<note type="footnote">1158 [In thus spiritualizing, the Fathers do not deny a literal sense also, as in “Aser,” p. 166, infra; only they

<p>Aquila. “Girded, he shall gird himself;” that means that as a man of arms and war he
shall arm himself. “And he shall be armed in the heel:” he means this rather, that Gad shall
follow behind his brethren in arms. For though his lot was beyond Jordan, yet they (the
men of that tribe) were enjoined to follow their brethren in arms until they too got their
lots. Or perhaps he meant this, that Gad’s tribesmen were to live in the manner of robbers,
and that he was to take up a confederacy of freebooters, which is just a “robber’s troop,”
and to follow them, practising piracy, which is robbery, along with them.</p>
<p>Whereas, on the abolition of the shadow in the law, and the introduction of the worship
in spirit and truth, the world had need of greater light, at last, with this object, the inspired
disciples were called, and put in possession of the lot of the teachers of the law. For thus did
God speak with regard to the mother of the Jews—that is to say, Jerusalem—by the voice
of the Psalmist: “Instead of thy fathers were thy sons;”1164 that is, to those called thy sons
was given the position of fathers. And with regard to our Lord Jesus Christ in particular:
“Thou wilt appoint them rulers over all the earth.” Yet presently their authority will not be
by any means void of trouble to them. Nay rather, they were to experience unnumbered
ills and they were to be in perplexity; and the course of their apostleship they were by no
means to find free of peril, as he intimated indeed by way of an example, when he said, “Let
(Dan) be,” meaning by that, that there shall be a multitude of persecutors in Dan like a
“serpent lying by the way on the path, stinging the horse’s heel,” i.e., giving fierce and dangerous
bites; for the bites of snakes are generally very dangerous. And they were “in the
heel” in particular, for “he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”1165 And
some did persecute the holy apostles in this way even to the death of the flesh. And thus we
may say that their position was something like that when a horse stumbles and flings out
his heels. For in such a case the horseman will be thrown, and, falling to the ground, I suppose,
he waits1166 thus for some one alive. And thus, too, the inspired apostles survive and
wait for the time of their redemption, when they shall be called into a kingdom which cannot
be moved, when Christ addresses them with the word, “Come, ye blessed of my Father,”1167
etc.</p>
<p>And again, if any one will take the words as meaning, not that there will be some lying
in wait against Dan like serpents, but that this Dan himself lies in wait against others, we
may say that those meant thereby are the scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites who, while in
possession of the power of judgment and instruction among the people, fastened like snakes

upon Christ, and strove impiously to compass His fall, vexing Him with their stings as He
held on in His lofty and gentle course. But if that horseman did indeed fall, He fell at least
of His own will, voluntarily enduring the death of the flesh. And, moreover, it was destined
that He should come to life again, having the Father as His helper and conductor. For the
Son, being the power of God the Father, endued the temple of His own body again with life.
Thus is He said to have been saved by the Father, as He stood in peril as a man, though by
nature He is God, and Himself maintains the whole creation, visible and invisible, in a state
of wellbeing. In this sense, also, the inspired Paul says of Him: “Though He was crucified
in weakness, yet He liveth by the power of God.”1168</p>
<p>Aser obtained the parts about Ptolemais and Sidon. Wherefore he says, “His bread shall

for “fat” means “rich.” And whose bread is rich, if not ours? For the Lord is our bread, as
He says Himself: “I am the bread of life.”1169 And who else will furnish dainties to princes
but our Lord Jesus Christ?—not only to the believing among the Gentiles, but also to those
of the circumcision, who are first in the faith, to wit, to the fathers, and the patriarchs, and
the prophets, and to all who believe in His name and passion.</p>
<p>Gen. xlix. 21–26 Nephthalim is a slender1170 thing, showing beauty in the shoot. Joseph
is a goodly son; my goodly, envied son; my youngest son. Turn back to me. Against him
the archers took counsel together, and reviled him, and pressed him sore. And their bows
were broken with might, and the sinews of the arms of their hands were relaxed by the hand
of the Mighty One of Jacob. Thence is he who strengthened Israel from the God of thy
father. And my God helped thee, and blessed thee with the blessing of heaven above, and
with the blessing of the earth which possesseth all things, with the blessing of the breasts
and womb, with the blessing of thy father and thy mother. It prevailed above the blessings
of abiding mountains, and above the blessings of everlasting hills; which (blessings) shall
be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the temples of his brothers, whose chief he was.</p>
<p>Hipp. Who is the son goodly and envied, even to this day, but our Lord Jesus Christ?
An object of envy is He indeed to those who choose to hate Him, yet He is not by any means
to be overcome. For though He endured the cross, yet as God He returned to life, having
trampled upon death, as His God and Father addresses Him, and says, “Sit Thou at my right
hand.”1171 And that even those are brought to nought who strive with the utmost possible
madness against Him, he has taught us, when he says, “Against Him the archers took
counsel together, and reviled Him.” For the “archers”—that is, the leaders of the people—did

convene their assemblies, and take bitter counsel. “But their bows were broken, and the
sinews of their arms were relaxed, by the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob,” that is to say,
by God the Father, who is the Lord of power, who also made His Son blessed in heaven and
on earth. And he (Naphtali) is adopted as a figure of things pertaining to us, as the Gospel
shows: “The land of Zabulun, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond
Jordan,”1172 etc.; and, “To them that sat in darkness light has arisen.”1173 And what other
light was this but the calling of the Gentiles, which is the trunk, i.e., the tree of the Lord, in
whom engrafted it bears fruit? And the word, “giving increase of beauty in the case of the
shoot,” expresses the excellency of our calling. And if the words, “giving increase of beauty
in the case of the shoot,” are understood, as perhaps they may, with reference to us, the
clause is still quite intelligible. For, by progressing in virtue, and attaining to better things,
“reaching forth to those things which are before,”1174 according to the word of the blessed
Paul, we rise ever to the higher beauty. I mean, however, of course, spiritual beauty, so that
to us too it may be said hereafter, “The King greatly desired thy beauty.”1175</p>
<p>After something from Apollinaris:—</p>
<p>Hipp. The word of prophecy passes again to Immanuel Himself. For, in my opinion,
what is intended by it is just what has been already stated in the words, “giving increase of
beauty in the case of the shoot.” For he means that He increased and grew up into that which
He had been from the beginning, and indicates the return to the glory which He had by
nature.1176 This, if we apprehend it correctly, is (we should say) just “restored” to Him.
For1177 as the only begotten Word of God, being God of God,1178 emptied Himself, according
to the Scriptures, humbling Himself of His own will to that which He was not before, and
took unto Himself this vile flesh, and appeared1179 in the “form of a servant,” and “became
obedient to God the Father, even unto death,” so hereafter He is said to be “highly exalted;”
and as if well-nigh He had it not by reason of His humanity, and as if it were in the way of
grace, He “receives the name which is above every name,”1180 according to the word of the

blessed Paul. But the matter, in truth, was not a “giving,” as for the first time, of what He
had not by nature; far otherwise. But rather we must understand a return and restoration
to that which existed in Him at the beginning, essentially and inseparably. And it is for this
reason that, when He had assumed, by divine arrangement,1181 the lowly estate of humanity,
He said, “Father, glorify me with the glory which I had,”1182 etc. For He who was co-existent
with His Father before all time. and before the foundation of the world, always had the glory
proper to Godhead. “He” too may very well be understood as the “youngest (son).” For He
appeared in the last times, after the glorious and honourable company of the holy prophets,
and simply once, after all those who, previous to the time of His sojourn, were reckoned in
the number of sons by reason of excellence. That Immanuel, however, was an” object of
envy,”1183 is a somewhat doubtful phrase. Yet He is an “object of envy” or “emulation” to
the saints, who aspire to follow His footsteps, and conform themselves to His divine beauty,
and make Him the pattern of their conduct, and win thereby their highest glory. And again,
He is an “object of envy” in another sense,—an “object of ill-will,” namely, to those who are
declared not to love Him. I refer to the leading parties among the Jews,—the scribes, in
sooth, and the Pharisees,—who travailed with bitter envy against Him, and made the glory
of which He could not be spoiled the ground of their slander, and assailed Him in many
ways. For Christ indeed raised the dead to life again, when they already stank and were
corrupt; and He displayed other signs of divinity. And these should have filled them with
wonder, and have made them ready to believe, and to doubt no longer. Yet this was not the
case with them; but they were consumed with ill-will, and nursed its bitter pangs in their
mind.</p>

Father in heaven after His passion. And in the phrase, “Against Him they took counsel together,
and reviled Him,” who are intended but just the people in their opposition to our

press Him sore? Those—these “archers,” namely—who think to contend against the Lord.
But though they prevailed to put Him to death, yet “their bows were broken with might.”
This plainly means, that “after the resurrection” their bows were broken with might. And
those intended are the leaders of the people, who set themselves in array against Him, and,
as it were, sharpened the points of their weapons. But they failed to transfix Him, though
they did what was unlawful, and dared to assail Him even in the manner of wild beasts.</p>
<p>“Thou didst prevail above the blessings of abiding mountains.” By “eternal and abiding
mountains and everlasting hills,” he means the saints, because they are lifted above the earth,
and make no account of the things that perish, but seek the things that are above, and aspire
earnestly to rise to the highest virtues. After the glory of Christ, therefore, are those of the
Fathers who were most illustrious, and reached the greatest elevation in virtue. These,
however, were but servants; but the Lord, the Son, supplied them with the means by which
they became illustrious. Wherefore also they acknowledge (the truth of this word), “Out of
His fulness have all we received.”1187</p>
<p>“And my God helped thee.” This indicates clearly that the aid and support of the Son

young, he was a ravening wolf; but when he believed, he “apportioned” food. This also is
shown us by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that the tribe of Benjamin is among the first
persecutors, which is the sense of “in the morning.” For Saul, who was of the tribe of Benjamin,
persecuted David, who was appointed to be a type of the Lord.</p>

Are we to say, according to the opinion of some, that there were three men made, one spiritual,
one animal, and one earthy? Not such is the case, but the whole narrative is of one
man. For the word, “Let us make,” is about the man that was to be; and then comes the
word, “God made man of the dust of the ground,” so that the narrative is of one and the

<p>1191Isaac conveys a figure of God the Father; Rebecca of the Holy Spirit; Esau of the
first people and the devil; Jacob of the Church, or of Christ. That Isaac was old, points to
the end of the world; that his eyes were dim, denotes that faith had perished from the world,
and that the light of religion was neglected before him; that the elder son is called, expresses
the Jews’ possession of the law; that the father loves his meat and venison, denotes the saving
of men from error, whom every righteous man seeks to gain (lit. hunt for) by doctrine. The
word of God here is the promise anew of the blessing and the hope of a kingdom to come,
in which the saints shall reign with Christ, and keep the true Sabbath. Rebecca is full of the
Holy Spirit, as understanding the word which she heard before she gave birth, “For the
elder shall serve the younger.”1192 As a figure of the Holy Spirit, moreover, she cares for
Jacob in preference. She says to her younger son, “Go to the flock and fetch me two kids,”1193
prefiguring the Saviour’s advent in the flesh to work a mighty deliverance for them who
were held liable to the punishment of sin; for indeed in all the Scriptures kids are taken for
emblems of sinners. His being charged to bring “two,” denotes the reception of two peoples:
by the “tender and good,” are meant teachable and innocent souls. The robe or raiment of
Esau denotes the faith and Scriptures of the Hebrews, with which the people of the Gentiles
were endowed. The skins which were put upon his arms are the sins of both peoples, which
Christ, when His hands were stretched forth on the cross, fastened to it along with Himself.
In that Isaac asks of Jacob why he came so soon,1194 we take him as admiring the quick faith
of them that believe. That savoury meats are offered, denotes an offering pleasing to God,
the salvation of sinners. After the eating follows the blessing, and he delights in his smell.
He announces with clear voice the perfection of the resurrection and the kingdom, and also
how his brethren who believe in Israel adore him and serve him. Because iniquity is opposed
to righteousness, Esau is excited to strife, and meditates death deceitfully, saying in his heart,
“Let the days of the mourning for my father come on, and I will slay my brother Jacob.”1195

most manifest disclosure of them now in Esau, showing also the time of the murder: “Let
the days,” says he, “of the mourning for my father come on, that I may slay my brother.”
Wherefore Rebecca—that is, patience—told her husband of the brother’s plot: who, summoning
Jacob, bade him go to Mesopotamia and thence take a wife of the family of Laban
the Syrian, his mother’s brother. As therefore Jacob, to escape his brother’s evil designs,
proceeds to Mesopotamia, so Christ, too, constrained by the unbelief of the Jews, goes into
Galilee, to take from thence to Himself a bride from the Gentiles, His Church.</p>

<p>On Kings.1200</p>
<p>The question is raised, whether Samuel rose by the hand of the sorceress or not. And
if, indeed, we were to allow that he did rise, we should be propounding what is false. For
how could a demon call back the soul, I say not of a righteous man merely, but of any one
whatever, when it had gone, and was tarrying one knew not where? But he says, how then
was the woman dismayed, and how did she see in an extraordinary way men ascending?
For if her vision had not been of an extraordinary kind, she would not have said, “I see
gods1201 ascending out of the earth.” She invoked one, and how did there ascend many?
What then? Shall we say that the souls of all who appeared ascended, and those, too, not
invoked by the woman;1202 or that what was seen was merely phantasms of them? Even
this, however, will not suffice. How, he urges further, did Saul recognise (what appeared),
and do obeisance? Well, Saul did not actually see, but only, on being told by the woman that
the figure of one of those who ascended was the figure he desired, and taking it to be Samuel,
he consulted it as such, and did it obeisance. And it could be no difficult matter for the demon
to conjure up the form of Samuel, as it was known to him. How then, says he, did he foretell
the calamities that were to befall Saul and Jonathan at the same time? He did foretell indeed
the end of the war, and how Saul would be overcome, drawing that as an inference from
the wrath of God against him. Just as a physician, who has no exact knowledge of the science,
might yet, seeing a patient past cure, tell of his death, though he made an error as to the
hour, so, too, the demon, knowing the wrath of God by Saul’s deeds, and by this very attempt
to consult the sorceress, foretells his defeat and his death at the same time, though in error
as to the day of his death.</p>

<p>The book of Psalms contains new doctrine after the law of Moses. And after the writing
of Moses, it is the second book of doctrine. Now, after the death of Moses and Joshua, and
after the judges, arose David, who was deemed worthy of bearing the name of father of the
Saviour himself; and he first gave to the Hebrews a new style of psalmody, by which he abrogates
the ordinances established by Moses with respect to sacrifices, and introduces the
new hymn and a new style of jubilant praise in the worship of God; and throughout his
whole ministry he teaches very many other things that went beyond the law of Moses.1204</p>

<p>When he came into the world, He was manifested as God and man. And it is easy to
perceive the man in Him, when He hungers and shows exhaustion, and is weary and athirst,
and withdraws in fear, and is in prayer and in grief, and sleeps on a boat’s pillow, and entreats
the removal of the cup of suffering, and sweats in an agony, and is strengthened by an angel,
and betrayed by a Judas, and mocked by Caiaphas, and set at nought by Herod, and scourged
by Pilate, and derided by the soldiers, and nailed to the tree by the Jews, and with a cry
commits His spirit to His Father, and drops His head and gives up the ghost, and has His
side pierced with a spear, and is wrapped in linen and laid in a tomb, and is raised by the
Father on the third day. And the divine in Him, on the other hand, is equally manifest, when
He is worshipped by angels, and seen by shepherds, and waited for by Simeon, and testified
of by Anna, and inquired after by wise men, and pointed out by a star, and at a marriage
makes wine of water, and chides the sea when tossed by the violence of winds, and walks
upon the deep, and makes one see who was blind from birth, and raises Lazarus when dead
for four days, and works many wonders, and forgives sins, and grants power to His disciples.</p>

body; for excess in diet was what produced it, while the physician’s science only made it
show itself; so, although it may be said that the painful retribution that falls upon those who
are by choice wicked comes from God, it would be only in accordance with right reason, to
think that ills of that kind find both their beginnings and their causes in ourselves. For to
one who lives without sin there is no darkness, no worm, no hell (Gehenna), no fire, nor
any other of these words or things of terror; just as the plagues of Egypt were not for the
Hebrews,—those fine lice annoying with invisible bites, the dog-fly fastening on the body
with its painful sting, the hurricanes from heaven falling upon them with hailstones, the
husbandman’s labours devoured by the locusts, the darkened sky, and the rest. It is God’s
counsel, indeed, to tend the true vine, and to destroy the Egyptian, while sparing those who
are to “eat the grape of gall, and drink the deadly venom of asps.”1212 And the sycamine of
Egypt is utterly destroyed; not, however, that one which Zaccheus climbed that he might
be able to see my Lord. And the fruits of Egypt are wasted, that is, the works of the flesh,
but not the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, and peace.1213</p>
<p>48. He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their substance to the fire.</p>
<p>Symmachus renders it: “Who gave up their cattle to the plague, and their possessions
to birds.” For, having met an overwhelming overthrow, they became a prey for carnivorous
birds. But, according to the Seventy, the sense is not that the hail destroyed their cattle, and
the fire the rest of their substance, but that hail, falling in an extraordinary manner along
with fire, destroyed utterly their vines and sycamines first of all, which were entirely unable
to stand out against the first attack; then the cattle which grazed on the plains; and then
every herb and tree, which the fire accompanying the hail consumed; and the affair was altogether
portentous, as fire ran with the water, and was commingled with it. “For fire ran
in the hail,” he says; and it was thus hail, and fire burning in the hail. David also calls the
cattle and the fruit of the trees “substance,” or “riches.” And it should be observed that,
though the hail is recorded to have destroyed every herb and every tree, yet there were left

some which the locust, as it came upon them after the fiery hail, consumed; of which it is
said, that it eats up every herb, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail left behind it. Now,
in a spiritual sense, there are some sheep belonging to Christ, and others belonging to the
Egyptians. Those, however, which once belonged to others may become His, as the sheep
of Laban became Jacob’s; and contrariwise. Whichever of the sheep, moreover, Jacob rejected,
he made over to Esau. Beware, then, lest, being found in the flock of Jesus, you be set apart
when gifts are sent to Esau, and be given over to Esau as reprobate and unworthy of the
spiritual Jacob. The single-minded are the sheep of Christ, and these God saves according
to the word: “O Lord, Thou preservest man and beast.”1214 They who in their folly attach
themselves to godless doctrine, are the sheep of the Egyptians, and these, too, are destroyed
by the hail. And whatsoever the Egyptians possess is given over to the fire, but Abraham’s
substance is given to Isaac.</p>
<p>49. He discharged upon them the wrath of His anger;—anger, and wrath, and tribulation,
a visitation by evil angels.</p>
<p>Under anger, wrath, and tribulation, he intended bitter punishments; for God is without
passion. And by anger you will understand the lesser penalties, and by wrath the greater,
and by tribulation the greatest. 1215The angels also are called evil, not because they are so
in their nature, or by their own will, but because they have this office, and are appointed to
produce pains and sufferings,—being so called, therefore, with reference to the disposition
of those who endure such things; just as the day of judgment is called the evil day, as being
laden with miseries and pains for sinners. To the same effect is the word of Isaiah, “I, the
Lord, make peace, and create evil;”1216 meaning by that, I maintain peace, and permit war.</p>

<p>On Proverbs. From the Commentary of St. Hippolytus on Proverbs.1217</p>
<p>Proverbs, therefore, are words of exhortation serviceable for the whole path of life; for
to those who seek their way to God, these serve as guides and signs to revive them when
wearied with the length of the road. These, moreover, are the proverbs of “Solomon,” that
is to say, the “peacemaker,” who, in truth, is Christ the Saviour. And since we understand
the words of the Lord without offence, as being the words of the Lord, that no one may
mislead us by likeness of name, he tells us who wrote these things, and of what people he
was king, in order that the credit of the speaker may make the discourse acceptable and the
hearers attentive; for they are the words of that Solomon to whom the Lord said: “I will
give thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there has been none like thee upon the
earth, and after thee there shall not arise any like unto thee,”1218 and as follows in what is
written of him. Now he was the wise son of a wise father; wherefore there is added the name
of David, by whom Solomon was begotten. From a child he was instructed in the sacred
Scriptures, and obtained his dominion not by lot, nor by force, but by the judgment of the
Spirit and the decree of God.</p>
<p>“To know wisdom and instruction.” He who knows the wisdom of God, receives from
Him also instruction, and learns by it the mysteries of the Word; and they who know the
true heavenly wisdom will easily understand the words of these mysteries. Wherefore he
says: “To understand the difficulties of words;”1219 for things spoken in strange language
by the Holy Spirit become intelligible to those who have their hearts right with God.</p>
<p>1220These things he understands of the people of the Jews, and their guilt in the blood
of Christ; for they thought that He had His conversation (citizenship) on earth only.</p>
<p>1221They will not simply obtain, but inherit. The wicked, again, even though they are
exalted, are exalted only so as to have greater dishonour. For as one does not honour an
ugly and misshapen fellow, if he exalts him, but only dishonours him the more, by making
his shame manifest to a larger number; so also God exalts the wicked, in order that He may
make their disgrace patent. For Pharaoh was exalted, but only to have the world as his accuser.</p>
<p>1222It must be noted, that he names the law a good gift, on account of the man who
takes gifts into his bosom unrighteously. And he forsakes the law who transgresses it; the
law, namely, of which he speaks, or which he has kept.</p>

<p>1223And what is meant by “exalt (fortify) her?” Surround her with holy thoughts; for
you have need of large defence, since there are many things to imperil such a possession.
But if it is in our power to fortify her, and if there are virtues in our power which exalt the
knowledge of God, these will be her bulwarks,—as, for example, practice, study, and the
whole chain of other virtues; and the man who observes these, honours wisdom; and the
reward is, to be exalted to be with her, and to be embraced by her in the chamber of heaven.</p>
<p>1224The heterodox are the “wicked,” and the transgressors of the law are “evil men,”
whose “ways”—that is to say, their deeds—he bids us not enter.</p>
<p>1225He “looks right on” who has thoughts free of passion; and he has true judgments,
who is not in a state of excitement about external appearances. When he says, “Let thine
eyes look right on,” he means the vision of the soul; and when he gives the exhortation, “Eat
honey, my son, that it may be sweet to thy palate,” he uses “honey” figuratively, meaning
divine doctrine, which restores the spiritual knowledge of the soul. But wisdom embraces
the soul also; for, says he, “love her, that she may embrace thee.” And the soul, by her embrace
being made one with wisdom, is filled with holiness and purity. Yea more, the fragrant
ointments of Christ are laid hold of by the soul’s sense of smell.</p>
<p>1226Virtue occupies the middle position; whence also he says, that manly courage is the
mean between boldness and cowardice. And now he mentions the “right,” not meaning
thereby things which are right by nature, such as the virtues, but things which seem to thee
to be right on account of their pleasures. Now pleasures are not simply sensual enjoyments,
but also riches and luxury. And the “left” indicates envy, robberies, and the like. For “Boreas,”
says he, “is a bitter wind, and yet is called by name right.”1227 For, symbolically, under
Boreas he designates the wicked devil by whom every flame of evil is kindled in the earth.
And this has the name “right,” because an angel is called by a right (propitious) name. Do
thou, says he, turn aside from evil, and God will take care of thine end; for He will go before
thee, scattering thine enemies, that thou mayest go in peace.</p>
<p>1228He shows also, by the mention of the creature (the hind), the purity of that pleasure;
and by the roe he intimates the quick responsive affection of the wife. And whereas he knows
many things to excite, he secures them against these, and puts upon them the indissoluble
bond of affection, setting constancy before them. And as for the rest, wisdom, figuratively
speaking, like a stag, can repel and crush the snaky doctrines of the heterodox. Let her

therefore, says he, be with thee, like a roe, to keep all virtue fresh. And whereas a wife and
wisdom are not in this respect the same, let her rather lead thee; for thus thou shalt conceive
good thoughts.</p>
<p>1229That thou mayest not say, What harm is there in the eyes, when there is no necessity
that he should be perverted who looks? he shows thee that desire is a fire, and the flesh is
like a garment. The latter is an easy prey, and the former is a tyrant. And when anything
harmful is not only taken within, but also held fast, it will not go forth again until it has
made an exit for itself. For he who looks upon a woman, even though he escape the
temptation, does not come away pure of all lust. And why should one have trouble, if he
can be chaste and free of trouble? See what Job says: “I made a covenant with mine eyes,
that I should not think of another’s wife.”1230 Thus well does he know the power of abuse.
And Paul for this reason kept “under his body, and brought it into subjection.” And, figuratively
speaking, he keeps a fire in his breast who permits an impure thought to dwell in his
heart. And he walks upon coals who, by sinning in act, destroys his own soul.</p>
<p>The “cemphus”1231 is a kind of wild sea-bird, which has so immoderate an impulse to
sexual enjoyment, that its eyes seem to fill with blood in coition; and it often blindly falls
into snares, or into the hands of men.1232 To this, therefore, he compares the man who gives
himself up to the harlot on account of his immoderate lust; or else on account of the insensate
folly of the creature, for he, too, pursues his object like one senseless. And they say that this
bird is so much pleased with foam, that if one should hold foam in his hand as he sails, it
will sit upon his hand. And it also brings forth with pain.</p>
<p>1233You have seen her mischief. Wait not to admit the rising of lust; for her death is
everlasting. And for the rest, by her words, her arguments in sooth, she wounds, and by her
sins she kills those who yield to her. For many are the forms of wickedness that lead the
foolish down to hell. And the chambers1234 of death mean either its depths or its treasure.
How, then, is escape possible?</p>

<p>1235He intends the new Jerusalem, or the sanctified flesh. By the seven pillars he means
the sevenfold unity of the Holy Spirit resting upon it; as Isaiah testifies, saying, “She has
slain” her “victims.”</p>
<p>1236Observe that the wise man must be useful to many; so that he who is useful only to
himself cannot be wise. For great is the condemnation of wisdom if she reserves her power
simply for the one possessing her. But as poison is not injurious to another body, but only
to that one which takes it, so also the man who turns out wicked will injure himself, and
not another. For no man of real virtue is injured by a wicked man.</p>
<p>1237The fruit of righteousness and the tree of life is Christ. He alone, as man, fulfilled
all righteousness. And with His own underived life1238 He has brought forth the fruits of
knowledge and virtue like a tree, whereof they that eat shall receive eternal life, and shall
enjoy the tree of life in paradise, with Adam and all the righteous. But the souls of the unrighteous
meet an untimely expulsion from the presence of God, by whom they shall be left
to remain in the flame of torment.</p>
<p>1239Not from men, but with the Lord, will he obtain favour.</p>
<p>1240He asks of wisdom, who seeks to know what is the will of God. And he will show
himself prudent who is sparing of his words on that which he has come to learn. If one inquires
about wisdom, desiring to learn something about wisdom, while another asks nothing
of wisdom, as not only wishing to learn nothing about wisdom himself, but even keeping
back his neighbours from so doing, the former certainly is deemed to be more prudent than
the latter.</p>
<p>1241As to the horse-leech. There were three daughters fondly loved by sin—fornication,
murder,1242 and idolatry. These three did not satisfy her, for she is not to be satisfied. In
destroying man by these actions, sin never varies, but only grows continually. For the fourth,
he continues, is never content to say “enough,” meaning that it is universal lust. In naming
the “fourth,” he intends lust in the universal. For as the body is one, and yet has many
members; so also sin, being one, contains within it many various lusts by which it lays its
snares for men. Wherefore, in order to teach us this, he uses the examples of Sheol (Hades),
and the love of women, and hell1243 (Tartarus), and the earth that is not filled with water.

And water and fire, indeed, will never say, “It is enough.” And the grave1244 (Hades) in no
wise ceases to receive the souls of unrighteous men; nor does the love of sin, in the instance
of the love of women, cease to be given to fornication, and it becomes the betrayer of the
soul. And as Tartarus, which is situated in a doleful and dark locality, is not touched by a
ray of light, so is every one who is the slave of sin in all the passions of the flesh. Like the
earth not filled with water he is never able to come to confession, and to the laver of regeneration,
and like water and fire, never says, “It is enough.”</p>
<p>1245For as a serpent cannot mark its track upon a rock, so the devil could not find sin
in the body of Christ. For the Lord says, “Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and will
find nothing in me.”1246—For as a ship, sailing in the sea, leaves no traces of her way behind
her, so neither does the Church, which is situate in the world as in a sea, leave her hope
upon the earth, because she has her life reserved in heaven; and as she holds her way here
only for a short time, it is not possible to trace out her course.—As the Church does not
leave her hope behind in the world, her hope in the incarnation of Christ which bears us all
good, she did not leave the track of death in Hades.—Of whom but of Him who is born of
the Holy Spirit and the Virgin?—who, in renewing the perfect man in the world, works
miracles, beginning from the baptism of John, as the Evangelist also testifies: And Jesus was
then beginning to be about thirty years of age. This, then, was the youthful and blooming
period of the age of Him who, in journeying among the cities and districts, healed the diseases
and infirmities of men.</p>
<p>1247“The eye that mocketh at his father, and dishonours the old age of his mother.” That
is to say, one that blasphemes God and despises the mother of Christ, the wisdom of
God,—his eyes may ravens from the caves tear out, i.e., him may unclean and wicked spirits
deprive of the clear eye of gladness; and may the young eagles devour him: and such shall
be trodden under the feet of the saints.</p>
<p>1248“There be three things which I cannot understand, and the fourth I know not: the
tracks of an eagle flying,” i.e., Christ’s ascension; “and the ways of a serpent upon a rock,”
i.e., that the devil did not find a trace of sin in the body of Christ; “and the ways of a ship
crossing the sea,” i.e., the ways of the Church, which is in this life as in a sea, and which is
directed by her hope in Christ through the cross; “and the ways of a man in youth,”1249—the

<p>1251“Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who, when she has done the deed of sin,
wipeth herself, and will say that no wickedness has been done.” Such is the conduct of the
Church that believes on Christ, when, after committing fornication with idols, she renounces
these and the devil, and is cleansed of her sins and receives forgiveness, and then asserts
that she has done no wickedness.</p>
<p>1252“By three things the earth is moved,” viz., by the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
“And the fourth it cannot bear,” viz., the last appearing of Christ. “When a servant reigneth:”
Israel was a slave in Egypt, and in the land of promise became a ruler. “And a fool when he
is filled with meat:” i.e., getting the land in possession readily, and eating its fruit, and being
filled, it (the people) kicked. “And a handmaid when she casts out her mistress:” i.e., the
synagogue which took the life of the Lord, and crucified the flesh of Christ.</p>
<p>1253“There be four things which are least upon the earth, and these are wiser than the
wise: The ants have no strength, yet they prepare their meat in the summer.” And in like
manner, the Gentiles by faith in Christ prepare for themselves eternal life through good
works. “And the conies,1254 a feeble folk, have made their houses in the rocks.” The Gentiles,
that is to say, are built upon Christ, the spiritual rock, which is become the head of the
corner. “The spider,1255 that supports itself upon its hands, and is easily caught, dwells in
the strongholds of kings.” That is, the thief with his hands extended (on the cross), rests on
the cross of Christ and dwells in Paradise, the stronghold of the three Kings—Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost.</p>

had no king, for they were ruled by sin; but now, believing God, they engage in the heavenly
warfare.</p>

of truth.</p>
<p>1258That is one confirmed in wickedness.1259 The apostle, too, says, “Them that sin,
rebuke before all;”1260 that is to say, all but reprobate. Who are meant by the “conies,”1261

now, believing in Christ, we build our houses upon the holy flesh of Christ as upon a rock?</p>
<p>1262The shaking (of the earth) signifies the change of things upon earth.—Sin, then,
which in its own nature is a slave, has reigned in the mortal body of men: once, indeed, at
the time of the flood; and again in the time of the Sodomites, who, not satisfied with what
the land yielded, offered violence to strangers; and a third time in the case of hateful Egypt,
which, though it obtained in Joseph a man who distributed food to all, that they might not
perish of famine, yet did not take well with his prosperity, but persecuted the children of
Israel. “The handmaid casting out her mistress:” i.e., the Church of the Gentiles, which,
though itself a slave and a stranger to the promises, cast out the free-born and lordly synagogue,
and became the wife and bride of Christ. By Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the whole
earth is moved. The “fourth it cannot bear:” for He came first by lawgivers, and secondly

<p>Another Fragment.1263 St. Hippolytus1264 on Prov. ix. 1, “Wisdom Hath Builded
Her House.”</p>
<p>Christ, he means, the wisdom and power of God the Father, hath builded His house,
i.e., His nature in the flesh derived from the Virgin, even as he (John) hath said beforetime,
“The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us.”1265 As likewise the wise prophet1266 testifies:
Wisdom that was before the world, and is the source of life, the infinite “Wisdom of God,
hath builded her house” by a mother who knew no man,—to wit, as He assumed the temple
of the body. “And hath raised1267 her seven pillars;” that is, the fragrant grace of the all-holy
Spirit, as Isaiah says: “And the seven spirits of God shall rest upon Him.”1268 But others say
that the seven pillars are the seven divine orders which sustain the creation by His holy and
inspired teaching; to wit, the prophets, the apostles, the martyrs, the hierarchs, the hermits,
the saints, and the righteous. And the phrase, “She hath killed her beasts,” denotes the
prophets and martyrs who in every city and country are slain like sheep every day by the
unbelieving, in behalf of the truth, and cry aloud, “For thy sake we are killed all the day long,
we were counted as sheep for the slaughter.”1269 And again, “She hath mingled her wine”
in the bowl, by which is meant, that the Saviour, uniting his Godhead, like pure wine, with
the flesh in the Virgin, was born of her at once God and man without confusion of the one
in the other. “And she hath furnished her table:” that denotes the promised knowledge of
the Holy Trinity; it also refers to His honoured and undefiled body and blood, which day
by day are administered and offered sacrificially at the spiritual divine table, as a memorial

the knowledge of Him in truth, with their lofty and divine preaching. And again, “And to

<p>On the Song of Songs.1270</p>
<p>1. Arise, O north wind, and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices
thereof may flow out (Canticles iv. 16). As Joseph was delighted with these spices, he is
designated the King’s son by God; as the Virgin Mary was anointed with them, she conceived
the Word: then new secrets, and new truth, and a new kingdom, and also great and inexplicable
mysteries, are made manifest.</p>
<p>2. And where is all this rich knowledge? and where are these mysteries? and where are
the books? For the only ones extant are Proverbs, and Wisdom, and Ecclesiastes, and the
Song of Songs. What then? Does the Scripture speak falsely? God forbid. But the matter of
his writings was various, as is shown in the phrase “Song of Songs;” for that indicates that
in this one book he digested the contents of the 5,000 songs.1271 In the days moreover of
Hezekiah, there were some of the books selected for use, and others set aside. Whence the
Scripture says, “These are the mixed1272 Proverbs of Solomon, which the friends of
Hezekiah the king copied out.”1273 And whence did they take them, but out of the books
containing the 3,000 parables and the 5,000 songs? Out of these, then, the wise friends of
Hezekiah took those portions which bore upon the edification of the Church. And the books
of Solomon on the “Parables” and “Songs,” in which he wrote of the physiology of plants,
and all kinds of animals belonging to the dry land, and the air, and the sea, and of the cures
of disease, Hezekiah did away with, because the people looked to these for the remedies for
their diseases, and neglected to seek their healing from God.1274</p>

showed that thus early did God the Word seek His pleasure in the Church gathered from among the Gentiles,
and especially in His most holy mother the Virgin; and thus the Syrians, who boasted that the Virgin was born
among them, translated the Commentary of Hippolytus at a very early period from the Greek into their own
tongue, of which some fragments still remain,—as, for example, one to this effect on the above words.</note>

Hippolytus, (Bishop) of Rome on Hezekiah.1276</head>
<p>When Hezekiah, king of Judah, was still sick and weeping, there came an angel, and
said to him: “I have seen thy tears, and I have heard thy voice. Behold, I add unto thy time
fifteen years. And this shall be a sign to thee from the Lord: Behold, I turn back the shadow
of the degrees of the house of thy father, by which the sun has gone down, the ten degrees
by which the shadow has gone down,”1277 so that day be a day of thirty-two hours. For
when the sun had run its course to the tenth hour, it returned again. And again, when Joshua
the son of Nun was fighting against the Amorites, when the sun was now inclining to its
setting, and the battle was being pressed closely, Joshua, being anxious lest the heathen host
should escape on the descent of night, cried out, saying, “Sun, stand thou still in Gibeon;
and thou moon, in the valley of Ajalon,”1278 until I vanquish this people. And the sun stood
still, and the moon, in their places, so that day was one of twenty-four hours. And in the
time of Hezekiah the moon also turned back along with the sun, that there might be no
collision between the two elemental bodies, by their bearing against each other in defiance
of law. And Merodach the Chaldean, king of Babylon, being struck with amazement at that
time—for he studied the science of astrology, and measured the courses of these bodies
carefully—on learning the cause, sent a letter and gifts to Hezekiah, just as also the wise men
from the east did to Christ.</p>

<p>We find in the commentaries, written by our predecessors, that day had thirty-two

had gone down by the ten degrees in the house of the temple, the sun turned back again by
the ten degrees, according to the word of the Lord, and there were thus twenty hours. And
again, the sun accomplished its own proper course, according to the common law, and
reached its setting. And thus there were thirty-two hours.1281</p>

<p>What were the dimensions, then, of the temple of Solomon? Its length was sixty cubits,

worship the rising sun, but the Lord of the sun. And let no one marvel if, when the Scripture
gives the length at forty cubits, I have said sixty. For a little after it mentions the other twenty,
in describing the holy of holies, which it also names Dabir. Thus the holy place was forty
cubits, and the holy of holies other twenty. And Josephus says that the temple had two
storeys,1283 and that the whole height was one hundred and twenty cubits. For so also the
book of Chronicles indicates, saying, “And Solomon began to build the house of God. In
length its first measure was sixty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and its height one

<head>On Daniel.</head>
<head>I.</head>
<p>Preface by the most holy Hippolytus, (Bishop) of Rome.1285</p>
<p>As I wish to give an accurate account of the times of the captivity of the children of Israel
in Babylon, and to discuss the prophecies contained in the visions of the blessed Daniel, (as
well as) his manner of life from his boyhood in Babylon, I too shall proceed to bear my
testimony to that holy and righteous man, a prophet and witness of Christ, who not only
declared the visions of Nebuchadnezzar the king in those times, but also trained youths of
like mind with himself, and raised up faithful witnesses in the world. He is born, then, in
the time of the prophetic ministry of the blessed Jeremiah, and in the reign of Jehoiakim or
Eliakim. Along with the other captives, he is carried off a prisoner to Babylon. Now there
are born to the blessed Josiah these five sons—Jehoahaz, Eliakim, Johanan, Zedekiah, or
Jeconiah, and Sadum.1286 And on his father’s death, Jehoahaz is anointed as king by the
people at the age of twenty-three years. Against him comes up Pharaoh-Necho, in the third
month of his reign; and he takes him (Jehoahaz) prisoner, and carries him into Egypt, and
imposes tribute on the land to the extent of one hundred talents of silver and ten talents of
gold. And in his stead he sets up his brother Eliakim as king over the land, whose name also
he changed to Jehoiakim, and who was then eleven years old. Against him came up
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,1287 and carries him off prisoner to Babylon, taking with
him also some of the vessels of the house in Jerusalem. Thrown into prison as a friend of
Pharaoh, and as one set up by him over the kingdom,1288 he is released at length in the
thirty-seventh year by Evil-Merodach king of Babylon; and he cut his hair short, and was
counsellor to him, and ate at his table until the day that he died. On his removal, his son
Jehoiakim1289 reigns three years.1290 And against him came up Nebuchadnezzar, and
transports him and ten thousand of the men of his people to Babylon, and sets up in his
stead his father’s brother, whose name he changed also to Zedekiah; and after making
agreement with him by oath and treaty, he returns to Babylon. This (Zedekiah), after a reign
of eleven years, revolted from him and went over to Pharaoh king of Egypt. And in the tenth

year Nebuchadnezzar came against him from the land of the Chaldeans, and surrounded
the city with a stockade, and environed it all round, and completely shut it up. In this way
the larger number of them perished by famine, and others perished by the sword, and some
were taken prisoners, and the city was burned with fire, and the temple and the wall were
destroyed. And the army of the Chaldeans seized all the treasure that was found in the house
of the Lord, and all the vessels of gold and silver; and all the brass, Nebuzaradan, chief of
the slaughterers,1291 stripped off, and carried it to Babylon. And the army of the Chaldeans
pursued Zedekiah himself as he fled by night along with seven hundred men, and surprised
him in Jericho, and brought him to the king of Babylon at Reblatha. And the king pronounced
judgment upon him in wrath, because he had violated the oath of the Lord, and the agreement
he had made with him; and he slew his sons before his face, and put out Zedekiah’s eyes.
And he cast him into chains of iron, and carried him to Babylon; and there he remained
grinding at the mill until the day of his death. And when he died, they took his body and
cast it behind the wall of Nineveh. In his case is fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah, saying,
“(As) I live, saith the Lord, though Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah should become
the signet upon my right hand, yet will I pluck thee thence; and I will give thee into the
hands of them that seek thy life, of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hands of the
Chaldeans. And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into a country where
thou wast not born; and there ye shall die. But to the land which they desire in their souls,
I will not send thee back. Dishonoured is Jeconias, like an unserviceable vessel, of which
there is no use, since he is cast out and expelled into a land which he knew not. O earth,
hear the word of the Lord. Write this man, a man excommunicate; for no man of his seed
shall prosper (grow up), sitting upon the throne of David, ruling any more in Judah.”1292
Thus the captivity in Babylon befell them after the exodus from Egypt. When the whole
people, then, was transported, and the city made desolate. and the sanctuary destroyed, that
the word of the Lord might be fulfilled which He spake by the mouth of the prophet
Jeremiah, saying, “The sanctuary shall be desolate seventy years;”1293 then we find that the
blessed Daniel prophesied in Babylon, and appeared as the vindicator of Susanna.</p>

<head>II.
The interpretation by Hippolytus, (bishop) of Rome, of the visions of Daniel and
Nebuchadnezzar, taken in conjunction.1294</head>
<p>1. In speaking of a “lioness from the sea,”1295 he meant the rising of the kingdom of
Babylon, and that this was the “golden head of the image.” And in speaking of its “eagle
wings,” he meant that king Nebuchadnezzar was exalted and that his glory was lifted up
against God. Then he says “its wings were plucked off,” i.e., that his glory was destroyed;
for he was driven out of his kingdom. And the words, “A man’s heart was given it, and it
was made stand upon the feet of a man,” mean that he came to himself again, and recognised
that he was but a man, and gave the glory to God. Then after the lioness he sees a second
beast, “like a bear,” which signified the Persians. For after the Babylonians the Persians obtained
the power. And in saying that “it had three ribs in its mouth,” he pointed to the three
nations, Persians, Medes, and Babylonians, which were expressed in the image by the silver
after the gold. Then comes the third beast, “a leopard,” which means the Greeks; for after
the Persians, Alexander of Macedon had the power, when Darius was overthrown, which
was also indicated by the brass in the image. And in saying that the beast “had four wings
of a fowl, and four heads,” he showed most clearly how the kingdom of Alexander was
parted into four divisions. For in speaking of four heads, he meant the four kings that arose
out of it. For Alexander, when dying, divided his kingdom into four parts. Then he says,
“The fourth beast (was) dreadful and terrible: it had iron teeth, and claws of brass.” Who,
then, are meant by this but the Romans, whose kingdom, the kingdom that still stands, is
expressed by the iron? “for,” says he, “its legs are of iron.”</p>
<p>2. After this, then, what remains, beloved, but the toes of the feet of the image, in which
“part shall be of iron and part of clay mixed together?” By the toes of the feet he meant,
mystically, the ten kings that rise out of that kingdom. As Daniel says, “I considered the
beast; and, lo, (there were) ten horns behind, among which shall come up another little horn
springing from them;” by which none other is meant than the antichrist that is to rise; and
he shall set up the kingdom of Judah. And in saying that “three horns” were “plucked up
by the roots” by this one, he indicates the three kings of Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia, whom
this one will slay in the array of war. And when he has conquered all, he will prove himself
a terrible and savage tyrant, and will cause tribulation and persecution to the saints, exalting
<note type="footnote">1294 The same method of explaining the two visions is also adopted by Jacobus Nisibenus, serm. v., and by
his illustrious disciple Ephraem Syrus on Dan. vii. 4. [Let me again refer to Dr. Pusey’s work on Daniel, as invaluable
in this connection. The comments of our author on this book and on “the Antichrist,” infra, deserve
special attention, as from a disciple of the disciples of St. John himself.]</note>

himself against them. And after him, it remains that “the stone” shall come from heaven
which “smote the image” and shivered it, and subverted all the kingdoms, and gave the
kingdom to the saints of the Most High. This “became a great mountain, and filled the whole
earth.”</p>
<p>3. As these things, then, are destined to come to pass, and as the toes of the image turn
out to be democracies,1296 and the ten horns of the beast are distributed among ten kings,
let us look at what is before us more carefully, and scan it, as it were, with open eye. The
“golden head of the image” is identical with the “lioness,” by which the Babylonians were
represented. “The golden shoulders and the arms of silver” are the same with the “bear,” by
which the Persians and Medes are meant. “The belly and thighs of brass” are the “leopard,”
by which the Greeks who ruled from Alexander onwards are intended. The “legs of iron”
are the “dreadful and terrible beast,” by which the Romans who hold the empire now are
meant. The “toes of clay and iron” are the “ten horns” which are to be. The “one other little
horn springing up in their midst” is the “antichrist.” The stone that “smites the image and
breaks it in pieces,” and that filled the whole earth, is Christ, who comes from heaven and
brings judgment on the world.</p>
<p>4. But that we may not leave our subject at this point undemonstrated, we are obliged
to discuss the matter of the times, of which a man should not speak hastily, because they
are a light to him. For as the times are noted from the foundation of the world, and reckoned
from Adam, they set clearly before us the matter with which our inquiry deals. For the first
appearance of our Lord in the flesh took place in Bethlehem, under Augustus, in the year
5500; and He suffered in the thirty-third year. And 6,000 years must needs be accomplished,
in order that the Sabbath may come, the rest, the holy day “on which God rested from all
His works.”1297 For the Sabbath is the type and emblem of the future kingdom of the saints,
when they “shall reign with Christ,” when He comes from heaven, as John says in his Apocalypse:
for “a day with the Lord is as a thousand years.”1298 Since, then, in six days God
made all things, it follows that 6,000 years must be fulfilled. And they are not yet fulfilled,
as John says: “five are fallen; one is,” that is, the sixth; “the other is not yet come.”1299</p>
<p>5. In mentioning the “other,” moreover, he specifies the seventh, in which there is rest.
But some one may be ready to say, How will you prove to me that the Saviour was born in
the year 5500? Learn that easily, O man; for the things that took place of old in the wilderness,
<note type="footnote">1296 [True in a.d. 1885. A very pregnant testimony to our own times.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1297 This is what Photius condemned in Hippolytus. Irenæus, however, held the same opinion (book v. c.
28 and 29). The same view is expressed yet earlier in the Epistle of Barnabas (sec. 15). It was an opinion adopted
from the rabbis.</note>

<pb n="455"/>
under Moses, in the case of the tabernacle, were constituted types and emblems of spiritual
mysteries, in order that, when the truth came in Christ in these last days, you might be able
to perceive that these things were fulfilled. For He says to him, “And thou shalt make the
ark of imperishable wood, and shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without; and thou
shalt make the length of it two cubits and a half, and the breadth thereof one cubit and a
half, and a cubit and a half the height;”1300 which measures, when summed up together,
make five cubits and a half, so that the 5500 years might be signified thereby.</p>
<p>6. At that time, then, the Saviour appeared and showed His own body to the world,
(born) of the Virgin, who was the “ark overlaid with pure gold,” with the Word within and
the Holy Spirit without; so that the truth is demonstrated, and the “ark” made manifest.
From the birth of Christ, then, we must reckon the 500 years that remain to make up the
6000, and thus the end shall be. And that the Saviour appeared in the world, bearing the
imperishable ark, His own body, at a time which was the fifth and half, John declares: “Now
it was the sixth hour,”1301 he says, intimating by that, one-half of the day. But a day with
the Lord is 1000 years; and the half of that, therefore, is 500 years. For it was not meet that
He should appear earlier, for the burden of the law still endured, nor yet when the sixth day
was fulfilled (for the baptism is changed), but on the fifth and half, in order that in the remaining
half time the gospel might be preached to the whole world, and that when the sixth
day was completed He might end the present life.</p>
<p>7. Since, then, the Persians held the mastery for 330 years,1302 and after them the Greeks,
who were yet more glorious, held it for 300 years, of necessity the fourth beast, as being
strong and mightier than all that were before it, will reign 500 years. When the times are
fulfilled, and the ten horns spring from the beast in the last (times), then Antichrist will
appear among them. When he makes war against the saints, and persecutes them, then may
we expect the manifestation of the Lord from heaven.</p>
<p>8. The prophet having thus instructed us with all exactness as to the certainty of the
things that are to be, broke off from his present subject, and passed again to the kingdom
of the Persians and Greeks, recounting to us another vision which took place, and was fulfilled
in its proper time; in order that, by establishing our belief in this, he might be able to present
us to God as readier believers in the things that are to be. Accordingly, what he had narrated
in the first vision, he again recounts in detail for the edification of the faithful. For by the

<note type="footnote">1302 Migne thinks we should read διακόσια τριάκοντα, i.e., 230, as it is also in Julius Africanus, who was
contemporary with Hippolytus. As to the duration of the Greek empire, Hippolytus and Africanus make it both
300 years, if we follow Jerome’s version of the latter in his comment on Dan. ix. 24. Eusebius makes it seventy
years longer in his Demonstr. Evang., viii. 2.</note>

“ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward,” he means Darius, the king of the
Persians, who overcame all the nations; “for,” says he, “these beasts shall not stand before
him.” And by the “he-goat that came from the west,” he means Alexander the Macedonian,
the king of the Greeks; and in that he “came against that very ram, and was moved with
choler, and smote him upon the face, and shivered him, and cast him upon the ground, and
stamped upon him,” this expresses just what has happened.</p>
<p>9. For Alexander waged war against Darius, and overcame him, and made himself
master of the whole sovereignty, after routing and destroying his camp. Then, after the exaltation
of the he-goat, his horn—the great one, namely—was broken; and there arose four
horns under it, toward the four winds of heaven. For, when Alexander had made himself
master of all the land of Persia, and had reduced its people into subjection, he thereupon
died, after dividing his kingdom into four principalities, as has been shown above. And from
that time “one horn was exalted, and waxed great, even to the power of heaven; and by him
the sacrifice,” he says, “was disturbed, and righteousness cast down to the ground.”</p>
<p>10. For Antiochus arose, surnamed Epiphanes, who was of the line of Alexander. And
after he had reigned in Syria, and brought under him all Egypt, he went up to Jerusalem,
and entered the sanctuary, and seized all the treasures in the house of the Lord, and the
golden candlestick, and the table, and the altar, and made a great slaughter in the land; even
as it is written: “And the sanctuary shall be trodden under foot, unto evening and unto
morning, a thousand and three hundred days.” For it happened that the sanctuary remained
desolate during that period, three years and a half, that the thousand and three hundred
days might be fulfilled; until Judas Maccabæus arose after the death of his father Matthias,
and withstood him, and destroyed the encampment of Antiochus, and delivered the city,
and recovered the sanctuary, and restored it in strict accordance with the law.</p>
<p>11. Since, then, the angel Gabriel also recounted these things to the prophet, as they
have been understood by us, as they have also taken place, and as they have been all clearly
described in the books of the Maccabees, let us see further what he says on the other weeks.
For when he read the book of Jeremiah the prophet, in which it was written that the sanctuary
would be desolate seventy years, he made confession with fastings and supplications, and
prayed that the people might return sooner from their captivity to the city Jerusalem. Thus,
then, he speaks in his account: “In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed
of the Medes, who was king over the realm of the Chaldeans, I Daniel understood in the
books the number of the years, as the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah the prophet,
for the accomplishment of the desolation of Jerusalem in seventy years,” etc.</p>
<p>12. After his confession and supplication, the angel says to him, “Thou art a man1303
greatly beloved:” for thou desirest to see things of which thou shalt be informed by me; and
<note type="footnote">1303 Literally, “a man of desires.” [Our author plays on this word, as if the desire of knowledge were referred
to. Our Authorized Version is better, and the rendering might be “a man of loves.”]</note>

in their own time these things will be fulfilled; and he touched me, saying, “Seventy weeks
are determined upon thy people, and upon the holy city, to seal up sins and to blot out
transgressions, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy; and thou
shalt know and understand, that from the going forth of words for the answer, and for the
building of Jerusalem, unto Christ the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two
weeks.”</p>
<p>13. Having mentioned therefore seventy weeks, and having divided them into two parts,
in order that what was spoken by him to the prophet might be better understood, he proceeds
thus, “Unto Christ the Prince shall be seven weeks,” which make forty-nine years. It was in
the twenty-first year that Daniel saw these things in Babylon. Hence, the forty-nine years
added to the twenty-one, make up the seventy years, of which the blessed Jeremiah spake:
“The sanctuary shall be desolate seventy years from the captivity that befell them under
Nebuchadnezzar; and after these things the people will return, and sacrifice and offering
will be presented, when Christ is their Prince.”1304</p>
<p>14. Now of what Christ does he speak, but of Jesus the son of Josedech, who returned
at that time along with the people, and offered sacrifice according to the law, in the seventieth
year, when the sanctuary was built? For all the kings and priests were styled Christs, because
they were anointed with the holy oil, which Moses of old prepared. These, then, bore the
name of the Lord in their own persons, showing aforetime the type, and presenting the
image until the perfect King and Priest appeared from heaven, who alone did the will of the
Father; as also it is written in Kings: “And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
all things according to my heart.”1305</p>
<p>15. In order, then, to show the time when He is to come whom the blessed Daniel desired
to see, he says, “And after seven weeks there are other threescore and two weeks,” which
period embraces the space of 434 years. For after the return of the people from Babylon
under the leadership of Jesus the son of Josedech, and Ezra the scribe, and Zerubbabel the
son of Salathiel, of the tribe of David, there were 434 years unto the coming of Christ, in
order that the Priest of priests might be manifested in the world, and that He who taketh
away the sins of the world might be evidently set forth, as John speaks concerning Him:
“Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!”1306 And in like manner
Gabriel says: “To blot out transgressions, and make reconciliation for sins.” But who has
blotted out our transgressions? Paul the apostle teaches us, saying, “He is our peace who
made both one;”1307 and then, “Blotting out the handwriting of sins that was against us.”1308</p>
<note type="footnote">1304 Jer. xxv. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">1305 1 Sam. ii. 35.</note>
<note type="footnote">1306 John i. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">1307 Eph. ii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">1308 Col. ii. 14.</note>

<pb n="458"/>
<p>16. That transgressions, therefore, are blotted out, and that reconciliation is made for
sins, is shown by this. But who are they who have reconciliation made for their sins, but
they who believe on His name, and propitiate His countenance by good works? And that
after the return of the people from Babylon there was a space of 434 years, until the time of
the birth of Christ, may be easily understood. For, since the first covenant was given to the
children of Israel after a period of 434 years, it follows that the second covenant also should
be defined by the same space of time, in order that it might be expected by the people and
easily recognised by the faithful.</p>
<p>17. And for this reason Gabriel says: “And to anoint the Most Holy.” And the Most
Holy is none else but the Son of God alone, who, when He came and manifested Himself,
said to them, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me;”1309 and so
forth. Whosoever, therefore, believed on the heavenly Priest, were cleansed by that same
Priest, and their sins were blotted out. And whosoever believed not on Him, despising Him
as a man, had their sins sealed, as those which could not be taken away; whence the angel,
foreseeing that not all should believe on Him, said, “To finish sins, and to seal up sins.” For
as many as continued to disbelieve Him, even to the end, had their sins not finished, but
sealed to be kept for judgment. But as many as will believe on Him as One able to remit
sins, have their sins blotted out. Wherefore he says: “And to seal up vision and prophet.”</p>
<p>18. For when He came who is the fulfilling of the law and of the prophets (for the law
and the prophets were till John), it was necessary that the things spoken by them should be
confirmed (sealed), in order that at the coming of the Lord all things loosed should be
brought to light, and that things bound of old should now be loosed by Him, as the Lord
said Himself to the rulers of the people, when they were indignant at the cure on the Sabbathday:
“Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead
him away to watering? and ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom
Satan hath bound these eighteen years, be loosed on the Sabbath-day?”1310 Whomsoever,
therefore, Satan bound in chains, these did the Lord on His coming loose from the bonds
of death, having bound our strong adversary and delivered humanity. As also Isaiah says:
“Then will He say to those in chains, Go forth; and to them that are in darkness, Show
yourselves.”1311</p>
<p>19. And that the things spoken of old by the law and the prophets were all sealed, and
that they were unknown to men, Isaiah declares when he says: “And they will deliver the
book that is sealed to one that is learned, and will say to him, Read this; and he will say, I
cannot read it, for it is sealed.”1312 It was meet and necessary that the things spoken of old

<pb n="459"/>
The interpretation by Hippolytus, (bishop) of Rome, of the visions of Daniel…
by the prophets should be sealed to the unbelieving Pharisees, who thought that they understood
the letter of the law, and be opened to the believing. The things, therefore, which of
old were sealed, are now by the grace of God the Lord all open to the saints.</p>
<p>20. For He was Himself the perfect Seal, and the Church is the key: “He who openeth,
and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth,”1313 as John says. And again, the
same says: “And I saw, on the right hand of Him that sat on the throne, a book written
within and without, sealed with seven seals; and I saw an angel proclaiming with a loud
voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?” and so forth. “And
I beheld in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, a Lamb standing slain, having
seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne. And
when He had taken the book, the four beasts and four-and-twenty elders fell down before
the Lamb, having harps and golden vials full of incense, which is the prayers of the saints.
And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals
thereof: for Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood.”1314 He took the
book, therefore, and loosed it, in order that the things spoken concerning Him of old in
secret, might now be proclaimed with boldness upon the house-tops.1315</p>
<p>21. For this reason, then, the angel says to Daniel, “Seal the words, for the vision is until
the end of the time.” But to Christ it was not said “seal,” but “loose” the things bound of
old; in order that, by His grace, we might know the will of the Father, and believe upon Him
whom He has sent for the salvation of men, Jesus our Lord. He says, therefore, “They shall
return, and the street shall be built, and the wall;” which in reality took place. For the people
returned and built the city, and the temple, and the wall round about. Then he says: “After
threescore and two weeks the times will be fulfilled, and one week will make a covenant
with many; and in the midst (half) of the week sacrifice and oblation will be removed, and
in the temple will be the abomination of desolations.”</p>
<p>22. For when the threescore and two weeks are fulfilled, and Christ is come, and the
Gospel is preached in every place, the times being then accomplished, there will remain
only one week, the last, in which Elias will appear, and Enoch, and in the midst of it the
abomination of desolation will be manifested,1316 viz., Antichrist, announcing desolation
to the world. And when he comes, the sacrifice and oblation will be removed, which now
are offered to God in every place by the nations. These things being thus recounted, the

<pb n="460"/>
prophet again describes another vision to us. For he had no other care save to be accurately
instructed in all things that are to be, and to prove himself an instructor in such.</p>
<p>23. He says then: “In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a word was revealed unto
Daniel, whose name was Belshazzar; and the word was true, and great power and understanding
were given him in the vision. In those days I Daniel was mourning three weeks of
days. I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I
anoint myself at all, till three weeks of days were fulfilled. On the fourth day of the first
month I humbled myself,” says he, “one and twenty days,” praying to the living God, and
asking of Him the revelation of the mystery. And the Father in truth heard me, and sent His
own Word, to show what should happen by Him. And that took place, indeed, by the great
river. For it was meet that the Son should be manifested there, where also He was to remove
sins.</p>
<p>24. “And I lifted up mine eyes,” he says, “and, behold, a man clothed in linen.”1317 In
the first vision he says, “Behold, the angel Gabriel (was) sent.” Here, however, it is not so;
but he sees the Lord, not yet indeed as perfect man, but with the appearance and form of
man, as he says: “And, behold, a man clothed in linen.” For in being clothed in a variouscoloured
coat, he indicated mystically1318 the variety of the graces of our calling. For the
priestly coat was made up of different colours, as various nations waited for Christ’s coming,
in order that we might be made up (as one body) of many colours. “And his loins were
girded with the gold of Ophaz.”</p>
<p>25. Now the word “Ophaz,” which is a word transferred from Hebrew to Greek, denotes
pure gold. With a pure girdle, therefore, he was girded round the loins. For the Word was
to bear us all, binding us like a girdle round His body, in His own love. The complete body
was His,1319 but we are members in His body, united together, and sustained by the Word
Himself. “And his body was like Tharses.”1320 Now “Tharses,” by interpretation, is
“Ethiopians.” For that it would be difficult to recognise Him, the prophet had thus already
announced beforehand, intimating that He would be manifested in the flesh in the world,
but that many would find it difficult to recognise Him. “And his face as lightning, and his
eyes as lamps of fire;” for it was meet that the fiery and judicial power of the Word should
be signified aforetime, in the exercise of which He will cause the fire (of His judgment) to
light with justice upon the impious, and consume them.</p>

<pb n="461"/>
<p>26. He added also these words: “And his arms and his feet like polished brass;” to denote
the first calling of men, and the second calling like unto it, viz. of the Gentiles.1321 “For the
last shall be as the first; for I will set thy rulers as at the beginning, and thy leaders as before.
And His voice was as the voice of a great multitude.”1322 For all we who believe on Him in
these days utter things oracular, as speaking by His mouth the things appointed by Him.</p>
<p>27. And after a little He says to him: “Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? And
now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia. But I will show thee that which is noted
in the Scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but Michael
your prince, and I left him there. For from the day that thou didst give thy countenance to
be afflicted before the Lord thy God, thy prayer was heard, and I was sent to fight with the
prince of Persia:” for a certain counsel was formed not to send the people away: “that
therefore thy prayer might be speedily granted, I withstood him, and left Michael there.”</p>
<p>28. And who was he that spake, but the angel who was given to the people, as he says
in the law of Moses: “I will not go with you, because the people is stiff-necked; but my angel
shall go before along with you?”1323 This (angel) withstood Moses at the inn, when he was
bringing the child uncircumcised into Egypt. For it was not allowed Moses, who was the
elder (or legate) and mediator of the law, and who proclaimed the covenant of the fathers,
to introduce a child uncircumcised, lest he should be deemed a false prophet and deceiver
by the people. “And now,” says he, “will I show the truth to thee.” Could the Truth have
shown anything else but the truth?</p>
<p>29. He says therefore to him: “Behold, there shall stand up three kings in Persia: and
the fourth shall be far richer than they all; and when he has got possession of his riches, he
shall stand up against all the realms of Grecia. And a mighty king shall stand up, and shall
rule with great dominion, and do according to his will; and when his kingdom stands, it
shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven.” These things we
have already discussed above, when we discoursed upon the four beasts. But since Scripture
now again sets them forth explicitly, we must also discourse upon them a second time, that
we may not leave Scripture unused and unexplained.</p>
<p>30. “There shall stand up yet three kings,” he says, “in Persia; and the fourth shall be far
richer than they all.” This has been fulfilled. For after Cyrus arose Darius, and then Artaxerxes.
These were the three kings; (and) the Scripture is fulfilled. “And the fourth shall be far
richer than they all.” Who is that but Darius, who reigned and made himself glorious,—who
was rich, and assailed all the realms of Greece? Against him rose Alexander of Macedon,
who destroyed his kingdom; and after he had reduced the Persians, his own kingdom was

<pb n="462"/>
divided toward the four winds of heaven. For Alexander at his death divided his kingdom
into four principalities. “And a king shall stand up, and shall enter into the fortress of the
king of Egypt.”</p>
<p>31. For Antiochus became king of Syria. He held the sovereignty in the 107th year of
the kingdom of the Greeks. And in those same times indeed he made war against Ptolemy
king of Egypt, and conquered him, and won the power. On returning from Egypt he went
up to Jerusalem, in the 103d year, and carrying off with him all the treasures of the Lord’s
house, he marched to Antioch. And after two years of days the king sent his raiser of taxes1324
into the cities of Judea, to compel the Jews to forsake the laws of their fathers, and submit
to the decrees of the king. And he came, and tried to compel them, saying, “Come forth,
and do the commandment of the king, and ye shall live.”</p>
<p>32. But they said, “We will not come forth: neither will we do the king’s commandment;
we will die in our innocency: and he slew of them a thousand souls.”1325 The things, therefore,
which were spoken to the blessed Daniel are fulfilled: “And my servants shall be afflicted,
and shall fall by famine, and by sword, and by captivity.”1326 Daniel, however, adds: “And
they shall be holpen with a little help.” For at that time Matthias arose, and Judas Maccabæus,
and helped them, and delivered them from the hand of the Greeks.</p>
<p>33. That therefore was fulfilled which was spoken in the Scripture. He proceeds then
thus: “And the (king’s) daughter of the South shall come to the king of the North to make
an agreement with him; and the arms of him that bringeth her shall not stand; and she, too,
shall be smitten, and shall fall, and he that bringeth her.” For this was a certain Ptolemaïs,1327
queen of Egypt. At that time indeed she went forth with her two sons, Ptolemy and Philometor,
to make an agreement with Antiochus king of Syria; and when she came to Scythopolis,
she was slain there. For he who brought her betrayed her. At that same time, the two
brothers made war against each other, and Philometor was slain, and Ptolemy gained the
power.</p>
<p>34. War, then, was again made by Ptolemy against Antiochus, (and) Antiochus met
him. For thus saith the Scripture: “And the king of the South shall stand up against the king
of the North, and her seed shall stand up against him.” And what seed but Ptolemy, who
made war with Antiochus? And Antiochus having gone forth against him, and having failed
to overcome him, had to flee, and returned to Antioch, and collected a larger host. Ptolemy
accordingly took his whole equipment, and carried it into Egypt. And the Scripture is fulfilled,
<note type="footnote">1324 φορολόγον.</note>
<note type="footnote">1325 1 Macc. ii. 33.</note>
<note type="footnote">1326 Dan. xi. 33.</note>
<note type="footnote">1327 He seems to refer to Cleopatra, wife and niece of Physco. For Lathyrus was sometimes called Philometor
in ridicule (ἐπὶ χλευασμᾷ), as Pausanias says in the Attica.</note>

<pb n="463"/>
as Daniel says: And he shall carry off into Egypt their gods, and their cast-works, and all
their precious (vessels of) gold.</p>
<p>35. And after these things Antiochus went forth a second time to make war against him,
and overcome Ptolemy. And after these events Antiochus commenced hostilities again
against the children of Israel, and despatched one Nicanor with a large army to subdue the
Jews, at the time when Judas, after the death of Matthias, ruled the people; and so forth, as
is written in the Maccabees. These events having taken place, the Scripture says again: “And
there shall stand up another king, and he shall prevail upon the earth; and the king of the
South shall stand up, and he shall obtain his daughter to wife.”</p>
<p>36. For it happened that there arose a certain Alexander,1328 son of Philip. He withstood
Antiochus1329 at that time, and made war upon him, and cut him off, and gained possession
of the kingdom. Then he sent to Ptolemy king of Egypt, saying, Give me thy daughter
Cleopatra to wife. And he gave her to Alexander to wife. And thus the Scripture is fulfilled,
when it says: “And he shall obtain his daughter to wife.” And it says further: “And he shall
corrupt her, and she shall not be his wife.” This also has been truly fulfilled. For after Ptolemy
had given him his daughter, he returned, and saw the mighty and glorious kingdom of Alexander.
And coveting its possession, he spoke falsely to Alexander, as the Scripture says:
“And the two kings shall speak lies at (one) table.” And, in sooth, Ptolemy betook himself
to Egypt, and collected a great army, and attacked the city at the time when Alexander had
marched into Cilicia.</p>
<p>37. Ptolemy then invaded the country, and established garrisons throughout the cities;
and on making himself master of Judea, set out for his daughter, and sent letters to Demetrius
in the islands, saying, Come and meet me here, and I will give thee my daughter Cleopatra
to wife, for Alexander has sought to kill me. Demetrius came accordingly, and Ptolemy
received him, and gave him her who had been destined for Alexander. Thus is fulfilled that
which is written: “And he shall corrupt her, and she shall not be his wife.” Alexander was
slain. Then Ptolemy wore two crowns, that of Syria and that of Egypt, and died the third
day after he had assumed them. Thus is fulfilled that which is written in Scripture: “And
they shall not give him the glory of the kingdom.” For he died, and received not honour
from all as king.</p>
<note type="footnote">1328 He refers to Alexander I. king of Syria, of whom we read in 1 Macc. x. He pretended to be the son of
Antiochus Epiphanes, and even gained a decree of the senate of Rome in his favour as such. Yet he was a person
of unknown origin, as indeed he acknowledged himself in his choice of the designation Theopator. Livy calls
him “a man unknown, and of uncertain parentage” (homo ignotus et incertæ stirpis). So Hippolytus calls him
here, “a certain Alexander” (τινα). He had also other surnames, e.g., Euergetes, Balas, etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">1329 For “Antiochus” in the text, read “Demetrius.”</note>

<pb n="464"/>
<p>38. The prophet then, after thus recounting the things which have taken place already,
and been fulfilled in their times, declares yet another mystery to us, while he points out the
last times. For he says: “And there shall rise up another shameless king; and he shall exalt
himself above every god, and shall magnify himself, and shall speak marvellous things, and
shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished;” and so forth. “And these shall escape
out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief (or principality) of the children of Ammon.
And he shall stretch forth his hand upon the land; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
And he shall have power over the secret treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious
things of Egypt and of the Libyans, and the Ethiopians in their strongholds.”</p>
<p>39. Thus, then, does the prophet set forth these things concerning the Antichrist, who
shall be shameless, a war-maker, and despot, who, exalting himself above all kings and above
every god, shall build the city of Jerusalem, and restore the sanctuary. Him the impious will
worship as God, and will bend to him the knee, thinking him to be the Christ. He shall cut
off the two witnesses and forerunners of Christ, who proclaim His glorious kingdom from
heaven, as it is said: “And I will give (power) unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy
a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.”1330 As also it was announced
to Daniel: “And one week shall confirm a covenant with many; and in the midst
of the week it shall be that the sacrifice and oblation shall be removed”—that the one week
might be shown to be divided into two. The two witnesses, then, shall preach three years
and a half; and Antichrist shall make war upon the saints during the rest of the week, and
desolate the world, that what is written may be fulfilled: “And they shall make the abomination
of desolation for a thousand two hundred and ninety days.”</p>
<p>40. Daniel has spoken, therefore, of two abominations; the one of destruction, and the
other of desolation. What is that of destruction, but that which Antiochus established there
at the time? And what is that of desolation, but that which shall be universal when Antichrist
comes? “And there shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the
children of Ammon.” For these are they who ally themselves with him on account of their
kinship, and first address him as king. Those of Edom are the sons of Esau, who inhabit
Mount Seir. And Moab and Ammon are they who are descended from his two daughters,
as Isaiah also says: “And they shall fly (extend themselves) in the ships of strangers, and they
shall also plunder the sea; and those from the east, and from the west, and the north, shall
give them honour: and the children of Ammon shall first obey them.”1331 He shall be proclaimed
king by them, and shall be magnified by all, and shall prove himself an abomination
<note type="footnote">1330 Apoc. xi. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">1331 Isa. xi. 14.</note>

<pb n="465"/>
of desolation to the world, and shall reign for a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
“Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty
days;” for when the abomination cometh and makes war upon the saints, whosoever shall
survive his days, and reach the forty-five days, while the other period of fifty days advances,
to him the kingdom of heaven comes. Antichrist, indeed, enters even into part of the fifty
days, but the saints shall inherit the kingdom along with Christ.</p>
<p>41. These things being thus narrated, Daniel proceeds: “And, behold, there stood two
men, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side; and they made
answer to the man that stood upon the bank of the river, and said to him, How long shall
it be to the end of these wonderful words which thou hast spoken? And I heard the man
clothed in linen, who was upon the water of the river; and he lifted up his right hand and
his left hand unto heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever, that it shall be for a time,
times, and an half; and they shall know all these things when the dispersion is accomplished.”</p>
<p>42. Who, then, were the two men who stood on the bank of the river, but the law and
the prophets? And who was he who stood upon the water, but He concerning whom they
prophesied of old, who in the last times was to be borne witness to by the Father at the
Jordan, and to be declared to the people boldly by John, “who wore the casty1332 of the
scribe about his loins, and was clothed with a linen coat of various colours?” These, therefore,
interrogate Him, knowing that to Him were given all government and power, in order to
learn accurately of Him when He will bring the judgment on the world, and when the things
spoken by Him will be fulfilled. And He, desiring by all means to convince them, lifted His
right hand and His left hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever. Who is He
that swore, and by whom sware He? Manifestly the Son by the Father, saying, The Father
liveth for ever, but in a time, and times, and an half, when the dispersion is accomplished,
they shall know all these things.</p>
<p>43. By the stretching forth of His two hands He signified His passion; and by mentioning
“a time, and times, and an half, when the dispersion is accomplished,” He indicated the
three years and a half of Antichrist. For by “a time” He means a year, and by “times” two
years, and by an “half time” half a year. These are the thousand two hundred and ninety
days of which Daniel prophesied for the finishing of the passion, and the accomplishment
of the dispersion when Antichrist comes. In those days they shall know all these things. And
from the time of the removal of the continuous sacrifice there are also reckoned one thousand
two hundred and ninety days. (Then) iniquity shall abound, as the Lord also says: “Because
iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”1333</p>
<note type="footnote">1332 Girdle.</note>
<note type="footnote">1333 Matt. xxiv. 12.</note>

<pb n="466"/>
<p>44. And that divisions will arise when the falling away takes place, is without doubt.
And when divisions arise, love is chilled. The words, “Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh
to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days,” have also their value, as the Lord
said: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” Wherefore let us by
no means admit the falling away, lest iniquity abound, and the abomination of desolation—
that is, the adversary—overtake us. And He said to him, “unto evening”—that is,
unto the consummation—“and morning.” What is “morning?” The day of resurrection. For
that is the beginning of another age, as the morning is the beginning of the day. And the
thousand and four hundred days are the light of the world. For on the appearing of the light
in the world (as He says, “I am the light of the world”), the sanctuary shall be purged, as he
said,1334 (of) the adversary. For it cannot by any means be purged but by his destruction.</p>

<p>Scholia on Daniel.1335</p>
<p>Chap. i. 1 “In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim.” The Scripture narrates these
things, with the purpose of intimating the second captivity of the people, when Jehoiakim
and the three youths with him, together with Daniel, were taken captive and carried off.</p>
<p>2. “And the Lord gave,” etc. These words, “and the Lord gave,” are written, that no one,
in reading the introduction to the book, may attribute their capture to the strength of the
captors and the slackness of their chief. And it is well said, “with part,” for the deportation
was for the correction, not the ruin, of the whole nation, that there might be no misapplication
of the cause.</p>
<p>8. “And Daniel purposed in his heart.” Oh, blessed are they who thus kept the covenant
of the fathers, and transgressed not the law given by Moses, but feared the God proclaimed
by him. These, though captives in a strange land, were not seduced by delicate meats, nor
were they slaves to the pleasures of wine, nor were they caught by the bait of princely glory.
But they kept their mouth holy and pure, that pure speech might proceed from pure mouths,
and praise with such (mouths) the heavenly Father.</p>
<p>12. “Prove now thy servants.” They teach that it is not earthly meats that give to men
their beauty and strength, but the grace of God bestowed by the Word. “And after a little.”
Thou hast seen the incorruptible faith of the youths, and the unalterable fear of God. They
asked an interval of ten days, to prove therein that man cannot otherwise find grace with
God than by believing the word preached by the Lord.</p>
<p>19. “And among them all, was found none like Daniel.” These men, who were proved
faithful witnesses in Babylon, were led by the Word in all wisdom, that by their means the
idols of the Babylonians should be put to shame, and that Nebuchadnezzar should be
overcome by three youths, and that by their faith the fire in the furnace should be kept at
bay, and the desire of the wicked elders (or chiefs) proved vain.</p>
<p>Chap. ii. 3 “I have dreamed a dream.” The dream, then, which was seen by the king was
not an earthly dream, so that it might be interpreted by the wise of the world; but it was a
heavenly dream, fulfilled in its proper times, according to the counsel and foreknowledge
of God. And for this reason it was kept secret from men who think of earthly things, that
to those who seek after heavenly things heavenly mysteries might be revealed. And, indeed,
there was a similar case in Egypt in the time of Pharaoh and Joseph.</p>
<p>5. “The thing is gone from me.” For this purpose was the vision concealed from the
king, that he who was chosen of God., viz., Daniel, might be shown to be a prophet. For
<note type="footnote">1335 Mai, Script. vet. collectio nova, i. p. iii. pp. 29–56.</note>

<pb n="468"/>
when things concealed from some are revealed by another, he who tells them is of necessity
shown to be a prophet.</p>
<p>10. “And they say, There is not a man.” Whereas, therefore, they declared it to be impossible
that what was asked by the king should be told by man; God showed them, that
what is impossible with man is possible with God.</p>
<p>14. “Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard” (literally, “the chief slaughterer or cook”).
For as the cook slays all animals and cooks them, of a similar nature was his occupation.
And the rulers of the world slay men, butchering them like brute beasts.</p>
<p>23. “Because Thou hast given me wisdom and might.” We ought therefore to mark the
goodness of God, how He straightway reveals and shows (Himself) to the worthy, and to
those that fear Him, fulfilling their prayers and supplications, as the prophet says: “Who is
wise, and he shall understand these things? and prudent, and he shall know them?”1336</p>
<p>27. “Cannot the wise men, the magicians.” He instructs the king not to seek an explanation
of heavenly mysteries from earthly men, for they shall be accomplished in their due
time by God.</p>
<p>29. “As for thee, O king, thy thoughts.” For the king, on making himself master of the
land of Egypt, and getting hold of the country of Judea, and carrying off the people, thought
upon his bed what should be after these things; and He who knows the secrets of all, and
searcheth the thoughts of the hearts, revealed to him by means of the image the things that
were to be. And He hid from him the vision, in order that the counsels of God might not
be interpreted by the wise men of Babylon, but that by the blessed Daniel, as a prophet of
God, things kept secret from all might be made manifest.</p>
<p>31. “Behold a great image.” How, then, should we not mark the things prophesied of
old in Babylon by Daniel, and now yet in the course of fulfilment in the world? For the image
shown at that time to Nebuchadnezzar furnished a type of the whole world. In these times
the Babylonians were sovereign over all, and these were the golden head of the image. And
then, after them, the Persians held the supremacy for 245 years, and they were represented
by the silver. Then the Greeks had the supremacy, beginning with Alexander of Macedon,
for 300 years, so that they were the brass. After them came the Romans, who were the iron
legs of the image, for they were strong as iron. Then (we have) the toes of clay and iron, to
signify the democracies that were subsequently to rise, partitioned among the ten toes of
the image, in which shall be iron mixed with clay.</p>
<p>31. “Thou sawest,” etc. Apollinaris on this: He looked, and behold, as it were, an image.
For it did not appear to him as an actual object, presented to the view of an onlooker, but
as an image or semblance. And while it contains in it many things together, that is in such
a way that it is not really one, but manifold. For it comprised a summary of all kingdoms;
<note type="footnote">1336 Hos. xiv. 9.</note>

<pb n="469"/>
and its exceeding splendour was on account of the glory of the kings, and its terrible appearance
on account of their power. Eusebius Pamphili, and Hippolytus the most holy bishop
of Rome, compare the dream of Nebuchadnezzar now in question with the vision of the
prophet Daniel. Since these have given a different interpretation of this vision now before
us in their expositions, I deemed it necessary to transcribe what is said by Eusebius of
Cæsarea, who bears the surname Pamphili, in the 15th book of his Gospel Demonstration;1337
for he expounds the whole vision in these terms: “I think that this (i.e., the vision of
Nebuchadnezzar) differs in nothing from the vision of the prophet. For as the prophet saw
a great sea, so the king saw a great image. And again, as the prophet saw four beasts, which
he interpreted as four kingdoms, so the king was given to understand four kingdoms under
the gold, and silver, and brass, and iron. And again, as the prophet saw the division of the
ten horns of the last beast, and three horns broken by one; so the king, in like manner, saw
in the extremities of the image one part iron and another clay. And besides this, as the
prophet, after the vision of the four kingdoms, saw the Son of man receive dominion, and
power, and a kingdom; so also the king thought he saw a stone smite the whole image, and
become a great mountain and fill the sea. And rightly so. For it was quite consistent in the
king, whose view of the spectacle of life was so false, and who admired the beauty of the
mere sensible colours, so to speak, in the picture set up to view, to liken the life of all men
to a great image; but (it became) the prophet to compare the great and mighty tumult of
life to a mighty sea. And it was fitting that the king, who prized the substances deemed
precious among men, gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, should liken to these substances
the kingdoms that held the sovereignty at different times in the life of men; but that the
prophet should describe these same kingdoms under the likeness of beasts, in accordance
with the manner of their rule. And again, the king—who was puffed up, as it seems, in his
own conceit, and plumed himself on the power of his ancestors—is shown the vicissitude
to which affairs are subject, and the end destined for all the kingdoms of earth, with the
view of teaching him to lay aside his pride in himself, and understand that there is nothing
stable among men, but only that which is the appointed end of all things—the kingdom of
God. For after the first kingdom of the Assyrians, which was denoted by the gold, there will
be the second kingdom of the Persians, expressed by the silver; and then the third kingdom
of the Macedonians, signified by the brass; and after it, the fourth kingdom of the Romans
will succeed, more powerful than those that went before it; for which reason also it was
likened to iron. For of it is said: “And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; as iron
breaketh and subdueth all things, so shall it break and subdue all things.” And after all these
kingdoms which have been mentioned, the kingdom of God is represented by the stone that
breaks the whole image. And the prophet, in conformity with this, does not see the kingdom
<note type="footnote">1337 This book is not now extant, the first ten alone having reached our time.</note>

<pb n="470"/>
which comes at the end of all these things, until he has in order described the four dominions
mentioned under the four beasts. And I think that the visions shown, both to the king and
to the prophet, were visions of these four kingdoms alone, and of none others, because by
these the nation of the Jews was held in bondage from the times of the prophet.”</p>
<p>33. “His feet,” etc. Hippolytus: In the vision of the prophet, the ten horns are the things
that are yet to be.</p>
<p>34. “Thou sawest till that a stone was cut.” Thou sawest, as it were, a stone cut without
hands, and smiting the image upon its feet. For the human kingdom was decisively separated
from the divine; with reference to which it is written, “as it were cut.” The stroke, however,
smites the extremities, and in these it broke all dominion that is upon earth.</p>
<p>45. “And the dream is certain.” That no one, therefore, may have any doubt whether
the things announced shall turn out so or not, the prophet has confirmed them with the
words, “And the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure;” I have not erred in
the interpretation of the vision.</p>
<p>46. “Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face.” Nebuchadnezzar hearing these
things, and being put in remembrance of his vision, knew that what was spoken by Daniel
was true. How great is the power of the grace of God, beloved, that one who a little before
was doomed to death with the other wise men of Babylon, should now be worshipped by
the king, not as man, but as God! “He commanded that they should offer manaa”1338 (i.e.,
in Chaldee, “oblation”) “and sweet odours unto him.” Of old, too, the Lord made a similar
announcement to Moses, saying, “See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh;”1339 in order
that, on account of the signs wrought by him in the land of Egypt, Moses might no longer
be reckoned a man, but be worshipped as a god by the Egyptians.</p>
<p>48. “Then the king made Daniel a great man.” For as he had humbled himself, and
presented himself as the least among all men, God made him great, and the king established
him as ruler over the whole land of Babylon. Just as also Pharaoh did to Joseph, appointing
him then to be ruler over the whole land of Egypt.</p>
<p>49. “And Daniel requested,” etc. For as they had united with Daniel in prayer to God
that the vision might be revealed to him, so Daniel, when he obtained great honour from
the king, made mention of them, explaining to the king what had been done by them, in
order that they also should be deemed worthy of some honour as fellow-seers and worshippers
of God. For when they asked heavenly things from the Lord, they received also earthly
things from the king.</p>
<p>Chap. iii. 1 “In the eighteenth year,” etc. (These words are wanting in the Vulgate, etc.)
A considerable space of time having elapsed, therefore, and the eighteenth year being now
<note type="footnote">1338 [The minchah, that is.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1339 Ex. vii. 1.</note>

<pb n="471"/>
in its course, the king, calling to mind his vision, “made an image of gold, whose height was
threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits.” For as the blessed Daniel, in interpreting
the vision, had answered the king, saying, “Thou art this head of gold in the image,” the
king, being puffed up with this address, and elated in heart, made a copy of this image, in
order that he might be worshipped by all as God.</p>
<p>7. “All the people fell.” Some (did so) because they feared the king himself; but all (or
“most”), because they were idolaters, obeyed the word commanded by the king.</p>
<p>16. “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered,” etc. These three youths are become
an example to all faithful men, inasmuch as they did not fear the crowd of satraps, neither
did they tremble when they heard the king’s words, nor did they shrink when they saw the
flame of the blazing furnace, but deemed all men and the whole world as nought, and kept
the fear of God alone before their eyes. Daniel, though he stood at a distance and kept silence,
encouraged them to be of good cheer as he smiled to them. And he rejoiced also himself at
the witness they bore, understanding, as he did, that the three youths would receive a crown
in triumph over the devil.</p>
<p>19. “And commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more.” He bids
the vast furnace be heated one seven times more, as if he were already overcome by them.
In earthly things, then, the king was superior; but in faith toward God the three youths were
superior. Tell me, Nebuchadnezzar, with what purpose you order them to be cast into the
fire bound? Is it lest they might escape, if they should have their feet unbound, and thus be
able to extinguish the fire? But thou doest not these things of thyself, but there is another
who worketh these things by thy means.</p>
<p>47.1340 “And the flame streamed forth.” The fire, he means, was driven from within by
the angel, and burst forth outwardly. See how even the fire appears intelligent, as if it recognised
and punished the guilty. For it did not touch the servants of God, but it consumed
the unbelieving and impious Chaldeans. Those who were within were besprinkled with a
(cooling) dew by the angel, while those who thought they stood in safety outside the furnace
were destroyed by the fire. The men who cast in the youths were burned by the flame, which
caught them on all sides, as I suppose, when they went to bind the youths.</p>
<p>92 (i.e., 25). “And the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.” Tell me, Nebuchadnezzar,
when didst thou see the Son of God, that thou shouldst confess that this is the Son of
God? And who pricked thy heart, that thou shouldst utter such a word? And with what eyes
wert thou able to look into this light? And why was this manifested to thee alone, and to
none of the satraps about thee? But, as it is written, “The heart of a king is in the hand of
God:” the hand of God is here, whereby the Word pricked his heart, so that he might recog-
<note type="footnote">1340 The verses are numbered according to the Greek translation, which incorporates the apocryphal “song
of the three holy children.”</note>

<pb n="472"/>
nise Him in the furnace, and glorify Him. And this idea of ours is not without good ground.
For as the children of Israel were destined to see God in the world, and yet not to believe
on Him, the Scripture showed beforehand that the Gentiles would recognise Him incarnate,
whom, while not incarnate, Nebuchadnezzar saw and recognised of old in the furnace, and
acknowledged to be the Son of God.</p>
<p>93 (i.e., 26). “And he said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.” The three youths he
thus called by name. But he found no name by which to call the fourth. For He was not yet
that Jesus born of the Virgin.</p>
<p>97 (i.e., 30). “Then the king promoted,” etc. For as they honoured God by giving themselves
up to death, so, too, they were themselves honoured not only by God, but also by the
king. And they taught strange and foreign nations also to worship God.</p>
<p>Chap. vii. 1 “And he wrote the dream.” The things, therefore, which were revealed to
the blessed prophet by the Spirit in visions, these he also recounted fully for others, that he
might not appear to prophesy of the future to himself alone, but might be proved a prophet
to others also, who wish to search the divine Scriptures.</p>
<p>2. “And behold the four winds.” He means created existence in its fourfold division.</p>
<p>3. “And four great beasts.” As various beasts then were shown to the blessed Daniel,
and these different from each other, we should understand that the truth of the narrative
deals not with certain beasts, but, under the type and image of different beasts, exhibits the
kingdoms that have risen in this world in power over the race of man. For by the great sea
he means the whole world.</p>
<p>4. “Till the wings thereof were plucked.” For this happened in reality in the time of
Nebuchadnezzar, as has been shown in the preceding book. And he bears witness directly
that this very thing was fulfilled in himself; for he was driven out of the kingdom, and
stripped of his glory, and of the greatness which he formerly possessed. “And after a little:”
the words, “It was made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it,”
signify that Nebuchadnezzar, when he humbled himself, and acknowledged that he was but
a man, in subjection under the power of God, and made supplication to the Lord, found
mercy with Him, and was restored to his own kingdom and honour.</p>
<p>5. “A second beast like to a bear.” To represent the kingdom of the Persians. “And it
had three ribs.” The three nations he calls three ribs. The meaning, therefore, is this: that
beast had the dominion, and these others under it were the Medes, Assyrians, and Babylonians.
“And they said thus to it, Arise, devour.” For the Persians arising in these times,
devastated every land, and made many men subject to them, and slew them. For as this
beast, the bear, is a foul animal, and carnivorous, tearing with claws and teeth, such also
was the kingdom of the Persians, who held the supremacy for two hundred and thirty years.</p>
<p>6. “And, lo, another beast like a leopard.” In mentioning a leopard, he means the kingdom
of the Greeks, over whom Alexander of Macedon was king. And he likened them to a leopard,

<pb n="473"/>
because they were quick and inventive in thought, and bitter in heart, just as that animal is
many-coloured in appearance, and quick in wounding and in drinking man’s blood.</p>
<p>“The beast had also four heads.” When the kingdom of Alexander was exalted, and
grew, and acquired a name over the whole world, his kingdom was divided into four principalities.
For Alexander, when near his end, partitioned his kingdom among his four
comrades of the same race, viz., “Seleucus, Demetrius, Ptolemy, and Philip;” and all these
assumed crowns, as Daniel prophesies, and as it is written in the first book of Maccabees.</p>
<p>7. “And behold a fourth beast.” Now, that there has arisen no other kingdom after that
of the Greeks except that which stands sovereign at present, is manifest to all. This one has
iron teeth, because it subdues and reduces all by its strength, just as iron does. And the rest
it did tread with its feet, for there is no other kingdom remaining after this one, but from it
will spring ten horns.</p>
<p>“And it had ten horns.” For as the prophet said already of the leopard, that the beast
had four heads, and that was fulfilled, and Alexander’s kingdom was divided into four
principalities, so also now we ought to look for the ten horns which are to spring from it,
when the time of the beast shall be fulfilled, and the little horn, which is Antichrist, shall
appear suddenly in their midst, and righteousness shall be banished from the earth, and the
whole world shall reach its consummation. So that we ought not to anticipate the counsel
of God, but exercise patience and prayer, that we fall not on such times. We should not,
however, refuse to believe that these things will come to pass. For if the things which the
prophets predicted in former times have not been realized, then we need not look for these
things. But if those former things did happen in their proper seasons, as was foretold, these
things also shall certainly be fulfilled.</p>
<p>8. “I considered the horns.” That is to say, I looked intently at the beast, and was astonished
at everything about it, but especially at the number of the horns. For the appearance
of this beast differed from that of the other beasts in kind.</p>
<p>13. “And came to the Ancient of days.” By the Ancient of days he means none other
than the Lord and God and Ruler of all, and even of Christ Himself, who maketh the days
old, and yet becometh not old Himself by times and days.</p>
<p>14. “His dominion is an everlasting dominion.” The Father, having put all things in
subjection to His own Son, both things in heaven and things on earth, showed Him forth
by all as the first-begotten of God, in order that, along with the Father, He might be approved
the Son of God before angels, and be manifested as the Lord also of angels: (He showed Him
forth also as) the first-begotten of a virgin, that He might be seen to be in Himself the Creator
anew of the first-formed Adam, (and) as the first-begotten from the dead, that He might
become Himself the first-fruits of our resurrection.</p>
<p>“Which shall not pass away.” He exhibited all the dominion given by the Father to His
own Son, who is manifested as King of all in heaven and on earth, and under the earth, and

<pb n="474"/>
as Judge of all: of all in heaven, because He was born the Word, of the heart of the Father
before all; and of all in earth, because He was made man, and created Adam anew of Himself;
and of all under the earth, because He was also numbered among the dead, and preached
to the souls of the saints, (and) by death overcame death.</p>
<p>17. “Which shall arise.” For when the three beasts have finished their course, and been
removed, and the one still stands in vigour,—if this one, too, is removed, then finally earthly
things (shall) end, and heavenly things begin; that the indissoluble and everlasting kingdom
of the saints may be brought to view, and the heavenly King manifested to all, no longer in
figure, like one seen in vision, or revealed in a pillar of cloud upon the top of a mountain,
but amid the powers and armies of angels, as God incarnate and man, Son of God and Son
of man—coming from heaven as the world’s Judge.</p>
<p>19. “And I inquired about the fourth beast.” It is to the fourth kingdom, of which we
have already spoken, that he here refers: that kingdom, than which no greater kingdom of
like nature has arisen upon the earth; from which also ten horns are to spring, and to be
apportioned among ten crowns. And amid these another little horn shall rise, which is that
of Antichrist. And it shall pluck by the roots the three others before it; that is to say, he shall
subvert the three kings of Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia, with the view of acquiring for himself
universal dominion. And after conquering the remaining seven horns, he will at last begin,
inflated by a strange and wicked spirit, to stir up war against the saints, and to persecute all
everywhere, with the aim of being glorified by all, and being worshipped as God.</p>
<p>22. “Until the Ancient of days come.” That is, when at length the Judge of judges and
the King of kings comes from heaven, who shall subvert the whole dominion and power of
the adversary, and shall consume all with the eternal fire of punishment. But to His servants,
and prophets, and martyrs, and to all who fear Him, He will give an everlasting kingdom;
that is, they shall possess the endless enjoyment of good.</p>
<p>25. “Until a time, and times, and the dividing of time.” This denotes three years and a
half.</p>
<p>Chap. ix. 21 “And, behold, the man Gabriel…flying.” You see how the prophet likens
the speed of the angels to a winged bird, on account of the light and rapid motion with
which these spirits fly so quickly in discharge of orders.</p>
<p>Chap. x. 6 “And the voice of His words.” For all we who now believe on Him declare
the words of Christ, as if we spake by His mouth the things enjoined by Him.</p>
<p>7. “And I saw,” etc. For it is to His saints that fear Him, and to them alone, that He reveals
Himself. For if any one seems to be living now in the Church, and yet has not the fear of
God, his companionship with the saints will avail him nothing.</p>
<p>12. “Thy words were heard.” Behold how much the piety of a righteous man availeth,
that to him alone, as to one worthy, things not yet to be manifested in the world should be
revealed.</p>

<pb n="475"/>
<p>13. “And lo, Michael.” Who is Michael but the angel assigned to the people? As (God)
says to Moses, “I will not go with you in the way, because the people are stiff-necked; but
my angel shall go with you.”</p>
<p>16. “My inwards are turned” (A.V., “my sorrows are turned upon me”). For it was meet
that, at the appearing of the Lord, what was above should be turned beneath, in order that
also what was beneath might come above.—I require time, he says, to recover myself, and
to be able to endure the words and to make reply to what is said.—But while I was in this
position, he continues, I was strengthened beyond my hope. For one unseen touched me,
and straightway my weakness was removed, and I was restored to my former strength. For
whenever all the strength of our life and its glory pass from us, then are we strengthened by
Christ, who stretches forth His hand and raises the living from among the dead, and as it
were from Hades itself, to the resurrection of life.</p>
<p>18. “And he strengthened me.” For whenever the Word has made us of good hope with
regard to the future, we are able also readily to hear His voice.</p>
<p>20. “To fight with the prince of Persia.” For from the day that thou didst humble thyself
before the Lord thy God thy prayer was heard, and I was sent “to fight with the prince of
Persia.” For there was a design not to let the people go. Therefore, that thy prayer might be
speedily answered, “I stood up against him.”</p>
<p>Chap. xii. 1 “There shall be a time of trouble.” For at that time there shall be great
trouble, such as has not been from the foundation of the world, when some in one way, and
others in another, shall be sent through every city and country to destroy the faithful; and
the saints shall travel from the west to the east, and shall be driven in persecution from the
east to the south, while others shall conceal themselves in the mountains and caves; and the
abomination shall war against them everywhere, and shall cut them off by sea and by land
by his decree, and shall endeavour by every means to destroy them out of the world; and
they shall not be able any longer to sell their own property, nor to buy from strangers, unless
one keeps and carries with him the name of the beast, or bears its mark upon his forehead.
For then they shall all be driven out from every place, and dragged from their own homes
and haled into prison, and punished with all manner of punishment, and cast out from the
whole world.</p>
<p>2. “These shall awake to everlasting life.” That is, those who have believed in the true
life, and who have their names written in the book of life. “And these to shame.” That is,
those who are attached to Antichrist, and who are cast with him into everlasting punishment.</p>
<p>3. “And they that be wise shall shine.” And the Lord has said the same thing in the
Gospel: “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun.”1341</p>
<note type="footnote">1341 Matt. xiii. 43.</note>

<pb n="476"/>
<p>7. “For a time, times, and an half.” By this he indicated the three and a half years of Antichrist.
For by a time he means a year; and by times, two years; and by an half time, half a
year. These are the “one thousand two hundred and ninety days” of which Daniel prophesied.</p>
<p>9. “The words are closed up and sealed.” For as a man cannot tell what God has prepared
for the saints; for neither has eye seen nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man
(to conceive) these things, into which even the saints, too, shall then eagerly desire to look;
so He said to him, “For the words are sealed until the time of the end; until many shall be
chosen and tried with fire.” And who are they who are chosen, but those who believe the
word of truth, so as to be made white thereby, and to cast off the filth of sin, and put on the
heavenly, pure, and glorious Holy Spirit, in order that, when the Bridegroom comes, they
may go in straightway with Him?</p>
<p>11. “The abomination of desolation shall be given (set up).” Daniel speaks, therefore,
of two abominations: the one of destruction, which Antiochus set up in its appointed time,
and which bears a relation to that of desolation, and the other universal, when Antichrist
shall come. For, as Daniel says, he too shall be set up for the destruction of many.1342</p>

<p>For when the iron legs that now hold the sovereignty have given place to the feet and
the toes, in accordance with the representation of the terrible beast, as has also been signified
in the former times, then from heaven will come the stone that smites the image, and breaks
it; and it will subvert all the kingdoms, and give the kingdom to the saints of the Most High.
This is the stone which becomes a great mountain, and fills the earth, and of which it is
written: “I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the
clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days. And there was given Him dominion,
and glory, and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and languages shall serve Him: His
power is an everlasting power, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be
destroyed.”1344</p>

<p>“O Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, bless ye the Lord; O ye apostles, prophets, and martyrs
of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise Him, and exalt Him above all, for ever.”</p>
<p>We may well marvel at the words of the three youths in the furnace, how they enumerated
all created things, so that not one of them might be reckoned free and independent in itself;
but, summing up and naming them all together, both things in heaven, and things in earth,
and things under the earth, they showed them to be all the servants of God, who created all
things by the Word, that no one should boast that any of the creatures was without birth
and beginning.</p>

<head>VI.</head>
<p>On Susannah.1346</p>
<p>What is narrated here, happened at a later time, although it is placed before the first
book (at the beginning of the book). For it was a custom with the writers to narrate many
things in an inverted order in their writings. For we find also in the prophets some visions
recorded among the first and fulfilled among the last; and again, on the other hand, some
recorded among the last and fulfilled first. And this was done by the disposition of the
Spirit, that the devil might not understand the things spoken in parables by the prophets,
and might not a second time lay his snares and ruin man.</p>
<p>Ver. 1. “Called Joacim.” This Joacim, being a stranger in Babylon, obtains Susannah in
marriage. And she was the daughter of Chelcias the priest,1347 who found the book of the
law in the house of the Lord, when Josiah the king commanded him to purify the holy of
holies. His brother was Jeremiah the prophet, who was carried, with the remnant that was
left after the deportation of the people to Babylon, into Egypt, and dwelt in Taphnæ;1348
and, while prophesying there, he was stoned to death by the people.</p>
<p>“A very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord,” etc. For by the fruit produced, the
tree also is easily known. For men who are pious and zealous for the law, bring into the
world children worthy of God; such as he was who became a prophet and witness of Christ,
and she who was found chaste and faithful in Babylon, whose honour and chastity were the
occasion of the manifestation of the blessed Daniel as a prophet.</p>
<p>4. “Now Joacim was a great rich man,” etc. We must therefore seek the explanation of
this. For how could those who were captives, and had been made subject to the Babylonians,
meet together in the same place, as if they were their own masters? In this matter, therefore,
we should observe that Nebuchadnezzar, after their deportation, treated them kindly, and
permitted them to meet together, and do all things according to the law.</p>
<p>7. “And at noon Susannah went into (her husband’s garden).” Susannah prefigured the
Church; and Joacim, her husband, Christ; and the garden, the calling of the saints, who are
planted like fruitful trees in the Church. And Babylon is the world; and the two elders are
set forth as a figure of the two peoples that plot against the Church—the one, namely, of
the circumcision, and the other of the Gentiles. For the words, “were appointed rulers of
<note type="footnote">1346 This apocryphal story of Susannah is found in the Greek texts of the LXX. and Theodotion, in the old
Latin and Vulgate, and in the Syriac and Arabic versions. But there is no evidence that it ever formed part of
the Hebrew, or of the original Syriac text. It is generally placed at the beginning of the book, as in the Greek
mss. and the old Latin, but is also sometimes set at the end, as in the Vulgate, ed. Compl.</note>

<pb n="480"/>
the people and judges,” (mean) that in this world they exercise authority and rule, judging
the righteous unrighteously.</p>
<p>8. “And the two elders saw her.” These things the rulers of the Jews wish now to expunge
from the book, and assert that these things did not happen in Babylon, because they are
ashamed of what was done then by the elders.</p>
<p>9. “And they perverted their own mind.” For how, indeed, can those who have been the
enemies and corruptors of the Church judge righteously, or look up to heaven with pure
heart, when they have become the slaves of the prince of this world?</p>
<p>10. “And they were both wounded with her (love).” This word is to be taken in truth;
for always the two peoples, being wounded (instigated) by Satan working in them, strive to
raise persecutions and afflictions against the Church, and seek how they may corrupt her,
though they do not agree with each other.</p>
<p>12. “And they watched diligently.” And this, too, is to be noted. For up to the present
time both the Gentiles and the Jews of the circumcision watch and busy themselves with
the dealings of the Church, desiring to suborn false witnesses against us, as the apostle says:
“And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out
our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus.”1349</p>
<p>It is a kind of sin to be anxious to give the mind to women.</p>
<p>14. “And when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other.” As to their
parting the one from the other at the hour of dinner (luncheon), this signifies that in the
matter of earthly meats the Jews and the Gentiles are not at one; but in their views, and in
all worldly matters, they are of one mind, and can meet each other.</p>
<p>14. “And asking one another, they acknowledged their lust.” Thus, in revealing themselves
to each other, they foreshadow the time when they shall be proved by their thoughts, and
shall have to give account to God for all the sin which they have done, as Solomon says:
“And scrutiny shall destroy the ungodly.”1350 For these are convicted by the scrutiny.</p>
<p>15. “As they watched a fit time.” What fit time but that of the passover, at which the
laver is prepared in the garden for those who burn, and Susannah washes herself, and is
presented as a pure bride to God?</p>
<p>“With two maids only.” For when the Church desires to take the laver according to use,
she must of necessity have two handmaids to accompany her. For it is by faith on Christ
and love to God that the Church confesses and receives the laver.</p>
<p>18. “And she said to her maids, Bring me oil.” For faith and love prepare oil and unguents
to those who are washed. But what were these unguents, but the commandments of the holy
Word? And what was the oil, but the power of the Holy Spirit, with which believers are

<note type="footnote">1350 Prov. i. 32; in our version given as, “The prosperity of fools shall destroy them.”</note>

<pb n="481"/>
anointed as with ointment after the laver of washing? All these things were figuratively
represented in the blessed Susannah, for our sakes, that we who now believe on God might
not regard the things that are done now in the Church as strange, but believe them all to
have been set forth in figure by the patriarchs of old, as the apostle also says: “Now these
things happened unto them for ensamples: and they were written for our instruction, on
whom the ends of the world are come.”1351</p>
<p>18. “And they went out at privy doors;” showing thus by anticipation, that he who desires
to partake of the water in the garden must renounce the broad gate, and enter by the strait
and narrow.1352</p>
<p>“And they saw not the elders.” For as of old the devil was concealed in the serpent in
the garden, so now too, concealed in the elders, he fired them with his own lust, that he
might again a second time corrupt Eve.</p>
<p>20. “Behold, the garden doors are shut.” O wicked rulers, and filled with the workings
of the devil, did Moses deliver these things to you? And while ye read the law yourselves,
do ye teach others thus? Thou that sayest, “Thou shalt not kill,” dost thou kill? Thou that
sayest, “Thou shalt not covet,” dost thou desire to corrupt the wife of thy neighbour?</p>
<p>“And we are in love with thee.” Why, ye lawless, do ye strive to gain over a chaste and
guileless soul by deceitful words, in order to satisfy your own lust?</p>
<p>21. “If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee.” This wicked audacity with which
you begin, comes of the deceitfulness that lurks in you from the beginning. And there was
in reality a young man with her, that one1353 of yours; one from heaven, not to have intercourse
with her, but to bear witness to her truth.</p>
<p>22. “And Susannah sighed.” The blessed Susannah, then, when she heard these words,
was troubled in her heart, and set a watch upon her mouth, not wishing to be defiled by the
wicked elders. Now it is in our power also to apprehend the real meaning of all that befell
Susannah. For you may find this also fulfilled in the present condition of the Church. For
when the two peoples conspire to destroy any of the saints, they watch for a fit time, and
enter the house of God while all there are praying and praising God, and seize some of them,
and carry them off, and keep hold of them, saying, Come, consent with us, and worship our
Gods; and if not, we will bear witness against you. And when they refuse, they drag them
before the court and accuse them of acting contrary to the decrees of Cæsar, and condemn
them to death.</p>
<p>“I am straitened on every side.” Behold the words of a chaste woman, and one dear to
God: “I am straitened on every side.” For the Church is afflicted and straitened, not only by

the Jews, but also by the Gentiles, and by those who are called Christians, but are not such
in reality. For they, observing her chaste and happy life, strive to ruin her.</p>
<p>“For if I do this thing, it is death to me.” For to be disobedient to God, and obedient to
men, works eternal death and punishment.</p>
<p>“And if I do it not, I cannot escape your hands.” And this indeed is said with truth. For
they who are brought into judgment for the sake of God’s name, if they do what is commanded
them by men, die to God, and shall live in the world. But if they refuse to do what
is commanded them by men, they escape not the hands of their judges, but are condemned
by them.</p>
<p>23. “It is better for me not to do it.” For it is better to die by the hand of wicked men
and live with God, than, by consenting to them, to be delivered from them and fall into the
hands of God.</p>
<p>24. “And Susannah cried with a loud voice.” And to whom did Susannah cry but to
God? as Isaiah says: “Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer thee; whilst thou art
yet speaking, He shall say, Lo, here I am.”1354</p>
<p>“And the two elders cried out against her.” For the wicked never cease to cry out against
us, and to say: Away with such from off the earth, for it is not fit that they should live. In an
evangelical sense, Susannah despised them who kill the body, in order that she might save
her soul from death. Now sin is the death of the soul, and especially (the sin of) adultery.
For when the soul that is united with Christ forsakes its faith, it is given over to perpetual
death, viz., eternal punishment. And in confirmation of this, in the case of the transgression
and violation of marriage unions in the flesh, the law has decreed the penalty of death.</p>
<p>25. “Then ran the one and opened the gates;” pointing to the broad and spacious way
on which they who follow such persons perish.</p>
<p>31. “Now Susannah was a very delicate woman.” Not that she had meretricious adornments
about her person, as Jezebel had, or eyes painted with divers colours; but that she
had the adornment of faith, and chastity, and sanctity.</p>
<p>34. “And laid their hands upon her head;” that at least by touching her they might satisfy
their lust.</p>
<p>35. “And she was weeping.” For by her tears she attracted the (regard of) the Word from
heaven, who was with tears to raise the dead Lazarus.</p>
<p>41. “Then the assembly believed them.” It becomes us, then, to be stedfast in every duty,
and to give no heed to lies, and to yield no obsequious obedience to the persons of rulers,
knowing that we have to give account to God; but if we follow the truth, and aim at the exact
rule of faith, we shall be well-pleasing to God.</p>
<note type="footnote">1354 Isa. lviii. 9.</note>

<pb n="483"/>
<p>44. “And the Lord heard her voice.” For those who call upon Him from a pure heart,
God heareth. But from those who (call upon Him) in deceit and hypocrisy, God turneth
away His face.</p>
<p>52. “O thou that art waxen old in wickedness.” Now, since at the outset, in the introduction,
we explained that the two elders are to be taken as a type of the two peoples, that of
the circumcision and that of the Gentiles, which are always enemies of the Church; let us
mark the words of Daniel, and learn that the Scripture deals falsely with us in nothing. For,
addressing the first elder, he censures him as one instructed in the law; while he addresses
the other as a Gentile, calling him “the seed of Chanaan,” although he was then among the
circumcision.</p>
<p>55. “For even now the angel of God.” He shows also, that when Susannah prayed to
God, and was heard, the angel was sent then to help her, just as was the case in the instance
of Tobias1355 and Sara. For when they prayed, the supplication of both of them was heard
in the same day and the same hour, and the angel Raphael was sent to heal them both.</p>
<p>61. “And they arose against the two elders;” that the saying might be fulfilled, “Whoso
diggeth a pit for his neighbour, shall fall therein.”1356</p>
<p>To all these things, therefore, we ought to give heed, beloved, fearing lest any one be
overtaken in any transgression, and risk the loss of his soul, knowing as we do that God is
the Judge of all; and the Word1357 Himself is the Eye which nothing that is done in the
world escapes. Therefore, always watchful in heart and pure in life, let us imitate Susannah.</p>

<p>For this reason we are enjoined to ask what is sufficient for the preservation of the

<p>Chap. ii. 7 And if you please, we say that the Word was the first-born of God, who came
down from heaven to the blessed Mary, and was made a first-born man in her womb, in
order that the first-born of God might be manifested in union with a first-born man.</p>
<p>22. When they brought Him to the temple to present Him to the Lord, they offered the
oblations of purification. For if the gifts of purification according to the law were offered
for Him, in this indeed He was made under the law. But the Word was not subject to the
law in such wise as the sycophants1361 fancy, since He is the law Himself; neither did God
need sacrifices of purification, for He purifieth and sanctifieth all things at once in a moment.
But though He took to Himself the frame of man as He received it from the Virgin, and was
made under the law, and was thus purified after the manner of the first-born, it was not
because He needed this ceremonial that He underwent its services, but only for the purpose
of redeeming from the bondage of the law those who were sold under the judgment of the
curse.</p>
<p>Chap. xxiii For this reason the warders of Hades trembled when they saw Him; and the
gates of brass and the bolts of iron were broken. For, lo, the Only-begotten entered, a soul
among souls, God the Word with a (human) soul. For His body lay in the tomb, not emptied
of divinity; but as, while in Hades, He was in essential being with His Father, so was He also
in the body and in Hades.1362 For the Son is not contained in space, just as the Father; and
He comprehends all things in Himself. But of His own will he dwelt in a body animated by
a soul, in order that with His soul He might enter Hades, and not with His pure divinity.</p>

<p>Doubtful Fragments on the Pentateuch.1363</p>
<p>Preface.</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, one God. This is a transcript
of the excellent law. But before beginning to give the transcript of the book of the law, it
will be worth while to instruct you, O brother, as to its excellence, and the dignity of its
disposition. Its first excellence is, that God delivered it by the hand of our most blessed ruler,
the chief of the prophets, and first of the apostles, or those who were sent to the children of
Israel, viz., Moses the son of Amram, the son of Kohath, of the sons of Levi. Now he was
adorned with all manner of wisdom, and endowed with the best genius. Illustrious in dignity,
remarkable for the integrity of his disposition, distinguished for power of reason, he talked
with God. And He chose him as an instrument of value. By His leader and prophet, God
Most High sent it down to us, and committed it to us (blessed be His name) in the Syriac
tongue of the Targum, which the Seventy translated into the Hebrew tongue, to wit, into
the tongue of the nation, and the idiom of the common people. Moses. therefore, received
it from the eternal Lord, and was the first to whom it was entrusted, and who obeyed its
rules and ordinances. Then he taught it to the children of Israel, who also embraced it. And
he explained to them its profound mysteries and dark places. And he expounded to them
those things which were less easy, as God permitted him, and concealed from them those
secrets of the law, as God forbade him (to reveal them). Nor did there rise among them one
who was better practised in His judgments and decrees, and who communicated more
clearly the mysteries of His doctrine, until God translated him to Himself, after He had
made him perfect by forty whole years in the wilderness.</p>
<p>And these following are the names of the teachers who handed down the law in continuous
succession after Moses the prophet, until the advent of Messiah:—</p>
<p>Know, then, my brother, whom may God bless, that God delivered the most excellent
law into the hands of Moses the prophet, the son of Amram.</p>
<p>And Moses delivered it to Joshua the son of Nun.</p>

the priestly, and kingly, and prophetic offices.</p>
<p>These were teachers at the advent of Messias; and they were both priests of the children
of Israel. Therefore the whole number of venerable and honourable priests put in trust of
this most excellent law was fifty-six, Hanan (i.e., Annas) and Caiaphas being excepted.</p>

nor did there arise any priests after them.</p>
<p>This is the account of what took place with regard to the most excellent law.</p>
<p>Armius, author of the book of Times, has said: In the nineteenth year of the reign of
King Ptolemy, He ordered the elders of the children of Israel to be assembled, in order that
they might put into his hands a copy of the law, and that they might each be at hand to explain
its meaning.</p>
<p>The elders accordingly came, bringing with them the most excellent law. Then he
commanded that every one of them should interpret the book of the law to him.</p>
<p>But he dissented from the interpretation which the elders had given. And he ordered
the elders to be thrust into prison and chains. And seizing the book of the law, he threw it
into a deep ditch, and cast fire and hot ashes upon it for seven days. Then afterwards he
ordered them to throw the filth of the city into that ditch in which was the book of the law.
And the ditch was filled to the very top.</p>
<p>The law remained seventy years under the filth in that ditch, yet did not perish, nor was
there even a single leaf of it spoilt.</p>
<note type="footnote">1364 See Tsemach David, and Maimon. Præfat. ad Seder Zeraim, in Pocockii Porta Moses, p. 36.</note>

<pb n="489"/>
<p>In the twenty-first year of the reign of King Apianutus they took the book of the law
out of the ditch, and not one leaf thereof was spoilt.</p>
<p>And after the ascension of Christ into heaven, came King Titus, son of Aspasianus king
of Rome, to Jerusalem, and besieged and took it. And he destroyed the edifice of the second
house, which the children of Israel had built. Titus the king destroyed the house of the
sanctuary, and slew all the Jews who were in it, and built Tsion (sic) in their blood. And
after that deportation the Jews were scattered abroad in slavery. Nor did they assemble any
more in the city of Jerusalem, nor is there hope anywhere of their returning.</p>
<p>After Jerusalem was laid waste, therefore, Shemaia and Antalia (Abtalion) delivered the
law,—kings of Baalbach,1365 a city which Soliman, son of King David, had built of old, and
which was restored anew in the days of King Menasse, who sawed Esaia the prophet asunder.</p>
<p>King Adrian, of the children of Edom, besieged Baalbach, and took it, and slew all the
Jews who were in it, (and) as many as were of the family of David he reduced to slavery.
And the Jews were dispersed over the whole earth, as God Most High had foretold: “And I
will scatter you among the Gentiles, and disperse you among the nations.”</p>

<p>And the Lord Said: “And I Will Bring the Waters of the Flood Upon the Earth to
Destroy All Flesh,” Etc.</p>
<p>Hippolytus, the Targumist expositor, said: The names of the wives of the sons of Noah
are these: the name of the wife of Sem, Nahalath Mahnuk; and the name of the wife of Cham,
Zedkat Nabu; and the name of the wife of Japheth, Arathka. These, moreover, are their
names in the Syriac Targum.1366 The name of the wife of Sem was Nahalath Mahnuk; the
name of the wife of Cham, Zedkat Nabu; the name of the wife of Japheth, Arathka.</p>
<p>Therefore God gave intimation to Noah, and informed him of the coming of the flood,
and of the destruction of the ruined (wicked).</p>
<p>And God Most High ordered him to descend from the holy mount, him and his sons,
and the wives of his sons, and to build a ship of three storeys. The lower storey was for fierce,
wild, and dangerous beasts. Between them there were stakes or wooden beams, to separate
them from each other, and prevent them from having intercourse with each other. The
middle storey was for birds, and their different genera. Then the upper storey was for Noah
himself and his sons—for his own wife and his sons’ wives.</p>
<p>Noah also made a door in the ship, on the east side. He also constructed tanks of water,
and store-rooms of provisions.</p>
<p>When he had made an end, accordingly, of building the ship, Noah, with his sons, Sem,
Cham, and Japheth, entered the cave of deposits.1367</p>
<p>And on their first approach, indeed, they happily found the bodies of the fathers, Adam,
Seth, Enosh, Kainan, Mahaliel, Jared, Mathusalach, and Lamech. Those eight bodies were
in the place of deposits, viz., those of Adam, Seth, Enosh, Kainan, Mahaliel, Jared, Mathusalach,
and Lamech.</p>
<p>Noah, moreover, took the body of Adam. And his sons took with them offerings. Sem
carried gold, Cham myrrh, and Japheth frankincense. Then, leaving the cave of deposits,
they transferred the offerings and the body of Adam to the holy mount.1368</p>
<p>And when they sat down by the body of Adam, over against paradise, they began to
lament and weep for the loss of paradise.</p>
<p>Then, descending from the holy mount, and lifting up their eyes towards paradise, they
renewed their weeping and wailing, (and) uttered an eternal farewell in these terms: Farewell!
peace to thee, O paradise of God! Farewell, O habitation of religion and purity! Farewell, O
seat of pleasure and delight!</p>
<note type="footnote">1366 What follows was thus expressed probably in Syriac in some Syriac version.</note>
<note type="footnote">1367 Cavernam thesaurorum. [Cant. iv. 6, i.e., Paradise.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1368 Cavernam thesaurorum. [Cant. iv. 6, i.e., Paradise.]</note>

<pb n="493"/>
<p>Then they embraced the stones and trees of the holy mount, and wept, and said: Farewell,
O habitation of the good! Farewell, O abode of holy bodies!</p>
<p>Then, after three days, Noah, with his sons and his sons’ wives, came down from the
holy mount to the base of the holy mount, to the ship’s place. For the (ark) was under the
projecting edge of the holy mount.</p>
<p>And Noah entered the ship, and deposited the body of Adam, and the offerings, in the
middle of the ship, upon a bier of wood, which he had prepared for the reception of the
body.</p>
<p>And God charged Noah, saying: Make for thyself rattles1369 of boxwood (or cypress).
Now שמשאר is the wood called Sagh, i.e., Indian plane.</p>
<p>Make also the hammer (bell) thereof of the same wood. And the length of the rattle shall
be three whole cubits, and its breadth one and a half cubit.</p>
<p>And God enjoined him to strike the rattles three times every day, to wit, for the first
time at early dawn, for the second time at mid-day, and for the third time at sunset.
And it happened that, as soon as Noah had struck the rattles, the sons of Cain and the
sons of Vahim ran up straightway to him, and he warned and alarmed them by telling of
the immediate approach of the flood, and of the destruction already hasting on and impending.</p>
<p>Thus, moreover, was the pity of God toward them displayed, that they might be converted
and come to themselves again. But the sons of Cain did not comply with what Noah proclaimed
to them. And Noah brought together pairs, male and female, of all birds of every
kind; and thus also of all beasts, tame and wild alike, pair and pair.</p>

<head>Section IV.
On Gen. vii. 6</head>
<p>Hippolytus, the Syrian expositor of the Targum, has said: We find in an ancient Hebrew
copy that God commanded Noah to range the wild beasts in order in the lower floor or
storey, and to separate the males from the females by putting wooden stakes between them.</p>
<p>And thus, too, he did with all the cattle, and also with the birds in the middle storey.
And God ordered the males thus to be separated from the females for the sake of decency
and purity, lest they should perchance get intermingled with each other.</p>
<p>Moreover, God said to Moses: Provide victuals for yourself and your children. And let
them be of wheat, ground, pounded, kneaded with water, and dried. And Noah there and
then bade his wife, and his sons’ wives, diligently attend to kneading dough and laying it in
the oven. They kneaded dough accordingly, and prepared just about as much as might be
sufficient for them, so that nothing should remain over but the very least.</p>
<p>And God charged Noah, saying to him: Whosoever shall first announce to you the approach
of the deluge, him you shall destroy that very moment. In the meantime, moreover,
the wife of Cham was standing by, about to put a large piece of bread into the oven. And
suddenly, according to the word of the Lord, water rushed forth from the oven, and the flow
of water penetrated and destroyed the bread. Therefore the wife of Cham exclaimed, addressing
herself to Noah: Oh, sir, the word of God is come good: “that which God foretold is
come to pass;” execute, therefore, that which the Lord commanded. And when Noah heard
the words of the wife of Chain, he said to her: Is then the flood already come? The wife of
Cham said to him: Thou hast said it. God, however, suddenly charged Noah, saying: Destroy
not the wife of Cham; for from thy mouth is the beginning of destruction—“thou didst first
say, The flood is come.” At the voice of Noah the flood came, and suddenly the water destroyed
that bread. And the floodgates of heaven were opened, and the rains broke upon the
earth. And that same voice, in sooth, which had said of old, “Let the waters be gathered together
into one place, and let the dry land appear,”1370 gave permission to the fountain of
waters and the floods of the seas to break forth of their own accord, and brought out the
waters.</p>
<p>Consider what God said about the world: Let all its high places be brought low, and they
were brought low; and let its low places be raised from its depths.</p>
<p>And the earth was made bare and empty of all existence, as it was at the beginning.</p>
<p>And the rain descended from above, and the earth burst open beneath. And the frame
of the earth was destroyed, and its primitive order was broken. And the world became such
<note type="footnote">1370 Gen. i. 9.</note>

<pb n="495"/>
as it was when desolated at the beginning by the waters which flowed over it. Nor was any
one of the existences upon it left in its integrity.</p>
<p>Its former structure went to wreck, and the earth was disfigured by the flood of waters
that burst upon it, and by the magnitude of its inundations, and the multitude of showers,
and the eruption from its depths, as the waters continually broke forth. In fine, it was left
such as it was formerly1371.</p>

<p>On Gen. viii. I</p>
<p>Hippolytus, the expositor of the Targum, and my master, Jacobus Rohaviensis, have
said: On the twenty-seventh day of the month Jiar, which is the second Hebrew month, the
ark rose from the base of the holy mount; and already the waters bore it, and it was carried
upon them round about towards the four cardinal points of the world. The ark accordingly
held off from the holy mount towards the east, then returned towards the west, then turned
to the south, and finally, bearing off eastwards, neared Mount Kardu on the first day of the
tenth month. And that is the second month Kanun.</p>
<p>And Noah came out of the ark on the twenty-seventh day of the month Jiar, in the
second year: for the ark continued sailing five whole months, and moved to and fro upon
the waters, and in a period of fifty-one days neared the land. Nor thereafter did it float about
any longer. But it only moved successively toward the four cardinal points of the earth, and
again finally stood toward the east. We say, moreover, that that was a sign of the cross. And
the ark was a symbol of the Christ who was expected. For that ark was the means of the
salvation of Noah and his sons, and also of the cattle, the wild beasts, and the birds. And
Christ, too, when He suffered on the cross, delivered us from accusations and sins, and
washed us in His own blood most pure.</p>
<p>And just as the ark returned to the east, and neared Mount Kardu, so also Christ, when
the work was accomplished and finished which He had proposed to Himself, returned to
heaven to the bosom of His Father, and sat down upon the throne of His glory at the Father’s
right hand.</p>
<p>As to Mount Kardu, it is in the east, in the land of the sons of Raban, and the Orientals
call it Mount Godash;1372 the Arabians and Persians call it Ararat.1373</p>
<p>And there is a town of the name Kardu, and that hill is called after it, which is indeed
very lofty and inaccessible, whose summit no one has ever been able to reach, on account
of the violence of the winds and the storms which always prevail there. And if any one attempts
to ascend it, there are demons that rush upon him, and cast him down headlong
from the ridge of the mountain into the plain, so that he dies. No one, moreover, knows
what there is on the top of the mountain, except that certain relics of the wood of the ark
still lie there on the surface of the top of the mountain.1374</p>

On Deut. xxxiii. II</head>
<p>Hippolytus, the expositor of the Targum, has said that Moses, when he had finished
this prophecy, also pronounced a blessing upon all the children of Israel, by their several
tribes, and prayed for them. Then God charged Moses, saying to him, Go up to Mount
Nebo, which indeed is known by the name of the mount of the Hebrews, which is in the
land of Moab over against Jericho.</p>
<p>And He said to him: View the land of Chanaan, which I am to give to the children of
Israel for an inheritance. Thou, however, shalt never enter it; wherefore view it well from
afar off. When Moses therefore viewed it, he saw that land,—a land green, and abounding
with all plenty and fertility, planted thickly with trees; and Moses was greatly moved, and
wept.</p>
<p>And when Moses descended from Mount Nebo, he called for Joshua the son of Nun,
and said to him before the children of Israel: Prevail, and be strong; for thou art to bring
the children of Israel into the land which God promised to fathers that He would give their
them for an inheritance. Fear not, therefore, the people, neither be afraid of the nations: for
God will be with thee.</p>
<p>And Moses wrote that Senna1375 (Hebr. מנשה ="secondary law,” or “Deuteronomy”),
and gave it to the priests the sons of Levi, and commanded them, saying: For seven years
keep this Senna hid, and show it not within the entire course of seven years. (“And then”)
in the feast of tabernacles, the priests the sons of Levi will read this law before the children
of Israel, that the whole people, men and women alike, may observe the words of God:
Command them to keep the word of God, which is in that law. And whosoever shall violate
one of its precepts, let him be accursed.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when Moses had finished the writing of the law, he gave it to Joshua the
son of Nun, and enjoined him to give it to the sons of Levi, the priests. Moses also enjoined
and charged them to place the book of the law again within the ark of the covenant of the
Lord, that it might remain there for a testimony for ever.</p>
<p>And when Moses had made an end of his injunctions, God bade him go up Mount
Nebo, which is over against Jericho. The Lord showed him the whole land of promise in its
four quarters, from the wilderness to the sea, and from sea to sea. And the Lord said to him,
Thou hast seen it indeed with thine eyes, but thou shalt never enter it. There accordingly
<note type="footnote">1375 That is the name the Mohammedans give to their Traditions.</note>

<pb n="498"/>
Moses died, the servant of God, by the command of God. And the angels buried him on
Mount Nebo, which is over against Beth-Phegor. And no one knows of his sepulchre, even
to this day. For God concealed his grave.</p>
<p>And Moses lived 120 years; nor was his eye dim, nor was the skin of his face wrinkled.</p>
<p>Moses died on a certain day, at the third hour of the day, on the seventh day of the
second month, which is the month Jiar.</p>
<p>And the children of Israel wept for him in the plains of Moab three days.</p>
<p>And Joshua the sun of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his
hand upon him. And all the children of Israel obeyed him. And God charged Joshua the
son of Nun on a certain day,—namely, the seventh day of the month Nisan.</p>
<p>And Joshua the son of Nun lived 110 years, and died on the fourth day, which was the
first day of the month Elul. And they buried him in the city Thamnatserach, on Mount
Ephraim.</p>

<head>On the Psalms.1376</head>
<head>I.</head>
<p>The Argument of the Exposition of the Psalms by Hippolytus, (Bishop) of Rome.</p>
<p>1. The book of Psalms contains new doctrine after the law which was given by Moses;
and thus it is the second book of doctrine after the Scripture of Moses. After the death, then
of Moses and Joshua, and after the judges, David arose, one deemed worthy to be called the
father of the Saviour, and he was the first to give the Hebrews a new style of psalmody, by
which he did away with the ordinances established by Moses with respect to sacrifice, and
introduced a new mode of the worship of God by hymns and acclamations; and many other
things also beyond the law of Moses he taught through his whole ministry. And this is the
sacredness of the book, and its utility. And the account to be given of its inscription is this:
(for) as most of the brethren who believe in Christ think that this book is David’s, and inscribe
it “Psalms of David,” we must state what has reached us with respect to it. The Hebrews
give the book the title “Sephra Thelim,”1377 and in the “Acts of the Apostles” it is called the
“Book of Psalms” (the words are these, “as it is written in the Book of Psalms”), but the
name (of the author) in the inscription of the book is not found there. And the reason of
that is, that the words written there are not the words of one man, but those of several together;
Esdra, as tradition says, having collected in one volume, after the captivity, the psalms
of several, or rather their words, as they are not all psalms. Thus the name of David is prefixed
in the case of some, and that of Solomon in others, and that of Asaph in others. There are
some also that belong to Idithum (Jeduthun); and besides these there are others that belong
to the sons of Core (Korah), and even to Moses. As they are therefore the words of so many
thus collected together, they could not be said by any one who understands the matter to
be by David alone.</p>
<p>2. As regards those which have no inscription, we must also inquire to whom we ought
to ascribe them. For why is it that even the simplest inscription is wanting in them—such
as the one which runs thus, “A psalm of David,” or “Of David,” without any addition? Now,
my idea is, that wherever this inscription occurs alone, what is written is neither a psalm
nor a song, but some sort of utterance under guidance of the Holy Spirit, recorded for the
behoof of him who is able to understand it. But the opinion of a certain Hebrew on these
last matters has reached me, who held that, when there were many without any inscription,
but preceded by one with the inscription “Of David,” all these should be reckoned also to
be by David. And if this be the case, it follows that those without any inscription are by
<note type="footnote">1376 Simon de Magistris, Acta Martyrum Ostiensium, Append., p. 439.</note>
<note type="footnote">1377 That is an attempt to express in Greek letters the Hebrew title, viz., סֵפֶר תְּהִלָּס = Book of Praises</note>

<pb n="500"/>
those (writers) who are rightly reckoned, according to the titles, to be the authors of the
psalms preceding these. This book of Psalms before us has also been called by the prophet
the “Psalter,” because, as they say, the psaltery alone among musical instruments gives back
the sound from above when the brass is struck, and not from beneath, after the manner of
others. In order, therefore, that those who understand it may be zealous to carry out the
analogy of such an appellation, and may also look above, from which direction its melody
comes—for this reason he has styled it the Psalter. For it is entirely the voice and utterance
of the most Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>3. Let us inquire, further, why there are one hundred and fifty psalms. That the number
fifty is sacred, is manifest from the days of the celebrated festival of Pentecost, which indicates
release from labours, and (the possession of) joy. For which reason neither fasting nor
bending the knee is decreed for those days.1378 For this is a symbol of the great assembly
that is reserved for future times. Of which times there was a shadow in the land of Israel in
the year called among the Hebrews “Jobel” (Jubilee), which is the fiftieth year in number,
and brings with it liberty for the slave, and release from debt, and the like. And the holy
Gospel knows also the remission of the number fifty, and of that number which is cognate
with it, and stands by it, viz., five hundred;1379 for it is not without a purpose that we have
given us there the remission of fifty pence and of five hundred. Thus, then, it was also meet
that the hymns to God on account of the destruction of enemies, and in thanksgiving for
the goodness of God, should contain not simply one set of fifty, but three such, for the name
of Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>4. The number fifty, moreover, contains seven sevens, or a Sabbath of Sabbaths; and
also over and above these full Sabbaths, a new beginning, in the eight, of a really new rest
that remains above the Sabbaths. And let any one who is able, observe this (as it is carried
out) in the Psalms with more, indeed, than human accuracy, so as to find out the reasons
in each case, as we shall set them forth. Thus, for instance, it is not without a purpose that
the eighth psalm has the inscription, “On the wine-presses,” as it comprehends the perfection
of fruits in the eight; for the time for the enjoyment of the fruits of the true vine could not
be before the eight. And again, the second psalm inscribed “On the wine-presses,” is the
eightieth, containing another eighth number, viz., in the tenth multiple. The eighty-third,
again, is made up by the union of two holy numbers, viz., the eight in the tenth multiple,
and the three in the first multiple. And the fiftieth psalm is a prayer for the remission of
sins, and a confession. For as, according to the Gospel, the fiftieth obtained remission,
confirming thereby that understanding of the jubilee, so he who offers up such petitions in
full confession hopes to gain remission in no other number than the fiftieth. And again,
<note type="footnote">1378 [See vol. iii. pp. 94, 103.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1379 Luke vii. 41. [Dan. viii. 13, (Margin.) “Palmoni,” etc.]</note>

<pb n="501"/>
there are also certain others which are called “Songs of degrees,” in number fifteen, as was
also the number of the steps of the temple, and which show thereby, perhaps, that the “steps”
(or “degrees”) are comprehended within the number seven and the number eight. And these
songs of degrees begin after the one hundred and twentieth psalm, which is called simply
“a psalm,” as the more accurate copies give it. And this is the number1380 of the perfection
of the life of man. And the hundredth1381 psalm, which begins thus, “I will sing of mercy
and judgment, O Lord,” embraces the life of the saint in fellowship with God. And the one
hundred and fiftieth ends with these words, “Let every thing that hath breath praise the
Lord.”</p>
<p>5. But since, as we have already said, to do this in the case of each, and to find out the
reasons, is very difficult, and too much for human nature to accomplish, we shall content
ourselves with these things by way of an outline. Only let us add this, that the psalms which
deal with historical matter are not found in regular historical order. And the only reason
for this is to be found in the numbers according to which the psalms are arranged. For instance,
the history in the fifty-first is antecedent to the history in the fiftieth. For everybody
acknowledges that the matter of Doeg the Idumean calumniating David to Saul is antecedent
to the sin with the wife of Urias; yet it is not without good reason that the history which
should be second is placed first, since, as we have before said, the place regarding remission
has an affinity with the number fifty. He, therefore, who is not worthy of remission, passes
the number fifty, as Doeg the Idumean. For the fifty-first is the psalm that treats of him.
And, moreover, the third is in the same position, since it was written when David fled from
the face of Absalom his son; and thus, as all know who read the books of Kings, it should
come properly after the fifty-first and the fiftieth.</p>
<p>And if any one desires to give further attention to these and such like matters, he will
find more exact explanations of the history for himself, as well as of the inscriptions and
the order of the psalms.</p>
<p>6. It is likely, also, that a similar account is to be given of the fact, that David alone of
the prophets prophesied with an instrument, called by the Greeks the “psaltery,”1382 and
by the Hebrews the “nabla,” which is the only musical instrument that is quite straight, and
has no curve. And the sound does not come from the lower parts, as is the case with the lute
and certain other instruments, but from the upper. For in the lute and the lyre the brass
when struck gives back the sound from beneath. But this psaltery has the source of its musical
numbers above, in order that we, too, may practise seeking things above, and not suffer
ourselves to be borne down by the pleasure of melody to the passions of the flesh. And I
<note type="footnote">1380 Gen. vi. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">1381 i.e., in our version the 101st.</note>
<note type="footnote">1382 [See learned remarks of Pusey, p. 27 of his Lectures on Daniel.]</note>

<pb n="502"/>
think that this truth, too, was signified deeply and clearly to us in a prophetic way in the
construction of the instrument, viz., that those who have souls well ordered and trained,
have the way ready to things above. And again, an instrument having the source of its melodious
sound in its upper parts, may be taken as like the body of Christ and His saints—the
only instrument that maintains rectitude; “for He did no sin, neither was guile found in his
mouth.”1383 This is indeed an instrument, harmonious, melodious, well-ordered, that took
in no human discord, and did nothing out of measure, but maintained in all things, as it
were, harmony towards the Father; for, as He says: “He that is of the earth is earthly, and
speaketh of the earth: He that cometh from heaven, testifies of what He has seen and
heard.”1384</p>
<p>7. As there are “psalms,” and “songs,” and “psalms of song,” and “songs of psalmody,”1385
it remains that we discuss the difference between these. We think, then, that the “psalms”
are those which are simply played to an instrument, without the accompaniment of the
voice, and (which are composed) for the musical melody of the instrument; and that those
are called “songs” which are rendered by the voice in concert with the music; and that they
are called “psalms of song” when the voice takes the lead, while the appropriate sound is
also made to accompany it, rendered harmoniously by the instruments; and “songs of
psalmody,” when the instrument takes the lead, while the voice has the second place, and
accompanies the music of the strings. And thus much as to the letter of what is signified by
these terms. But as to the mystical interpretation, it would be a “psalm” when, by smiting
the instrument, viz., the body, with good deeds we succeed in good action though not wholly
proficient in speculation; and a “song,” when, by revolving the mysteries of the truth, apart
from the practical, and assenting fully to them, we have the noblest thoughts of God and
His oracles, while knowledge enlightens us, and wisdom shines brightly in our souls; and a
“song of psalmody,” when, while good action takes the lead, according to the word, “If thou
desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee,”1386 we
understand wisdom at the same time, and are deemed worthy by God to know the truth of
things, till now kept hid from us; and a “psalm of song,” when, by revolving with the light
of wisdom some of the more abstruse questions pertaining to morals, we first become
prudent in action, and then also able to tell what, and when, and how action is to be taken.
And perhaps this is the reason why the first inscriptions nowhere contain the word “songs,”
but only “psalm” or “psalms;” for the saint does not begin with speculation; but when he
has become in a simple way a believer, according to orthodoxy, he devotes himself to the
<note type="footnote">1383 Isa. liii. 9. [Vol. i. cap. iv. p. 50.]</note>
<note type="footnote">1384 John iii. 31.</note>
<note type="footnote">1385 The Greek is: ὄντων ψαλμῶν, καὶ οὐσῶν ᾠδῶν, καὶ ψαλμῶν ᾠδῆς, καὶ ᾠδῶν ψαλμοῦ.</note>
<note type="footnote">1386 Ecclus. i. 26.</note>

<pb n="503"/>
actions that are to be done. For this reason, also, are there many “songs” at the end; and
wherever there is the word “degrees,” there we do not find the word “psalm,” whether by
itself alone or with any addition, but only “songs.” For in the “degrees” (or “ascents”), the
saints will be engaged in nothing but in speculation alone. And let the account which we
have offered, following the indications given in the interpretation of the Seventy, suffice for
this subject in general.</p>
<p>8. But again, as we found in the Seventy, and in Theodotion, and in Symmachus, in
some psalms, and these not a few, the word διάψαλμα inserted,1387 we endeavoured to make
out whether those who placed it there meant to mark a change at those places in rhythm or
melody, or any alteration in the mode of instruction, or in thought, or in force of language.
It is found, however, neither in Aquila nor in the Hebrew; but there, instead of διάψαλμα
(= an intervening musical symphony), we find the word ἀεί (= ever). And further, let not
this fact escape thee, O man of learning, that the Hebrews also divided the Psalter into five
books, so that it might be another Pentateuch. For from Ps. i. to xl. they reckoned one book;
and from xli. to lxxi. they reckoned a second; and from lxxii. to lxxxviii. they counted a third
book; and from lxxxix. to cv. a fourth; and from cvi. to cl. they made up the fifth. For they
judged that each psalm closing with the words, “Blessed be the Lord, Amen, amen,” formed
the conclusion of a book. And in them we have “prayer,” viz., supplication offered to God
for anything requisite; and the “vow,” i.e., engagement; and the “hymn,” which is the song
of blessing to God for benefits enjoyed; and “praise” or “extolling,” which is the laudation
of the wonders of God. For laudation is nothing else but just the superlative of praise.</p>
<p>9. However it may be with the “time when and the manner” in which this idea of the
Psalms has hit upon by the inspired David, he at least seems to have been the first, and indeed
the only one, concerned in it, and that, too, at the earliest period, when he taught his fingers
to tune the psaltery. For if any other before him showed the use of the psaltery and lute, it
was at any rate in a very different way that such an one did it, only putting together some
rude and clumsy contrivance, or simply employing the instrument, without singing either
to melody or to words, but only amusing himself with a rude sort of pleasure. But after such
he was the first to reduce the affair to rhythm, and order, and art, and also to wed the singing
of the song with the melody. And, what is of greater importance, this most inspired of men
sang to God, or of God, beginning in this wise even at the period when he was among the
shepherds and youths in a simpler and humbler style, and afterwards when he became a
man and a king, attempting something loftier and of more public interest. And he is said

<pb n="504"/>
to have made this advance, especially after he had brought back the ark into the city. At that
time he often danced before the ark, and often sang songs of thanksgiving and songs to
celebrate its recovery. And then by and by, allocating the whole tribe of the Levites to the
duty, he appointed four leaders of the choirs, viz., Asaph, Aman (Heman), Ethan, and
Idithum (Jeduthun), inasmuch as there are also in all things visible four primal principles.
And he then formed choirs of men, selected from the rest. And he fixed their number at
seventy-two, having respect, I think, to the number of the tongues that were confused, or
rather divided, at the time of the building of the tower. And what was typified by this, but
that hereafter all tongues shall again unite in one common confession, when the Word takes
possession of the whole world?</p>

<p>On Psalm lviii. 11</p>
<p>But since there is a time when the righteous shall rejoice, and sinners shall meet the end
foretold for them, we must with all reason fully acknowledge and declare that God is inspector
and overseer of all that is done among men, and judges all who dwell upon earth. It is
proper further to inquire whether the prophecy in hand, which quite corresponds and fits
in with those preceding it, may describe the end.</p>
<p>When Hippolytus dictated these words,1390 the grammarian asked him why he hesitated
about that prophecy, as if he mistrusted the divine power in that calamity of exile.</p>
<p>The learned man calls attention to the question why the word διαγράφῃ (= may describe)
was used by me in the subjunctive mood, as if silently indicating doubt.</p>
<p>Hippolytus accordingly replied:—</p>
<p>You know indeed quite well, that words of that form are used as conveying by implication
a rebuke to those who study the prophecies about Christ, and talk righteousness with the
mouth, while they do not admit His coming, nor listen to His voice when He calls to them,
and says, “He that hath ears to hear let him hear;” who have made themselves like the serpent
and have made their ears like those of a deaf viper, and so forth. God then does, in truth,
take care of the righteous, and judges their cause when injured on the earth; and He punishes
those who dare to injure them.</p>

<p>For this reason, even up to our day, though they see the boundaries (of their country),
and go round about them, they stand afar off. And therefore have they no longer king or
high priest or prophet, nor even scribes and Pharisees and Sadducees among them. He does
not, however, say that they are to be cut off; wherefore their race still subsists, and the succession
of their children is continued. For they have not been cut off nor consumed from
among men—but they are and exist still—yet only as those who have been rejected and cast
down from the honour of which of old they were deemed worthy by God. But again, “Scatter
them,” he says, “by Thy power;” which word has also come to pass. For they are scattered
throughout the whole earth, in servitude everywhere, and engaging in the lowest and most
servile occupations, and doing any unseemly work for hunger’s sake.</p>
<p>For if they were destroyed from among men, and remained nowhere among the living,
they could not see my people, he means, nor know my Church in its prosperity. Therefore
“scatter” them everywhere on earth, where my Church is to be established, in order that
when they see the Church founded by me, they may be roused to emulate it in piety. And

<p>Treatise on Christ and Antichrist.1393</p>
<p>1. As it was your desire, my beloved brother Theophilus,1394 to be thoroughly informed
on those topics which I put summarily before you, I have thought it right to set these matters
of inquiry clearly forth to your view, drawing largely from the Holy Scriptures themselves
as from a holy fountain, in order that you may not only have the pleasure of hearing them
on the testimony of men,1395 but may also be able, by surveying them in the light of (divine)
authority, to glorify God in all. For this will be as a sure supply furnished you by us for your
journey in this present life, so that by ready argument applying things ill understood and
apprehended by most, you may sow them in the ground of your heart, as in a rich and clean
soil.1396 By these, too, you will be able to silence those who oppose and gainsay the word of
salvation. Only see that you do not give these things over to unbelieving and blasphemous
tongues, for that is no common danger. But impart them to pious and faithful men, who
desire to live holily and righteously with fear. For it is not to no purpose that the blessed
apostle exhorts Timothy, and says, “O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust,
avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called; which
some professing have erred concerning the faith.”1397 And again, “Thou therefore, my son,
be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard of me in
many exhortations, the same commit thou to faithful men,1398 who shall be able to teach
others also.”1399 If, then, the blessed (apostle) delivered these things with a pious caution,
which could be easily known by all, as he perceived in the spirit that “all men have not

faith,”1400 how much greater will be our danger, if, rashly and without thought, we commit
the revelations of God to profane and unworthy men?</p>
<p>2. For as the blessed prophets were made, so to speak, eyes for us, they foresaw through
faith the mysteries of the word, and became ministers of these1401 things also to succeeding
generations, not only reporting the past, but also announcing the present and the future, so
that the prophet might not appear to be one only for the time being, but might also predict
the future for all generations, and so be reckoned a (true) prophet. For these fathers were
furnished with the Spirit, and largely honoured by the Word Himself; and just as it is with
instruments of music, so had they the Word always, like the plectrum,1402 in union with
them, and when moved by Him the prophets announced what God willed. For they spake
not of their own power1403 (let there be no mistake as to that1404), neither did they declare
what pleased themselves. But first of all they were endowed with wisdom by the Word, and
then again were rightly instructed in the future by means of visions. And then, when thus
themselves fully convinced, they spake those things which1405 were revealed by God to them
alone, and concealed from all others. For with what reason should the prophet be called a
prophet, unless he in spirit foresaw the future? For if the prophet spake of any chance event,
he would not be a prophet then in speaking of things which were under the eye of all. But
one who sets forth in detail things yet to be, was rightly judged a prophet. Wherefore
prophets were with good reason called from the very first “seers.”1406 And hence we, too,
who are rightly instructed in what was declared aforetime by them, speak not of our own
capacity. For we do not attempt to make any change one way or another among ourselves
in the words that were spoken of old by them, but we make the Scriptures in which these
are written public, and read them to those who can believe rightly; for that is a common
benefit for both parties: for him who speaks, in holding in memory and setting forth correctly
things uttered of old;1407 and for him who hears, in giving attention to the things spoken.
Since, then, in this there is a work assigned to both parties together, viz., to him who speaks,

that he speak forth faithfully without regard to risk,1408 and to him who hears, that he hear
and receive in faith that which is spoken, I beseech you to strive together with me in prayer
to God.</p>
<p>3. Do you wish then to know in what manner the Word of God, who was again the Son
of God,1409 as He was of old the Word, communicated His revelations to the blessed
prophets in former times? Well, as the Word shows His compassion and His denial of all
respect of persons by all the saints, He enlightens them1410 and adapts them to that which
is advantageous for us, like a skilful physician, understanding the weakness of men. And
the ignorant He loves to teach, and the erring He turns again to His own true way. And by
those who live by faith He is easily found; and to those of pure eye and holy heart, who desire
to knock at the door, He opens immediately. For He casts away none of His servants as
unworthy of the divine mysteries. He does not esteem the rich man more highly than the
poor, nor does He despise the poor man for his poverty. He does not disdain the barbarian,
nor does He set the eunuch aside as no man.1411 He does not hate the female on account
of the woman’s act of disobedience in the beginning, nor does He reject the male on account
of the man’s transgression. But He seeks all, and desires to save all, wishing to make all the
children of God, and calling all the saints unto one perfect man. For there is also one Son
(or Servant) of God, by whom we too, receiving the regeneration through the Holy Spirit,
desire to come all unto one perfect and heavenly man.1412</p>
<p>4. For whereas the Word of God was without flesh,1413 He took upon Himself the holy
flesh by the holy Virgin, and prepared a robe which He wove for Himself, like a bridegroom,
in the sufferings of the cross, in order that by uniting His own power with our mortal body,
and by mixing1414 the incorruptible with the corruptible, and the strong with the weak, He
might save perishing man. The web-beam, therefore, is the passion of the Lord upon the
cross, and the warp on it is the power of the Holy Spirit, and the woof is the holy flesh
wrought (woven) by the Spirit, and the thread is the grace which by the love of Christ binds
and unites the two in one, and the combs or (rods) are the Word; and the workers are the

patriarchs and prophets who weave the fair, long, perfect tunic for Christ; and the Word
passing through these, like the combs or (rods), completes through them that which His
Father willeth.1415</p>
<p>5. But as time now presses for the consideration of the question immediately in hand,
and as what has been already said in the introduction with regard to the glory of God, may
suffice, it is proper that we take the Holy Scriptures themselves in hand, and find out from
them what, and of what manner, the coming of Antichrist is; on what occasion and at what
time that impious one shall be revealed; and whence and from what tribe (he shall come);
and what his name is, which is indicated by the number in the Scripture; and how he shall
work error among the people, gathering them from the ends of the earth; and (how) he shall
stir up tribulation and persecution against the saints; and how he shall glorify himself as
God; and what his end shall be; and how the sudden appearing of the Lord shall be revealed
from heaven; and what the conflagration of the whole world shall be; and what the glorious
and heavenly kingdom of the saints is to be, when they reign together with Christ; and what
the punishment of the wicked by fire.</p>
<p>6. Now, as our Lord Jesus Christ, who is also God, was prophesied of under the figure
of a lion,1416 on account of His royalty and glory, in the same way have the Scriptures also
aforetime spoken of Antichrist as a lion, on account of his tyranny and violence. For the
deceiver seeks to liken himself in all things to the Son of God. Christ is a lion, so Antichrist
is also a lion; Christ is a king,1417 so Antichrist is also a king. The Saviour was manifested
as a lamb;1418 so he too, in like manner, will appear as a lamb, though within he is a wolf.
The Saviour came into the world in the circumcision, and he will come in the same manner.
The Lord sent apostles among all the nations, and he in like manner will send false apostles.
The Saviour gathered together the sheep that were scattered abroad,1419 and he in like
manner will bring together a people that is scattered abroad. The Lord gave a seal to those
who believed on Him, and he will give one in like manner. The Saviour appeared in the
form of man, and he too will come in the form of a man. The Saviour raised up and showed
His holy flesh like a temple,1420 and he will raise a temple of stone in Jerusalem. And his
seductive arts we shall exhibit in what follows. But for the present let us turn to the question
in hand.</p>

<p>7. Now the blessed Jacob speaks to the following effect in his benedictions, testifying
prophetically of our Lord and Saviour: “Judah, let thy brethren praise thee: thy hand shall
be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee. Judah is
a lion’s whelp: from the shoot, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as
a lion, and as a lion’s whelp; who shall rouse him up? A ruler shall not depart from Judah,
nor a leader from his thighs, until he come for whom it is reserved; and he shall be the expectation
of the nations. Binding his ass to a vine, and his ass’s colt to the vine tendril; he
shall wash his garment in wine, and his clothes in the blood of the grapes. His eyes shall be
gladsome as with wine, and his teeth shall be whiter than milk.”1421</p>
<p>8. Knowing, then, as I do, how to explain these things in detail, I deem it right at present
to quote the words themselves. But since the expressions themselves urge us to speak of
them. I shall not omit to do so. For these are truly divine and glorious things, and things
well calculated to benefit the soul. The prophet, in using the expression, a lion’s whelp, means
him who sprang from Judah and David according to the flesh, who was not made indeed
of the seed of David, but was conceived by the (power of the) Holy Ghost, and came forth1422
from the holy shoot of earth. For Isaiah says, “There shall come forth a rod out of the root
of Jesse, and a flower shall grow up out of it.”1423 That which is called by Isaiah a flower,
Jacob calls a shoot. For first he shot forth, and then he flourished in the world. And the expression,
“he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp,” refers to the three
days’ sleep (death, couching) of Christ; as also Isaiah says, “How is faithful Sion become an
harlot! it was full of judgment; in which righteousness lodged (couched); but now murderers.”
1424 And David says to the same effect, “I laid me down (couched) and slept; I awaked:
for the Lord will sustain me;”1425 in which words he points to the fact of his sleep and rising
again. And Jacob says, “Who shall rouse him up?” And that is just what David and Paul
both refer to, as when Paul says, “and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead.”1426</p>
<p>9. And in saying, “A ruler shall not depart from Judah, nor a leader from his thighs,
until he come for whom it is reserved; and he shall be the expectation of the nations,” he
referred the fulfilment (of that prophecy) to Christ. For He is our expectation. For we expect
Him, (and) by faith we behold Him as He comes from heaven with power.</p>
<p>10. “Binding his ass to a vine:” that means that He unites His people of the circumcision
with His own calling (vocation). For He was the vine.1427 “And his ass’s colt to the vine-

grape.” In the blood of what grape, then, but just His own flesh, which hung upon the tree
like a cluster of grapes?—from whose side also flowed two streams, of blood and water, in
which the nations are washed and purified, which (nations) He may be supposed to have
as a robe about Him.1429</p>
<p>12. “His eyes gladsome with wine.” And what are the eyes of Christ but the blessed
prophets, who foresaw in the Spirit, and announced beforehand, the sufferings that were to

their vocation) by the word Himself and His grace?</p>
<p>13. And in saying, “And his teeth (shall be) whiter than milk,” he referred to the commandments
that proceed from the holy mouth of Christ, and which are pure (purify) as
milk.</p>
<p>14. Thus did the Scriptures preach before-time of this lion and lion’s whelp. And in like
manner also we find it written regarding Antichrist. For Moses speaks thus: “Dan is a lion’s
whelp, and he shall leap from Bashan.”1430 But that no one may err by supposing that this
is said of the Saviour, let him attend carefully to the matter. “Dan,” he says, “is a lion’s whelp;”
and in naming the tribe of Dan, he declared clearly the tribe from which Antichrist is destined
to spring. For as Christ springs from the tribe of Judah, so Antichrist is to spring from the
tribe of Dan.1431 And that the case stands thus, we see also from the words of Jacob: “Let
Dan be a serpent, lying upon the ground, biting the horse’s heel.”1432 What, then, is meant
by the serpent but Antichrist, that deceiver who is mentioned in Genesis,1433 who deceived

to represent the Holy Ghost as the Father of Christ, Combefisius proposes, as in our rendering, κατὰ τὴν διὰ
τοῦ ἁγίου, etc. The wine, therefore, is taken as a figure of His deity, and the garment as a figure of His humanity;
and the sense would be, that He has the latter imbued with the former in a way peculiar to Himself—even as
the voice at the Jordan declared Him to be the Father’s Son, not His Son by adoption, but His own Son, anointed
as man with divinity itself.</note>

prove this assertion by sufficient testimony, we shall not shrink from the task.</p>
<p>15. That it is in reality out of the tribe of Dan, then, that that tyrant and king, that dread
judge, that son of the devil, is destined to spring and arise, the prophet testifies when he
says, “Dan shall judge his people, as (he is) also one tribe in Israel.”1434 But some one may
say that this refers to Samson, who sprang from the tribe of Dan, and judged the people
twenty years. Well, the prophecy had its partial fulfilment in Samson, but its complete fulfilment
is reserved for Antichrist. For Jeremiah also speaks to this effect: “From Dan we are
to hear the sound of the swiftness of his horses: the whole land trembled at the sound of the
neighing, of the driving of his horses.”1435 And another prophet says: “He shall gather together
all his strength, from the east even to the west. They whom he calls, and they whom he calls
not, shall go with him. He shall make the sea white with the sails of his ships, and the plain
black with the shields of his armaments. And whosoever shall oppose him in war shall fall
by the sword.”1436 That these things, then, are said of no one else but that tyrant, and
shameless one, and adversary of God, we shall show in what follows.</p>
<p>16. But Isaiah also speaks thus: “And it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath
performed His whole work upon Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, He will punish (visit) the
stout mind, the king of Assyria, and the greatness (height) of the glory of his eyes. For he
said, By my strength will I do it, and by the wisdom of my understanding I will remove the
bounds of the peoples, and will rob them of their strength: and I will make the inhabited
cities tremble, and will gather the whole world in my hand like a nest, and I will lift it up
like eggs that are left. And there is no one that shall escape or gainsay me, and open the
mouth and chatter. Shall the axe boast itself without him that heweth therewith? or shall the
saw magnify itself without him that shaketh (draweth) it? As if one should raise a rod or a
staff, and the staff should lift itself up: and not thus. But the Lord shall send dishonour unto
thy honour; and into thy glory a burning fire shall burn. And the light of Israel shall be a
fire, and shall sanctify him in flame, and shall consume the forest like grass.”1437</p>
<p>17. And again he says in another place: “How hath the exactor ceased, and how hath
the oppressor ceased!1438 God hath broken the yoke of the rulers of sinners, He who smote
the people in wrath, and with an incurable stroke: He that strikes the people with an incurable
stroke, which He did not spare. He ceased (rested) confidently: the whole earth shouts with
rejoicing. The trees of Lebanon rejoiced at thee, and the cedar of Lebanon, (saying), Since

thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us. Hell from beneath is moved at meeting
thee: all the mighty ones, the rulers of the earth, are gathered together—the lords from their
thrones. All the kings of the nations, all they shall answer together, and shall say, And thou,
too, art taken as we; and thou art reckoned among us. Thy pomp is brought down to earth,
thy great rejoicing: they will spread decay under thee; and the worm shall be thy covering.1439
How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!1440 He is cast down to the
ground who sends off to all the nations. And thou didst say in thy mind, I will ascend into
heaven, I will set my throne above the stars of heaven: I will sit down upon the lofty moun-
tains towards the north: I will ascend above the clouds: I will be like the Most High. Yet now
thou shalt be brought down to hell, and to the foundations of the earth! They that see thee
shall wonder at thee, and shall say, This is the man that excited the earth, that did shake
kings, that made the whole world a wilderness, and destroyed the cities, that released not
those in prison.1441 All the kings of the earth did lie in honour, every one in his own house;
but thou shalt be cast out on the mountains like a loathsome carcase, with many who fall,
pierced through with the sword, and going down to hell. As a garment stained with blood
is not pure, so neither shalt thou be comely (or clean); because thou hast destroyed my land,
and slain my people. Thou shalt not abide, enduring for ever, a wicked seed. Prepare thy
children for slaughter, for the sins of thy father, that they rise not, neither possess my

<p>18. Ezekiel also speaks of him to the same effect, thus: “Thus saith the Lord God, Because
thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst
of the sea; yet art thou a man, and not God, (though) thou hast set thine heart as the heart
of God. Art thou wiser than Daniel? Have the wise not instructed thee in their wisdom?
With thy wisdom or with thine understanding hast thou gotten thee power, and gold and
silver in thy treasures? By thy great wisdom and by thy traffic1443 hast thou increased thy
power? Thy heart is lifted up in thy power. Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because thou
hast set thine heart as the heart of God: behold, therefore I will bring strangers1444 upon
thee, plagues from the nations: and they shall draw their swords against thee, and against
the beauty of thy wisdom; and they shall level thy beauty to destruction; and they shall bring
thee down; and thou shalt die by the death of the wounded in the midst of the sea. Wilt thou
yet say before them that slay thee, I am God? But thou art a man, and no God, in the hand

of them that wound thee. Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord.”1445</p>
<p>19. These words then being thus presented, let us observe somewhat in detail what
Daniel says in his visions. For in distinguishing the kingdoms that are to rise after these
things, he showed also the coming of Antichrist in the last times, and the consummation
of the whole world. In expounding the vision of Nebuchadnezzar, then, he speaks thus:
“Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image standing before thy face: the head of which
was of fine gold, its arms and shoulders of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, and its legs
of iron, (and) its feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest, then, till that a stone was
cut out without hands, and smote the image upon the feet that were of iron and clay, and
brake them to an end. Then were the clay, the iron, the brass, the silver, (and) the gold
broken, and became like the chaff from the summer threshing-floor; and the strength (fulness)
of the wind carried them away, and there was no place found for them. And the stone that
smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.”1446</p>
<p>20. Now if we set Daniel’s own visions also side by side with this, we shall have one exposition
to give of the two together, and shall (be able to) show how concordant with each
other they are, and how true. For he speaks thus: “I Daniel saw, and behold the four winds
of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse
one from another. The first (was) like a lioness, and had wings as of an eagle. I beheld till
the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon
the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it. And behold a second beast like to a bear,
and it was made stand on one part, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it.1447 I beheld,
and lo a beast like a leopard, and it had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl, and the
beast had four heads. After this I saw, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and
strong exceedingly; it had iron teeth and claws of brass,1448 which devoured and brake in
pieces, and it stamped the residue with the feet of it; and it was diverse from all the beasts
that were before it, and it had ten horns. I considered its horns, and behold there came up
among them another little horn, and before it there were three of the first horns plucked up
by the roots; and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking
great things.”1449</p>

occur subsequently in the explanation of the vision (v. 19).</note>

<pb n="525"/>
<p>21. “I beheld till the thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit: and His garment
was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool: His throne was a flame of fire,
His wheels were a burning fire. A stream of fire flowed before Him. Thousand thousands
ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood around Him: the judgment
was set, and the books were opened. I beheld then, because of the voice of the great words
which the horn spake, till the beast was slain and perished, and his body given to the burning
of fire. And the dominion of the other beasts was taken away.”1450</p>
<p>22. “I saw in the night vision, and, behold, one like the Son of man was coming with
the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and was brought near before Him.
And there was given Him dominion, and honour, and the kingdom; and all peoples, tribes,
and tongues shall serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.”1451</p>
<p>23. Now since these things, spoken as they are with a mystical meaning, may seem to
some hard to understand, we shall keep back nothing fitted to impart an intelligent apprehension
of them to those who are possessed of a sound mind. He said, then, that a “lioness
came up from the sea,” and by that he meant the kingdom of the Babylonians in the world,
which also was the head of gold on the image. In saying that “it had wings as of an eagle,”
he meant that Nebuchadnezzar the king was lifted up and was exalted against God. Then
he says, “the wings thereof were plucked,” that is to say, his glory was destroyed; for he was
driven out of his kingdom. And the words, “a man’s heart was given to it, and it was made
stand upon the feet as a man,” refer to the fact that he repented and recognised himself to
be only a man, and gave the glory to God.</p>
<p>24. Then, after the lioness, he sees a “second beast like a bear,” and that denoted the
Persians. For after the Babylonians, the Persians held the sovereign power. And in saying
that there were “three ribs in the mouth of it,” he pointed to three nations, viz., the Persians,
and the Medes, and the Babylonians; which were also represented on the image by the silver
after the gold. Then (there was) “the third beast, a leopard,” which meant the Greeks. For
after the Persians, Alexander of Macedon obtained the sovereign power on subverting
Darius, as is also shown by the brass on the image. And in saying that it had “four wings of
a fowl,” he taught us most clearly how the kingdom of Alexander was partitioned. For in
speaking of “four heads,” he made mention of four kings, viz., those who arose out of that
(kingdom).1452 For Alexander, when dying, partitioned out his kingdom into four divisions.</p>
<note type="footnote">1450 Dan. vii. 9–12.</note>

<note type="footnote">1452 See Curtius, x. 10. That Alexander himself divided his kingdom is asserted by Josephus Gorionides (iii.)
and Cyril of Jerusalem (Catech., 4, De Sacra Scriptura) and others.</note>

<pb n="526"/>
<p>25. Then he says: “A fourth beast, dreadful and terrible; it had iron teeth and claws of
brass.” And who are these but the Romans? which (kingdom) is meant by the iron—the
kingdom which is now established; for the legs of that (image) were of iron. And after this,
what remains, beloved, but the toes of the feet of the image, in which part is iron and part
clay, mixed together? And mystically by the toes of the feet he meant the kings who are to
arise from among them; as Daniel also says (in the words), “I considered the beast, and lo
there were ten horns behind it, among which shall rise another (horn), an offshoot, and
shall pluck up by the roots the three (that were) before it.” And under this was signified
none other than Antichrist, who is also himself to raise the kingdom of the Jews. He says
that three horns are plucked up by the root by him, viz., the three kings of Egypt, and Libya,
and Ethiopia, whom he cuts off in the array of battle. And he, after gaining terrible power
over all, being nevertheless a tyrant,1453 shall stir up tribulation and persecution against
men, exalting himself against them. For Daniel says: “I considered the horn, and behold
that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them, till the beast was slain and
perished, and its body was given to the burning of fire.”1454</p>
<p>26. After a little space the stone1455 will come from heaven which smites the image and
breaks it in pieces, and subverts all the kingdoms, and gives the kingdom to the saints of
the Most High. This is the stone which becomes a great mountain, and fills the whole earth,
of which Daniel says: “I saw in the night visions, and behold one like the Son of man came
with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and was brought near before
Him. And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; and all peoples, tribes,
and languages shall serve Him: and His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall
not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.”1456 He showed all power given by
the Father to the Son,1457 who is ordained Lord of things in heaven, and things on earth,
and things under the earth, and Judge of all:1458 of things in heaven, because He was born,
the Word of God, before all (ages); and of things on earth, because He became man in the
midst of men, to re-create our Adam through Himself; and of things under the earth, because
He was also reckoned among the dead, preaching the Gospel to the souls of the saints,1459
(and) by death overcoming death.</p>

<p>27. As these things, then, are in the future, and as the ten toes of the image are equivalent
to (so many) democracies,1460 and the ten horns of the fourth beast are distributed over ten
kingdoms, let us look at the subject a little more closely, and consider these matters as in
the clear light of a personal survey.1461</p>
<p>28. The golden head of the image and the lioness denoted the Babylonians; the shoulders
and arms of silver, and the bear, represented the Persians and Medes; the belly and thighs
of brass, and the leopard, meant the Greeks, who held the sovereignty from Alexander’s
time; the legs of iron, and the beast dreadful and terrible, expressed the Romans, who hold
the sovereignty at present; the toes of the feet which were part clay and part iron, and the
ten horns, were emblems of the kingdoms that are yet to rise; the other little horn that grows
up among them meant the Antichrist in their midst; the stone that smites the earth and
brings judgment upon the world was Christ.</p>
<p>29. These things, beloved, we impart to you with fear, and yet readily, on account of the
love of Christ, which surpasseth all. For if the blessed prophets who preceded us did not
choose to proclaim these things, though they knew them, openly and boldly, lest they should
disquiet the souls of men, but recounted them mystically in parables and dark sayings,
speaking thus, “Here is the mind which hath wisdom,”1462 how much greater risk shall we
run in venturing to declare openly things spoken by them in obscure terms! Let us look,
therefore, at the things which are to befall this unclean harlot in the last days; and (let us
consider) what and what manner of tribulation is destined to visit her in the wrath of God
before the judgment as an earnest of her doom.</p>
<p>30. Come, then, O blessed Isaiah; arise, tell us clearly what thou didst prophesy with
respect to the mighty Babylon. For thou didst speak also of Jerusalem, and thy word is accomplished.
For thou didst speak boldly and openly: “Your country is desolate, your cities
are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate as
overthrown by many strangers.1463 The daughter of Sion shall be left as a cottage in a vineyard,
and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.”1464 What then? Are not
these things come to pass? Are not the things announced by thee fulfilled? Is not their
country, Judea, desolate? Is not the holy place burned with fire? Are not their walls cast
down? Are not their cities destroyed? Their land, do not strangers devour it? Do not the

if I should esteem Jeremiah most, yet Daniel too has his testimony. Daniel, I commend thee
above all; yet John too gives no false witness. With how many mouths and tongues would
I praise you; or rather the Word who spake in you! Ye died with Christ; and ye will live with
Christ. Hear ye, and rejoice; behold the things announced by you have been fulfilled in their
time. For ye saw these things yourselves first, and then ye proclaimed them to all generations.
Ye ministered the oracles of God to all generations. Ye prophets were called, that ye might
be able to save all. For then is one a prophet indeed, when, having announced beforetime
things about to be, he can afterwards show that they have actually happened. Ye were the
disciples of a good Master. These words I address to you as if alive, and with propriety. For
ye hold already the crown of life and immortality which is laid up for you in heaven.1465</p>
<p>32. Speak with me, O blessed Daniel. Give me full assurance, I beseech thee. Thou dost
prophesy concerning the lioness in Babylon;1466 for thou wast a captive there. Thou hast
unfolded the future regarding the bear; for thou wast still in the world, and didst see the
things come to pass. Then thou speakest to me of the leopard; and whence canst thou know
this, for thou art already gone to thy rest? Who instructed thee to announce these things,
but He who formed1467 thee in (from) thy mother’s womb?1468 That is God, thou sayest.
Thou hast spoken indeed, and that not falsely. The leopard has arisen; the he-goat is come;
he hath smitten the ram; he hath broken his horns in pieces; he hath stamped upon him
with his feet. He has been exalted by his fall; (the) four horns have come up from under that
one.1469 Rejoice, blessed Daniel! thou hast not been in error: all these things have come to
pass.</p>
<p>33. After this again thou hast told me of the beast dreadful and terrible. “It had iron
teeth and claws of brass: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the
feet of it.”1470 Already the iron rules; already it subdues and breaks all in pieces; already it
brings all the unwilling into subjection; already we see these things ourselves. Now we
glorify God, being instructed by thee.</p>

<p>34. But as the task before us was to speak of the harlot, be thou with us, O blessed Isaiah.
Let us mark what thou sayest about Babylon. “Come down, sit upon the ground, O virgin
daughter of Babylon; sit, O daughter of the Chaldeans; thou shalt no longer be called tender
and delicate. Take the millstone, grind meal, draw aside thy veil,1471 shave the grey hairs,
make bare the legs, pass over the rivers. Thy shame shall be uncovered, thy reproach shall
be seen: I will take justice of thee, I will no more give thee over to men. As for thy Redeemer,
(He is) the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel is his name. Sit thou in compunction, get
thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: thou shalt no longer be called the strength
of the kingdom.</p>
<p>35. “I was wroth with my people; I have polluted mine inheritance, I have given them
into thine hand: and thou didst show them no mercy; but upon the ancient (the elders) thou
hast very heavily laid thy yoke. And thou saidst, I shall be a princess for ever: thou didst not
lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember thy latter end. Therefore hear now
this, thou that art delicate; that sittest, that art confident, that sayest in thine heart, I am,
and there is none else; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children.
But now these two things shall come upon thee in one day, widowhood and the loss of
children: they shall come upon thee suddenly in thy sorcery, in the strength of thine enchantments
mightily, in the hope of thy fornication. For thou hast said, I am, and there is none
else. And thy fornication shall be thy shame, because thou hast said in thy heart, I am. And
destruction shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not know it. (And there shall be) a pit, and
thou shalt fall into it; and misery shall fall upon thee, and thou shalt not be able to be made
clean; and destruction shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not know it. Stand now with thy
enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, which thou hast learned from thy
youth; if so be thou shalt be able to be profited. Thou art wearied in thy counsels. Let the
astrologers of the heavens stand and save thee; let the star-gazers announce to thee what
shall come upon thee. Behold, they shall all be as sticks for the fire; so shall they be burned,
and they shall not deliver their soul from the flame. Because thou hast coals of fire, sit upon
them; so shall it be for thy help. Thou art wearied with change from thy youth. Man has
gone astray (each one) by himself; and there shall be no salvation for thee.”1472 These things
does Isaiah prophesy for thee. Let us see now whether John has spoken to the same effect.</p>
<p>36. For he sees, when in the isle Patmos, a revelation of awful mysteries, which he recounts
freely, and makes known to others. Tell me, blessed John, apostle and disciple of the
Lord, what didst thou see and hear concerning Babylon? Arise, and speak; for it sent thee
also into banishment.1473 “And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,

committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the
wine of her fornication. And he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw
a woman sit upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads
and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with
gold, and precious stone,1474 and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations
and filthiness1475 of the fornication of the earth. Upon her forehead was a name

of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns. The beast that
thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition:
and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder (whose name was not written in the book of
life from the foundation of the world) when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and
yet shall be.1476</p>
<p>38. “And here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on
which the woman sitteth. And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the
other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. And the beast
that was and is not, (even he is the eighth,) and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet;
but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give
their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb
shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with Him
are called, and chosen, and faithful.</p>
<p>39. “And he saith to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are
peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. And the ten horns which thou sawest,
and1477 the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and
shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil His will,
and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the
earth.</p>

<p>40. “After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power;
and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily1478 with a strong voice,
saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the
hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have
drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance
of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my
people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: for her
sins did cleave even unto heaven,1479 and God hath remembered her iniquities.</p>
<p>41. “Reward her even as she rewarded (you), and double unto her double, according to
her works: in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. How much she hath glorified
herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her
heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues
come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with
fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. And the kings of the earth, who have
committed fornication, and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her,
when they shall see the smoke of her burning, standing afar off for the fear of her torment,
saying, Alas, alas! that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment
come. And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man shall buy
their merchandise1480 any more. The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones,
and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all

lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly have perished1483
from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all. The merchants of these things,
which were made rich1484 by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping
and wailing, and saying, Alas, alas! that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple,
and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! for in one hour so great

riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors,
and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, and cried, when they saw the smoke of her
burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city? And they cast dust on their heads,
and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas! that great city, wherein were made rich
all that had ships in the sea by reason of her fatness!1485 for in one hour is she made desolate.</p>
<p>42. “Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye angels,1486 and apostles, and prophets; for
God hath avenged you on her. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone,
and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown
down, and shall be found no more at all. And the voice of harpers and musicians, and of
pipers and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever
craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no
more at all in thee; and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice
of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants
were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. And in her
was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.”1487</p>
<p>43. With respect, then, to the particular judgment in the torments that are to come upon
it in the last times by the hand of the tyrants who shall arise then, the clearest statement has
been given in these passages. But it becomes us further diligently to examine and set forth
the period at which these things shall come to pass, and how the little horn shall spring up
in their midst. For when the legs of iron have issued in the feet and toes, according to the
similitude of the image and that of the terrible beast, as has been shown in the above, (then
shall be the time) when the iron and the clay shall be mingled together. Now Daniel will set
forth this subject to us. For he says, “And one week will make1488 a covenant with many,
and it shall be that in the midst (half) of the week my sacrifice and oblation shall cease.”1489
By one week, therefore, he meant the last week which is to be at the end of the whole world
of which week the two prophets Enoch and Elias will take up the half. For they will preach
1, 260 days clothed in sackcloth, proclaiming repentance to the people and to all the nations.</p>
<p>44. For as two advents of our Lord and Saviour are indicated in the Scriptures, the one
being His first advent in the flesh, which took place without honour by reason of His being
set at nought, as Isaiah spake of Him aforetime, saying, “We saw Him, and He had no form
nor comeliness, but His form was despised (and) rejected (lit. = deficient) above all men; a
man smitten and familiar with bearing infirmity, (for His face was turned away); He was

<pb n="533"/>
despised, and esteemed not.”1490 But His second advent is announced as glorious, when He
shall come from heaven with the host of angels, and the glory of His Father, as the prophet
saith, “Ye shall see the King in glory;”1491 and, “I saw one like the Son of man coming with
the clouds of heaven; and he came to the Ancient of days, and he was brought to Him. And
there were given Him dominion, and honour, and glory, and the kingdom; all tribes and
languages shall serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
away.”1492 Thus also two forerunners were indicated. The first was John the son of
Zacharias, who appeared in all things a forerunner and herald of our Saviour, preaching of
the heavenly light that had appeared in the world. He first fulfilled the course of forerunner,
and that from his mother’s womb, being conceived by Elisabeth, in order that to those, too,
who are children from their mother’s womb he might declare the new birth that was to take
place for their sakes by the Holy Ghost and the Virgin.</p>
<p>45. He, on hearing the salutation addressed to Elisabeth, leaped with joy in his mother’s
womb, recognising God the Word conceived in the womb of the Virgin. Thereafter he came
forward preaching in the wilderness, proclaiming the baptism of repentance to the people,
(and thus) announcing prophetically salvation to the nations living in the wilderness of the
world. After this, at the Jordan, seeing the Saviour with his own eye, he points Him out, and
says, “Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!”1493 He also first
preached to those in Hades,1494 becoming a forerunner there when he was put to death by
Herod, that there too he might intimate that the Saviour would descend to ransom the souls
of the saints from the hand of death.</p>
<p>46. But since the Saviour was the beginning of the resurrection of all men, it was meet
that the Lord alone should rise from the dead, by whom too the judgment is to enter for the
whole world, that they who have wrestled worthily may be also crowned worthily by Him,
by the illustrious Arbiter, to wit, who Himself first accomplished the course, and was received
into the heavens, and was set down on the right hand of God the Father, and is to be manifested
again at the end of the world as Judge. It is a matter of course that His forerunners
must appear first, as He says by Malachi and the angel,1495 “I will send to you Elias the
<note type="footnote">1490 Isa. liii. 2–5.</note>

dead. See Leo Allatius, De libris Eccles. Græcorum, p. 303.</note>
<note type="footnote">1495 Or it may be, “Malachi, even the messenger.” ᾽Αγγέλου is the reading restored by Combefisius instead
of ᾽Αγγαίου. The words of the angel in Luke i. 17 (“and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just”) are thus inserted
in the citation from Malachi; and to that Hippolytus may refer in the addition “and the angel.” Or perhaps,
as Combefisius rather thinks, the addition simply refers to the meaning of the name Malachi, viz., messenger.</note>

<pb n="534"/>
Tishbite before the day of the Lord, the great and notable day, comes; and he shall turn the
hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, lest I
come and smite the earth utterly.”1496 These, then, shall come and proclaim the manifestation
of Christ that is to be from heaven; and they shall also perform signs and wonders, in order
that men may be put to shame and turned to repentance for their surpassing wickedness
and impiety.</p>
<p>47. For John says, “And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy
a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.”1497 That is the half of
the week whereof Daniel spake. “These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks
standing before the Lord of the earth. And if any man will hurt them, fire will proceed out
of their mouth, and devour their enemies; and if any man will hurt them, he must in this
manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their
prophecy; and have power over waters, to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with
all plagues as often as they will. And when they shall have finished their course and their
testimony,” what saith the prophet? “the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall
make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them,”1498 because they will not
give glory to Antichrist. For this is meant by the little horn that grows up. He, being now
elated in heart, begins to exalt himself, and to glorify himself as God, persecuting the saints
and blaspheming Christ, even as Daniel says, “I considered the horn, and, behold, in the
horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things; and he opened his
mouth to blaspheme God. And that born made war against the saints, and prevailed against
them until the beast was slain, and perished, and his body was given to be burned.”1499</p>
<p>48. But as it is incumbent on us to discuss this matter of the beast more exactly, and in
particular the question how the Holy Spirit has also mystically indicated his name by means
of a number, we shall proceed to state more clearly what bears upon him. John then speaks
thus: “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns, like a
lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exercised all the power of the first beast before him;
and he made the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly
wound was healed. And he did great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from
heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by means
of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast, saying to them that
dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a
sword and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image

<note type="footnote">1499 Dan. vii. 8, 9.</note>

<pb n="535"/>
of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of
the beast should be killed. And he caused all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead; and that no man might buy
or sell, save he that had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here
is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast; for if is the
number of a man, and his number is six hundred threescore and six.”1500</p>
<p>49. By the beast, then, coming up out of the earth, he means the kingdom of Antichrist;
and by the two horns he means him and the false prophet after him.1501 And in speaking
of “the horns being like a lamb,” he means that he will make himself like the Son of God,
and set himself forward as king. And the terms, “he spake like a dragon,” mean that he is a
deceiver, and not truthful. And the words, “he exercised all the power of the first beast before
him, and caused the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose
deadly wound was healed,” signify that, after the manner of the law of Augustus, by whom
the empire of Rome was established, he too will rule and govern, sanctioning everything by
it, and taking greater glory to himself. For this is the fourth beast, whose head was wounded
and healed again, in its being broken up or even dishonoured, and partitioned into four
crowns; and he then (Antichrist) shall with knavish skill heal it, as it were, and restore it.
For this is what is meant by the prophet when he says, “He will give life unto the image, and
the image of the beast will speak.” For he will act with vigour again, and prove strong by
reason of the laws established by him; and he will cause all those who will not worship the
image of the beast to be put to death. Here the faith and the patience of the saints will appear,
for he says: “And he will cause all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to
receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead; that no man might buy or sell, save
he that had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” For, being full of
guile, and exalting himself against the servants of God, with the wish to afflict them and
persecute them out of the world, because they give not glory to him, he will order incensepans1502
to be set up by all everywhere, that no man among the saints may be able to buy
or sell without first sacrificing; for this is what is meant by the mark received upon the right
hand. And the word—“in their forehead”—indicates that all are crowned, and put on a
crown of fire, and not of life, but of death. For in this wise, too, did Antiochus Epiphanes
the king of Syria, the descendant of Alexander of Macedon, devise measures against the
Jews. He, too, in the exaltation of his heart, issued a decree in those times, that “all should

<pb n="536"/>
set up shrines before their doors, and sacrifice, and that they should march in procession
to the honour of Dionysus, waving chaplets of ivy;” and that those who refused obedience
should be put to death by strangulation and torture. But he also met his due recompense at
the hand of the Lord, the righteous Judge and all-searching God; for he died eaten up of
worms. And if one desires to inquire into that more accurately, he will find it recorded in
the books of the Maccabees.1503</p>
<p>50. But now we shall speak of what is before us. For such measures will he, too, devise,
seeking to afflict the saints in every way. For the prophet and apostle says: “Here is wisdom,
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a
man, and his number is six hundred threescore and six.” With respect to his name, it is not
in our power to explain it exactly, as the blessed John understood it and was instructed about
it, but only to give a conjectural account of it;1504 for when he appears, the blessed one will
show us what we seek to know. Yet as far as our doubtful apprehension of the matter goes,
we may speak. Many names indeed we find,1505 the letters of which are the equivalent of
this number: such as, for instance, the word Titan,1506 an ancient and notable name; or
Evanthas,1507 for it too makes up the same number; and many others which might be found.
But, as we have already said,1508 the wound of the first beast was healed, and he (the second
beast) was to make the image speak,1509 that is to say, he should be powerful; and it is
manifest to all that those who at present still hold the power are Latins. If, then, we take the
name as the name of a single man, it becomes Latinus. Wherefore we ought neither to give
it out as if this were certainly his name, nor again ignore the fact that he may not be otherwise
designated. But having the mystery of God in our heart, we ought in fear to keep faithfully
what has been told us by the blessed prophets, in order that when those things come to pass,
we may be prepared for them, and not deceived. For when the times advance, he too, of
whom these thing are said, will be manifested.1510</p>

<pb n="537"/>
<p>51. But not to confine ourselves to these words and arguments alone, for the purpose
of convincing those who love to study the oracles of God, we shall demonstrate the matter
by many other proofs. For Daniel says, “And these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom,
and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.”1511 Ammon and Moab1512 are the
children born to Lot by his daughters, and their race survives even now. And Isaiah says:
“And they shall fly in the boats of strangers, plundering the sea together, and (they shall
spoil) them of the east: and they shall lay hands upon Moab first; and the children of Ammon
shall first obey them.”1513</p>
<p>52. In those times, then, he shall arise and meet them. And when he has overmastered
three horns out of the ten in the array of war, and has rooted these out, viz., Egypt, and
Libya, and Ethiopia, and has got their spoils and trappings, and has brought the remaining
horns which suffer into subjection, he will begin to be lifted up in heart, and to exalt himself
against God as master of the whole world. And his first expedition will be against Tyre and
Berytus, and the circumjacent territory. For by storming these cities first he will strike terror
into the others, as Isaiah says, “Be thou ashamed, O Sidon; the sea hath spoken, even the
strength of the sea hath spoken, saying, I travailed not, nor brought forth children; neither
did I nurse up young men, nor bring up virgins. But when the report comes to Egypt, pain
shall seize them for Tyre.”1514</p>
<p>53. These things, then, shall be in the future, beloved; and when the three horns are cut
off, he will begin to show himself as God, as Ezekiel has said aforetime: “Because thy heart
has been lifted up, and thou hast said, I am God.”1515 And to the like effect Isaiah says: “For
thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars
of heaven: I will be like the Most High. Yet now thou shalt be brought down to hell (Hades),
to the foundations of the earth.”1516 In like manner also Ezekiel: “Wilt thou yet say to those
who slay thee, I am God? But thou (shalt be) a man, and no God.”1517</p>
<p>54. As his tribe, then, and his manifestation, and his destruction, have been set forth in
these words, and as his name has also been indicated mystically, let us look also at his action.
For he will call together all the people to himself, out of every country of the dispersion,
making them his own, as though they were his own children, and promising to restore their
country, and establish again their kingdom and nation, in order that he may be worshipped

by them as God, as the prophet says: “He will collect his whole kingdom, from the rising of
the sun even to its setting: they whom he summons and they whom he does not summon
shall march with him.”1518 And Jeremiah speaks of him thus in a parable: “The partridge
cried, (and) gathered what he did not hatch, making himself riches without judgment: in
the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.”1519</p>
<p>55. It will not be detrimental, therefore, to the course of our present argument, if we
explain the art of that creature, and show that the prophet has not spoken1520 without a
purpose in using the parable (or similitude) of the creature. For as the partridge is a vainglorious
creature, when it sees near at hand the nest of another partridge with young in it,
and with the parent-bird away on the wing in quest of food, it imitates the cry of the other
bird, and calls the young to itself; and they, taking it to be their own parent, run to it. And
it delights itself proudly in the alien pullets as in its own. But when the real parent-bird returns,
and calls them with its own familiar cry, the young recognise it, and forsake the deceiver,
and betake themselves to the real parent. This thing, then, the prophet has adopted
as a simile, applying it in a similar manner to Antichrist. For he will allure mankind to
himself, wishing to gain possession of those who are not his own, and promising deliverance
to all, while he is unable to save himself.</p>
<p>56. He then, having gathered to himself the unbelieving everywhere throughout the
world, comes at their call to persecute the saints, their enemies and antagonists, as the apostle
and evangelist says: “There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded
man: and there was a widow in that city, who came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine
adversary. And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I
fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her.”1521</p>
<p>57. By the unrighteous judge, who fears not God, neither regards man, he means without
doubt Antichrist, as he is a son of the devil and a vessel of Satan. For when he has the power,
he will begin to exalt himself against God, neither in truth fearing God, nor regarding the
Son of God, who is the Judge of all. And in saying that there was a widow in the city, he
refers to Jerusalem itself, which is a widow indeed, forsaken of her perfect, heavenly spouse,
God. She calls Him her adversary, and not her Saviour; for she does not understand that
which was said by the prophet Jeremiah: “Because they obeyed not the truth, a spirit of error
shall speak then to this people and to Jerusalem.”1522 And Isaiah also to the like effect:
“Forasmuch as the people refuseth to drink the water of Siloam that goeth softly, but chooseth

to have Rasin and Romeliah’s son as king over you: therefore, lo, the Lord bringeth up upon
you the water of the river, strong and full, even the king of Assyria.”1523 By the king he
means metaphorically Antichrist, as also another prophet saith: “And this man shall be the
peace from me, when the Assyrian shall come up into your land, and when he shall tread
in your mountains.”1524</p>
<p>58. And in like manner Moses, knowing beforehand that the people would reject and
disown the true Saviour of the world, and take part with error, and choose an earthly king,
and set the heavenly King at nought, says: “Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed
up among my treasures? In the day of vengeance I will recompense (them), and in the time
when their foot shall slide.”1525 They did slide, therefore, in all things, as they were found
to be in harmony with the truth in nothing: neither as concerns the law, because they became
transgressors; nor as concerns the prophets, because they cut off even the prophets themselves;
nor as concerns the voice of the Gospels, because they crucified the Saviour Himself;
nor in believing the apostles, because they persecuted them. At all times they showed
themselves enemies and betrayers of the truth, and were found to be haters of God, and not
lovers of Him; and such they shall be then when they find opportunity: for, rousing themselves
against the servants of God, they will seek to obtain vengeance by the hand of a mortal
man. And he, being puffed up with pride by their subserviency, will begin to despatch
missives against the saints, commanding to cut them all off everywhere, on the ground of
their refusal to reverence and worship him as God, according to the word of Esaias: “Woe
to the wings of the vessels of the land,1526 beyond the rivers of Ethiopia: (woe to him) who
sendeth sureties by the sea, and letters of papyrus (upon the water; for nimble messengers
will go) to a nation1527 anxious and expectant, and a people strange and bitter against them;
a nation hopeless and trodden down.”1528</p>
<p>59. But we who hope for the Son of God are persecuted and trodden down by those
unbelievers. For the wings of the vessels are the churches; and the sea is the world, in which
the Church is set, like a ship tossed in the deep, but not destroyed; for she has with her the
skilled Pilot, Christ. And she bears in her midst also the trophy (which is erected) over death;

for she carries with her the cross of the Lord.1529 For her prow is the east, and her stern is
the west, and her hold1530 is the south, and her tillers are the two Testaments; and the ropes
that stretch around her are the love of Christ, which binds the Church; and the net1531 which
she bears with her is the laver of the regeneration which renews the believing, whence too
are these glories. As the wind the Spirit from heaven is present, by whom those who believe
are sealed: she has also anchors of iron accompanying her, viz., the holy commandments
of Christ Himself, which are strong as iron. She has also mariners on the right and on the
left, assessors like the holy angels, by whom the Church is always governed and defended.
The ladder in her leading up to the sailyard is an emblem of the passion of Christ, which
brings the faithful to the ascent of heaven. And the top-sails1532 aloft1533 upon the yard are
the company of prophets, martyrs, and apostles, who have entered into their rest in the
kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p>60. Now, concerning the tribulation of the persecution which is to fall upon the Church
from the adversary, John also speaks thus: “And I saw a great and wondrous sign in heaven;
a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown
of twelve stars. And she, being with child, cries, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her
child as soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man-child, who is to rule all the nations:
and the child was caught up unto God and to His throne. And the woman fled into the
wilderness, where she hath the place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a
thousand two hundred and threescore days. And then when the dragon saw it, he persecuted
the woman which brought forth the man-child. And to the woman were given two wings
of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, where she is nourished for a time,
and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast (out of his
mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the
flood. And the earth helped the woman, and opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood
which the dragon cast) out of his mouth. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and
went to make war with the saints of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and
have the testimony of Jesus.”1534</p>

<p>61. By the woman then clothed with the sun,” he meant most manifestly the Church,
endued with the Father’s word,1535 whose brightness is above the sun. And by the “moon
under her feet” he referred to her being adorned, like the moon, with heavenly glory. And
the words, “upon her head a crown of twelve stars,” refer to the twelve apostles by whom
the Church was founded. And those, “she, being with child, cries, travailing in birth, and
pained to be delivered,” mean that the Church will not cease to bear from her heart1536 the
Word that is persecuted by the unbelieving in the world. “And she brought forth,” he says,
“a man-child, who is to rule all the nations;” by which is meant that the Church, always
bringing forth Christ, the perfect man-child of God, who is declared to be God and man,
becomes the instructor of all the nations. And the words, “her child was caught up unto
God and to His throne,” signify that he who is always born of her is a heavenly king, and
not an earthly; even as David also declared of old when he said, “The Lord said unto my
Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”1537 “And the
dragon,” he says, “saw and persecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child. And
to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness,
where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.”1538
That refers to the one thousand two hundred and threescore days (the half of the week)
during which the tyrant is to reign and persecute the Church,1539 which flees from city to
city, and seeks concealment in the wilderness among the mountains, possessed of no other
defence than the two wings of the great eagle, that is to say, the faith of Jesus Christ, who,
in stretching forth His holy hands on the holy tree, unfolded two wings, the right and the
left, and called to Him all who believed upon Him, and covered them as a hen her chickens.
For by the mouth of Malachi also He speaks thus: “And unto you that fear my name shall
the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings.”1540</p>
<p>62. The Lord also says, “When ye shall see the abomination of desolation stand in the
holy place (whoso readeth, let him understand), then let them which be in Judea flee into
the mountains, and let him which is on the housetop not come down to take his clothes;
neither let him which is in the field return back to take anything out of his house. And woe
unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for then shall be
great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world. And except those days

place the abomination of desolation a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Blessed is he
that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand two hundred and ninety-five days.”1542</p>
<p>63. And the blessed Apostle Paul, writing to the Thessalonians, says: “Now we beseech
you, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together
at it,1543 that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word,
nor by letters as from us, as that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man deceive you by
any means; for (that day shall not come) except there come the falling away first, and that
man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all
that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he sitteth in the temple of God, showing
himself that he is God. Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these
things? And now ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time. For the
mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth (will let), until he be taken
out of the way. And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall consume
with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: (even
him) whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders,
and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received
not the love of the truth. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness.”1544 And Esaias says, “Let the wicked be cut off, that he behold
not the glory of the Lord.”1545</p>
<p>64. These things, then, being to come to pass, beloved, and the one week being divided
into two parts, and the abomination of desolation being manifested then, and the two
prophets and forerunners of the Lord having finished their course, and the whole world finally
approaching the consummation, what remains but the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ from heaven, for whom we have looked in hope? who shall bring the conflagration
and just judgment upon all who have refused to believe on Him. For the Lord says, “And
when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
draweth nigh.”1546 “And there shall not a hair of your head perish.”1547 “For as

the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming
of the Son of man be. For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.”
1548 Now the fall1549 took place in paradise; for Adam fell there. And He says again,
“Then shall the Son of man send His angels, and they shall gather together His elect from
the four winds of heaven.”1550 And David also, in announcing prophetically the judgment
and coming of the Lord, says, “His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His circuit
unto the end of the heaven: and there is no one hid from the heat thereof.”1551 By the heat
he means the conflagration. And Esaias speaks thus: “Come, my people, enter thou into
thy chamber, (and) shut thy door: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation
of the Lord be overpast.”1552 And Paul in like manner: “For the wrath of God is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth
of God in unrighteousness.”1553</p>
<p>65. Moreover, concerning the resurrection and the kingdom of the saints, Daniel says,
“And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise, some to everlasting life,
(and some to shame and everlasting contempt).”1554 Esaias says, “The dead men shall arise,
and they that are in their tombs shall awake; for the dew from thee is healing to them.”1555
The Lord says, “Many in that day shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear
shall live.”1556 And the prophet says, “Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give thee light.”1557 And John says, “Blessed and holy is he that hath part
in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power.”1558 For the second death
is the lake of fire that burneth. And again the Lord says, “Then shall the righteous shine
forth as the sun shineth in his glory.”1559 And to the saints He will say, “Come, ye blessed

But what saith He to the wicked? “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels, which my Father hath prepared.” And John says, “Without are
dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever
maketh and loveth a lie; for your part is in the hell of fire.”1561 And in like manner also
Esaias: “And they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed
against me. And their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall
be for a spectacle to all flesh.”1562</p>
<p>66. Concerning the resurrection of the righteous, Paul also speaks thus in writing to the
Thessalonians: “We would not have you to be ignorant concerning them which are asleep,
that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and
rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say
unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive (and) remain unto the coming of
the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from
heaven with a shout, with the voice and trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
Then we which are alive (and) remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds
to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”1563</p>
<p>67. These things, then, I have set shortly before thee, O Theophilus, drawing them from
Scripture itself,1564 in order that, maintaining in faith what is written, and anticipating the
things that are to be, thou mayest keep thyself void of offence both toward God and toward

having raised the saints among us, He will rejoice with them, glorifying the Father. To Him

<head>Expository Treatise Against the Jews.</head>
<p>1. Now, then, incline thine ear to me, and hear my words, and give heed, thou Jew. Many
a time dost thou boast thyself, in that thou didst condemn Jesus of Nazareth to death, and
didst give Him vinegar and gall to drink; and thou dost vaunt thyself because of this. Come
therefore, and let us consider together whether perchance thou dost not boast unrighteously,
O Israel, (and) whether that small portion of vinegar and gall has not brought down this
fearful threatening upon thee, (and) whether this is not the cause of thy present condition
involved in these myriad troubles.</p>
<p>2. Let him then be introduced before us who speaketh by the Holy Spirit, and saith
truth—David the son of Jesse. He, singing a certain strain with prophetic reference to the
true Christ, celebrated our God by the Holy Spirit, (and) declared clearly all that befell Him
by the hands of the Jews in His passion; in which (strain) the Christ who humbled Himself
and took unto Himself the form of the servant Adam, calls upon God the Father in heaven
as it were in our person, and speaks thus in the sixty-ninth Psalm: “Save me, O God; for
the waters are come in unto my soul. I am sunk in the mire of the abyss,” that is to say, in
the corruption of Hades, on account of the transgression in paradise; and “there is no substance,”
that is, help. “My eyes failed while I hoped (or, from my hoping) upon my God;
when will He come and save me?”1566</p>
<p>3. Then, in what next follows, Christ speaks, as it were, in His own person: “Then I restored
that,” says He, “which I took not away;” that is, on account of the sin of Adam I endured
the death which was not mine by sinning. “For, O God, Thou knowest my foolishness;
and my sins are not hid from Thee,” that is, “for I did not sin,” as He means it; and for this
reason (it is added), “Let not them be ashamed who want to see” my resurrection on the
third day, to wit, the apostles. “Because for Thy sake,” that is, for the sake of obeying Thee,
“I have borne reproach,” namely the cross, when “they covered my face with shame,” that
is to say, the Jews; when “I became a stranger unto my brethren after the flesh, and an alien
unto my mother’s children,” meaning (by the mother) the synagogue. “For the zeal of Thine
house, Father, hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached Thee are fallen
on me,” and of them that sacrificed to idols. Wherefore “they that sit in the gate spoke against
me,” for they crucified me without the gate. “And they that drink sang against me,” that is,
(they who drink wine) at the feast of the passover. “But as for me, in my prayer unto Thee,
O Lord, I said, Father, forgive them,” namely the Gentiles, because it is the time for favour
with Gentiles. “Let not then the hurricane (of temptations) overwhelm me, neither let the
deep (that is, Hades) swallow me up: for Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell (Hades); neither
<note type="footnote">1566 Ps. lxix. 1 ff.</note>

<pb n="546"/>
let the pit shut her mouth upon me,”1567 that is, the sepulchre. “By reason of mine enemies,
deliver me,” that the Jews may not boast, saying, Let us consume him.</p>
<p>4. Now Christ prayed all this economically1568 as man; being, however, true God. But,
as I have already said, it was the “form of the servant”1569 that spake and suffered these
things. Wherefore He added, “My soul looked for reproach and trouble,” that is, I suffered
of my own will, (and) not by any compulsion. Yet “I waited for one to mourn with me, and
there was none,” for all my disciples forsook me and fled; and for a “comforter, and I found
none.”</p>
<p>5. Listen with understanding, O Jew, to what the Christ says: “They gave me gall for my
meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.” And these things He did indeed endure
from you. Hear the Holy Ghost tell you also what return He made to you for that little portion
of vinegar. For the prophet says, as in the person of God, “Let their table become a snare
and retribution.” Of what retribution does He speak? Manifestly, of the misery which has
now got hold of thee.</p>
<p>6. And then hear what follows: “Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not.” And
surely ye have been darkened in the eyes of your soul with a darkness utter and everlasting.
For now that the true light has arisen, ye wander as in the night, and stumble on places with
no roads, and fall headlong, as having forsaken the way that saith, “I am the way.”1570 Furthermore,
hear this yet more serious word: “And their back do thou bend always;” that
means, in order that they may be slaves to the nations, not four hundred and thirty years
as in Egypt, nor seventy as in Babylon, but bend them to servitude, he says, “always.” In
fine, then, how dost thou indulge vain hopes, expecting to be delivered from the misery
which holdeth thee? For that is somewhat strange. And not unjustly has he imprecated this
blindness of eyes upon thee. But because thou didst cover the eyes of Christ, (and1571) thus
thou didst beat Him, for this reason, too, bend thou thy back for servitude always. And
whereas thou didst pour out His blood in indignation, hear what thy recompense shall be:
“Pour out Thine indignation upon them, and let Thy wrathful anger take hold of them;”
and, “Let their habitation be desolate,” to wit, their celebrated temple.</p>
<p>7. But why, O prophet, tell us, and for what reason, was the temple made desolate? Was
it on account of that ancient fabrication of the calf? Was it on account of the idolatry of the
people? Was it for the blood of the prophets? Was it for the adultery and fornication of Israel?

By no means, he says; for in all these transgressions they always found pardon open to them,
and benignity; but it was because they killed the Son of their Benefactor, for He is coeternal
with the Father. Whence He saith, “Father, let their temple be made desolate;1572 for they
have persecuted Him whom Thou didst of Thine own will smite for the salvation of the
world;” that is, they have persecuted me with a violent and unjust death, “and they have
added to the pain of my wounds.” In former time, as the Lover of man, I had pain on account
of the straying of the Gentiles; but to this pain they have added another, by going also
themselves astray. Wherefore “add iniquity to their iniquity, and tribulation to tribulation,
and let them not enter into Thy righteousness,” that is, into Thy kingdom; but “let them be
blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous,” that is, with
their holy fathers and patriarchs.</p>
<p>8. What sayest thou to this, O Jew? It is neither Matthew nor Paul that saith these things,
but David, thine anointed, who awards and declares these terrible sentences on account of
Christ. And like the great Job, addressing you who speak against the righteous and true, he
says, “Thou didst barter the Christ like a slave, thou didst go to Him like a robber in the
garden.”</p>
<p>9. I produce now the prophecy of Solomon, which speaketh of Christ, and announces
clearly and perspicuously things concerning the Jews; and those which not only are befalling
them at the present time, but those, too, which shall befall them in the future age, on account
of the contumacy and audacity which they exhibited toward the Prince of Life; for the
prophet says, “The ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright,” that is, about
Christ, “Let us lie in wait for the righteous, because he is not for our turn, and he is clean
contrary to our doings and words, and upbraideth us with our offending the law, and professeth
to have knowledge of God; and he calleth himself the Child of God.”1573 And then
he says, “He is grievous to us even to behold; for his life is not like other men’s, and his ways
are of another fashion. We are esteemed of him as counterfeits, and he abstaineth from our
ways as from filthiness, and pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed.”1574 And again,
listen to this, O Jew! None of the righteous or prophets called himself the Son of God. And
therefore, as in the person of the Jews, Solomon speaks again of this righteous one, who is
Christ, thus: “He was made to reprove our thoughts, and he maketh his boast that God is
his Father. Let us see, then, if his words be true, and let us prove what shall happen in the
end of him; for if the just man be the Son of God, He will help him, and deliver him from

the hand of his enemies. Let us condemn him with a shameful death, for by his own saying
he shall be respected.”1575</p>
<p>10. And again David, in the Psalms, says with respect to the future age, “Then shall He”
(namely Christ) “speak unto them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure.”1576
And again Solomon says concerning Christ and the Jews, that “when the righteous shall
stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted Him, and made no account
of His words, when they see it they shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed
at the strangeness of His salvation; and they, repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit,
shall say within themselves, This is He whom we had sometimes in derision and a proverb
of reproach; we fools accounted His life madness, and His end to be without honour. How
is He numbered among the children of God, and His lot is among the saints? Therefore
have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto
us, and the sun of righteousness rose not on us. We wearied ourselves in the way of
wickedness and destruction; we have gone through deserts where there lay no way: but as
for the way of the Lord, we have not known it. What hath our pride profited us? all those
things are passed away like a shadow.”1577</p>

<p>1. And this is the passage regarding demons.1580 But now we must speak of Hades, in
which the souls both of the righteous and the unrighteous are detained. Hades is a place in
the created system, rude,1581 a locality beneath the earth, in which the light of the world
does not shine; and as the sun does not shine in this locality, there must necessarily be perpetual
darkness there. This locality has been destined to be as it were a guard-house for
souls, at which the angels are stationed as guards, distributing according to each one’s deeds
the temporary1582 punishments for (different) characters. And in this locality there is a
certain place1583 set apart by itself, a lake of unquenchable fire, into which we suppose no
one has ever yet been cast; for it is prepared against the day determined by God, in which
one sentence of righteous judgment shall be justly applied to all. And the unrighteous, and
those who believed not God, who have honoured as God the vain works of the hands of
men, idols fashioned (by themselves), shall be sentenced to this endless punishment. But
the righteous shall obtain the incorruptible and unfading kingdom, who indeed are at present
detained in Hades,1584 but not in the same place with the unrighteous. For to this locality
there is one descent, at the gate whereof we believe an archangel is stationed with a host.
And when those who are conducted by the angels1585 appointed unto the souls have passed
through this gate, they do not proceed on one and the same way; but the righteous, being
conducted in the light toward the right, and being hymned by the angels stationed at the

place, are brought to a locality full of light. And there the righteous from the beginning1586
dwell, not ruled by necessity, but enjoying always the contemplation of the blessings which
are in their view, and delighting themselves with the expectation of others ever new, and
deeming those ever better than these. And that place brings no toils to them. There, there
is neither fierce heat, nor cold, nor thorn;1587 but the face of the fathers and the righteous
is seen to be always smiling, as they wait for the rest and eternal revival in heaven which
succeed this location. And we call it by the name Abraham’s bosom. But the unrighteous
are dragged toward the left by angels who are ministers of punishment, and they go of their
own accord no longer, but are dragged by force as prisoners. And the angels appointed over
them send them along,1588 reproaching them and threatening them with an eye of terror,
forcing them down into the lower parts. And when they are brought there, those appointed
to that service drag them on to the confines or hell.1589 And those who are so near hear incessantly
the agitation, and feel the hot smoke. And when that vision is so near, as they see
the terrible and excessively glowing1590 spectacle of the fire, they shudder in horror at the
expectation of the future judgment, (as if they were) already feeling the power of their
punishment. And again, where they see the place of the fathers and the righteous,1591 they
are also punished there. For a deep and vast abyss is set there in the midst, so that neither
can any of the righteous in sympathy think to pass it, nor any of the unrighteous dare to
cross it.</p>

the time which God has determined; and then1592 He will accomplish a resurrection of all,
not by transferring souls into other bodies,1593 but by raising the bodies themselves. And
if, O Greeks, ye refuse credit to this because ye see these (bodies) in their dissolution, learn
not to be incredulous. For if ye believe that the soul is originated and is made immortal by
God, according to the opinion of Plato,1594 in time, ye ought not to refuse to believe that

God is able also to raise the body, which is composed of the same elements, and make it
immortal.1595 To be able in one thing, and to be unable in another, is a word which cannot
be said of God. We therefore believe that the body also is raised. For if it become corrupt,
it is not at least destroyed. For the earth receiving its remains preserves them, and they, becoming
as it were seed, and being wrapped up with the richer part of earth, spring up and
bloom. And that which is sown is sown indeed bare grain; but at the command of God the
Artificer it buds, and is raised arrayed and glorious, but not until it has first died, and been
dissolved, and mingled with earth. Not, therefore, without good reason do we believe in the
resurrection of the body. Moreover, if it is dissolved in its season on account of the
primeval transgression, and is committed to the earth as to a furnace, to be moulded again
anew, it is not raised the same thing as it is now, but pure and no longer corruptible. And
to every body its own proper soul will be given again; and the soul, being endued again with
it, shall not be grieved, but shall rejoice together with it, abiding itself pure with it also pure.
And as it now sojourns with it in the world righteously, and finds it in nothing now a traitor,
it will receive it again (the body) with great joy. But the unrighteous will receive their bodies
unchanged, and unransomed from suffering and disease, and unglorified, and still with all
the ills in which they died. And whatever manner of persons they (were when they) lived
without faith, as such they shall be faithfully judged.1596</p>
<p>3.1597 For all, the righteous and the unrighteous alike, shall be brought before God the
Word. For the Father hath committed all judgment to Him; and in fulfilment of the Father’s
counsel, He cometh as Judge whom we call Christ. For it is not Minos and Rhadamanthys
that are to judge (the world), as ye fancy, O Greeks, but He whom God the Father hath
glorified, of whom we have spoken elsewhere more in particular, for the profit of those who
seek the truth. He, in administering the righteous judgment of the Father to all, assigns to
each what is righteous according to his works. And being present at His judicial decision,
all, both men and angels and demons, shall utter one voice, saying, “Righteous is Thy judgment.”
1598 Of which voice the justification will be seen in the awarding to each that which
is just; since to those who have done well shall be assigned righteously eternal bliss, and to
the lovers of iniquity shall be given eternal punishment. And the fire which is unquenchable
and without end awaits these latter, and a certain fiery worm which dieth not, and which
does not waste the body, but continues bursting forth from the body with unending pain.

punishment; no voice of interceding friends will profit them.1599 For neither are the righteous
seen by them any longer, nor are they worthy of remembrance. But the righteous will remember
only the righteous deeds by which they reached the heavenly kingdom, in which
there is neither sleep, nor pain, nor corruption, nor care,1600 nor night, nor day measured
by time; nor sun traversing in necessary course the circle of heaven, which marks the limits
of seasons, or the points measured out for the life of man so easily read; nor moon waning
or waxing, or inducing the changes of seasons, or moistening the earth; no burning sun, no
changeful Bear, no Orion coming forth, no numerous wandering of stars, no painfullytrodden
earth, no abode of paradise hard to find; no furious roaring of the sea, forbidding
one to touch or traverse it; but this too will be readily passable for the righteous, although
it lacks no water. There will be no heaven inaccessible to men, nor will the way of its ascent
be one impossible to find; and there will be no earth unwrought, or toilsome for men, but
one producing fruit spontaneously in beauty and order; nor will there be generation of wild
beasts again, nor the bursting1601 substance of other creatures. Neither with man will there
be generation again, but the number of the righteous remains indefectible with the righteous
angels and spirits. Ye who believe these words, O men, will be partakers with the righteous,
and will have part in these future blessings, which “eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love
Him.”1602 To Him be the glory and the power, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Against the Heresy of One Noetus.1603</head>
<p>1. Some others are secretly introducing another doctrine, who have become disciples
of one Noetus, who was a native of Smyrna,1604 (and) lived not very long ago.1605 This
person was greatly puffed up and inflated with pride, being inspired by the conceit of a
strange spirit. He alleged that Christ was the Father Himself, and that the Father Himself
was born, and suffered, and died. Ye see what pride of heart and what a strange inflated
spirit had insinuated themselves into him. From his other actions, then, the proof is already
given us that he spoke not with a pure spirit; for he who blasphemes against the Holy Ghost
is cast out from the holy inheritance. He alleged that he was himself Moses, and that Aaron
was his brother.1606 When the blessed presbyters heard this, they summoned him before
the Church, and examined him. But he denied at first that he held such opinions. Afterwards,
however, taking shelter among some, and having gathered round him some others1607 who
had embraced the same error, he wished thereafter to uphold his dogma openly as correct.
And the blessed presbyters called him again before them, and examined him. But he stood
out against them, saying, “What evil, then, am I doing in glorifying Christ?” And the presbyters
replied to him, “We too know in truth one God;1608 we know Christ; we know that
the Son suffered even as He suffered, and died even as He died, and rose again on the third
day, and is at the right hand of the Father, and cometh to judge the living and the dead. And
these things which we have learned we allege.” Then, after examining him, they expelled
him from the Church. And he was carried to such a pitch of pride, that he established a
school.</p>
<note type="footnote">1603 Gallandi, p. 454.</note>
<note type="footnote">1604 That Noetus was a native of Smyrna is mentioned also by Theodoret, book iii. Hæret Fab., c. iii., and
Damascenus, sec. lvii. (who is accustomed to follow Epiphanius); and yet in Epiphanius, Hæres., 57, we read
that Noetus was an Asian of the city of Ephesus (᾽Ασιανον τῆς ᾽Εφέσου πόλεως). (Fabricius.)</note>
<note type="footnote">1605 Epiphanius says that Noetus made his heresy public about 130 years before his time (οὐ πρὸ ἐτῶν
πλειόνων ἀλλ᾽ ὡς πρὸ χρόνου τῶν τουτων ἑκατὸν τριάκοντα, πλείω ἢ ἐλάσσω); and as Epiphanius wrote in
the year 375, that would make the date of Noetus about 245. He says also that Noetus died soon after (ἔναγχος),
along with his brother. (Fabricius.)</note>
<note type="footnote">1606 So also Epiphanius and Damascenus. But Philastrius, Heresy, 53, puts Elijah for Aaron: hic etiam dicebat
se Moysem esse, et fratrem suum Eliam prophetam.</note>
<note type="footnote">1607 Epiphanius remarks that they were but ten in number.</note>
<note type="footnote">1608 The following words are the words of the Symbolum, as it is extant in Irenæus, i. 10, etc., and iii. 4; and

<p>2. Now they seek to exhibit the foundation for their dogma by citing the word in the
law, “I am the God of your fathers: ye shall have no other gods beside me;”1609 and again
in another passage, “I am the first,” He saith, “and the last; and beside me there is none
other.”1610 Thus they say they prove that God is one. And then they answer in this manner:
“If therefore I acknowledge Christ to be God, He is the Father Himself, if He is indeed God;
and Christ suffered, being Himself God; and consequently the Father suffered, for He was
the Father Himself.” But the case stands not thus; for the Scriptures do not set forth the
matter in this manner. But they make use also of other testimonies, and say, Thus it is
written: “This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of
Him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant
(son), and to Israel His beloved. Afterward did He show Himself upon earth, and conversed
with men.”1611 You see, then, he says, that this is God, who is the only One, and who afterwards
did show Himself, and conversed with men.” And in another place he says, “Egypt
hath laboured; and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come
over unto thee, (and they shall be slaves to thee); and they shall come after thee bound with
manacles, and they shall fall down unto thee, because God is in thee; and they shall make
supplication unto thee: and there is no God beside thee. For Thou art God, and we knew
not; God of Israel, the Saviour.”1612 Do you see, he says, how the Scriptures proclaim one
God? And as this is clearly exhibited, and these passages are testimonies to it, I am under
necessity, he says, since one is acknowledged, to make this One the subject of suffering. For
Christ was God, and suffered on account of us, being Himself the Father, that He might be
able also to save us. And we cannot express ourselves otherwise, he says; for the apostle also
acknowledges one God, when he says, “Whose are the fathers, (and) of whom as concerning
the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.”1613</p>
<p>3. In this way, then, they choose to set forth these things, and they make use only of one
class of passages;1614 just in the same one-sided manner that Theodotus employed when
<note type="footnote">1609 Ex. iii. 6 and xx. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">1610 Isa. xliv. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">1611 Baruch iii. 35–38. [Based on Prov. viii., but so remarkable that Grotius presumptuously declared it an

μονοκώλως and μονοτύπως, which are the terms employed by Epiphanius (p. 481). The meaning is, that the
Noetians, in explaining the words of Scripture concerning Christ, looked only to one side of the question—namely,
to the divine nature; just as Theodotus, on his part going to the opposite extreme, kept by the human nature
exclusively, and held that Christ was a mere man. Besides others, the presbyter Timotheus, in Cotelerii Monument.,</note>

<pb n="555"/>
he sought to prove that Christ was a mere man. But neither has the one party nor the other
understood the matter rightly, as the Scriptures themselves confute their senselessness, and
attest the truth. See, brethren, what a rash and audacious dogma they have introduced, when
they say without shame, the Father is Himself Christ, Himself the Son, Himself was born,
Himself suffered, Himself raised Himself. But it is not so. The Scriptures speak what is right;
but Noetus is of a different mind from them. Yet, though Noetus does not understand the
truth, the Scriptures are not at once to be repudiated. For who will not say that there is one
God? Yet he will not on that account deny the economy (i.e., the number and disposition
of persons in the Trinity). The proper way, therefore, to deal with the question is first of all
to refute the interpretation put upon these passages by these men, and then to explain their
real meaning. For it is right, in the first place, to expound the truth that the Father is one
God, “of whom is every family,”1615 “by whom are all things, of whom are all things, and
we in Him.”1616</p>
<p>4. Let us, as I said, see how he is confuted, and then let us set forth the truth. Now he
quotes the words, “Egypt has laboured, and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans,”
and so forth on to the words, “For Thou art the God of Israel, the Saviour.” And these words
he cites without understanding what precedes them. For whenever they wish to attempt
anything underhand, they mutilate the Scriptures. But let him quote the passage as a whole,
and he will discover the reason kept in view in writing it. For we have the beginning of the
section a little above; and we ought, of course, to commence there in showing to whom and
about whom the passage speaks. For above, the beginning of the section stands thus: “Ask
me concerning my sons and my daughters, and concerning the work of my hands command
ye me. I have made the earth, and man upon it: I with my hand have stablished the heaven;
I have commanded all the stars. I have raised him up, and all his ways are straight. He shall
build my city, and he shall turn back the captivity; not for price nor reward, said the Lord
of hosts. Thus said the Lord of hosts, Egypt hath laboured, and the merchandise of Ethiopia
and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be slaves to thee:
and they shall come after thee bound with manacles, and they shall fall down unto thee; and
they shall make supplication unto thee, because God is in thee; and there is no God beside
thee. For Thou art God, and we knew not; the God of Israel, the Saviour.”1617 “In thee,
<note type="footnote">vol. iii. p. 389, mentions Theodotus in these terms: “They say that this Theodotus was the leader and father of
the heresy of the Samosatan, having first alleged that Christ was a mere man.” [See vol. iii, p. 654, this series.]</note>

<pb n="556"/>
therefore,” says he, “God is.” But in whom is God except in Christ Jesus, the Father’s Word,
and the mystery of the economy?1618 And again, exhibiting the truth regarding Him, he
points to the fact of His being in the flesh when He says, “I have raised Him up in righteousness,
and all His ways are straight.” For what is this? Of whom does the Father thus testify?
It is of the Son that the Father says, “I have raised Him up in righteousness.” And that the
Father did raise up His Son in righteousness, the Apostle Paul bears witness, saying, “But
if the Spirit of Him that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised
up Christ Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that
dwelleth in you.”1619 Behold, the word spoken by the prophet is thus made good, “I have
raised Him up in righteousness.” And in saying, “God is in thee,” he referred to the mystery
of the economy, because when the Word was made incarnate and became man, the Father
was in the Son, and the Son in the Father, while the Son was living among men. This,
therefore, was signified, brethren, that in reality the mystery of the economy by the Holy
Ghost and the Virgin was this Word, constituting yet one Son to God.1620 And it is not
simply that I say this, but He Himself attests it who came down from heaven; for He
speaketh thus: “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven,
even the Son of man which is in heaven.”1621 What then can he seek beside what is thus
written? Will he say, forsooth, that flesh was in heaven? Yet there is the flesh which was
presented by the Father’s Word as an offering,—the flesh that came by the Spirit and the
Virgin, (and was) demonstrated to be the perfect Son of God. It is evident, therefore, that
He offered Himself to the Father. And before this there was no flesh in heaven. Who, then,
was in heaven1622 but the Word unincarnate, who was despatched to show that He was
upon earth and was also in heaven? For He was Word, He was Spirit, He was Power. The
same took to Himself the name common and current among men, and was called from the
beginning the Son of man on account of what He was to be, although He was not yet man,
as Daniel testifies when he says, “I saw, and behold one like the Son of man came on the
clouds of heaven.”1623 Rightly, then, did he say that He who was in heaven was called from
the beginning by this name, the Word of God, as being that from the beginning.</p>

<note type="footnote">1620 Turrian has the following note: “The Word of God constituted (operatum est) one Son to God; i.e., the

<p>5. But what is meant, says he, in the other passage: “This is God, and there shall none
other be accounted of in comparison of Him?”1624 That said he rightly. For in comparison
of the Father who shall be accounted of? But he says: “This is our God; there shall none
other be accounted of in comparison of Him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge,
and hath given it unto Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved.” He saith well. For who
is Jacob His servant, Israel His beloved, but He of whom He crieth, saying, “This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye Him?”1625 Having received, then, all knowledge
from the Father, the perfect Israel, the true Jacob, afterward did show Himself upon
earth, and conversed with men. And who, again, is meant by Israel1626 but a man who sees
God? and there is no one who sees God except the Son alone, the perfect man who alone
declares the will of the Father. For John also says, “No man hath seen God at any time; the
only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared1627 Him.”1628
And again: “He who came down from heaven testifieth what He hath heard and seen.”1629
This, then, is He to whom the Father hath given all knowledge, who did show Himself upon
earth, and conversed with men.</p>
<p>6. Let us look next at the apostle’s word: “Whose are the fathers, of whom as concerning
the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.”1630 This word declares the
mystery of the truth rightly and clearly. He who is over all is God; for thus He speaks boldly,
“All things are delivered unto me of my Father.”1631 He who is over all, God blessed, has
been born; and having been made man, He is (yet) God for ever. For to this effect John also
has said, “Which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.”1632 And well has
he named Christ the Almighty. For in this he has said only what Christ testifies of Himself.

For Christ gave this testimony, and said, “All things are delivered unto me of my Father;”1633
and Christ rules all things, and has been appointed1634 Almighty by the Father. And in like
manner Paul also, in setting forth the truth that all things are delivered unto Him, said,
“Christ the first-fruits; afterwards they that are Christ’s at His coming. Then cometh the
end, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when He shall
have put down all rule, and all authority, and power. For He must reign, till He hath put all
enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For all things are
put under Him. But when He saith, All things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is
excepted which did put all things under Him. Then shall He also Himself be subject to Him
who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.”1635 If, therefore, all things are
put under Him with the exception of Him who put them under Him, He is Lord of all, and
the Father is Lord of Him, that in all there might be manifested one God, to whom all things
are made subject together with Christ, to whom the Father hath made all things subject,
with the exception of Himself. And this, indeed, is said by Christ Himself, as when in the
Gospel He confessed Him to be His Father and His God. For He speaks thus: “I go to my
Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.”1636 If then, Noetus ventures to say
that He is the Father Himself, to what father will he say Christ goes away according to the
word of the Gospel? But if he will have us abandon the Gospel and give credence to his
senselessness, he expends his labour in vain; for “we ought to obey God rather than men.”1637</p>
<p>7. If, again, he allege His own word when He said, “I and the Father are one,”1638 let
him attend to the fact, and understand that He did not say, “I and the Father am one, but
are one.”1639 For the word are1640is not said of one person, but it refers to two persons, and
one power.1641 He has Himself made this clear, when He spake to His Father concerning
the disciples, “The glory which Thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one,
even as we are one: I in them, and Thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; that
the world may know that Thou hast sent me.”1642 What have the Noetians to say to these
things? Are all one body in respect of substance, or is it that we become one in the power

and disposition of unity of mind?1643 In the same manner the Son, who was sent and was
not known of those who are in the world, confessed that He was in the Father in power and
disposition. For the Son is the one mind of the Father. We who have the Father’s mind believe
so (in Him); but they who have it not have denied the Son. And if, again, they choose to allege
the fact that Philip inquired about the Father, saying, “Show us the Father, and it sufficeth
us,” to whom the Lord made answer in these terms: “Have I been so long time with you,
and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. Believest
thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?”1644 and if they choose to maintain
that their dogma is ratified by this passage, as if He owned Himself to be the Father, let them
know that it is decidedly against them, and that they are confuted by this very word. For
though Christ had spoken of Himself, and showed Himself among all as the Son, they had
not yet recognised Him to be such, neither had they been able to apprehend or contemplate
His real power. And Philip, not having been able to receive this, as far as it was possible to
see it, requested to behold the Father. To whom then the Lord said, “Philip, have I been so
long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me? He that hath seen me hath seen the
Father.” By which He means, If thou hast seen me, thou mayest know the Father through
me. For through the image, which is like (the original), the Father is made readily known.
But if thou hast not known the image, which is the Son, how dost thou seek to see the
Father? And that this is the case is made clear by the rest of the chapter, which signifies that
the Son who “has been set forth1645 was sent from the Father,1646 and goeth to the Father.”
1647</p>
<p>8. Many other passages, or rather all of them, attest the truth. A man, therefore, even
though he will it not, is compelled to acknowledge God the Father Almighty, and Christ
Jesus the Son of God, who, being God, became man, to whom also the Father made all things
subject, Himself excepted, and the Holy Spirit; and that these, therefore, are three. But if he
desires to learn how it is shown still that there is one God, let him know that His power1648
is one. As far as regards the power, therefore, God is one. But as far as regards the economy
there is a threefold manifestation, as shall be proved afterwards when we give account of
the true doctrine. In these things, however, which are thus set forth by us, we are at one.
For there is one God in whom we must believe, but unoriginated, impassible, immortal,

doing all things as He wills, in the way He wills, and when He wills. What, then, will this
Noetus, who knows1649 nothing of the truth, dare to say to these things? And now, as Noetus
has been confuted, let us turn to the exhibition of the truth itself, that we may establish the
truth, against which all these mighty heresies1650 have arisen without being able to state
anything to the purpose.</p>
<p>9. There is, brethren, one God, the knowledge of whom we gain from the Holy Scriptures,
and from no other source. For just as a man, if he wishes to be skilled in the wisdom of this
world, will find himself unable to get at it in any other way than by mastering the dogmas
of philosophers, so all of us who wish to practise piety will be unable to learn its practice
from any other quarter than the oracles of God.1651 Whatever things, then, the Holy Scriptures
declare, at these let us look; and whatsoever things they teach, these let us learn; and
as the Father wills our belief to be, let us believe; and as He wills the Son to be glorified, let
us glorify Him; and as He wills the Holy Spirit to be bestowed, let us receive Him. Not according
to our own will, nor according to our own mind, nor yet as using violently those
things which are given by God, but even as He has chosen to teach them by the Holy
Scriptures, so let us discern them.</p>
<p>10. God, subsisting alone, and having nothing contemporaneous with Himself, determined
to create the world. And conceiving the world in mind, and willing and uttering the
word, He made it; and straightway it appeared, formed as it had pleased Him. For us, then,
it is sufficient simply to know that there was nothing contemporaneous with God. Beside
Him there was nothing; but1652 He, while existing alone, yet existed in plurality.1653 For
He was neither without reason, nor wisdom, nor power, nor counsel.1654 And all things
were in Him, and He was the All. When He willed, and as He willed,1655 He manifested His
word in the times determined by Him, and by Him He made all things. When He wills, He
does; and when He thinks, He executes; and when He speaks, He manifests; when He fashions,
He contrives in wisdom. For all things that are made He forms by reason and wisdom—
creating them in reason, and arranging them in wisdom. He made them, then, as He
pleased, for He was God. And as the Author, and fellow-Counsellor, and Framer1656 of the

things that are in formation, He begat1657 the Word; and as He bears this Word in Himself,
and that, too, as (yet) invisible to the world which is created, He makes Him visible; (and)
uttering the voice first, and begetting Him as Light of Light,1658 He set Him forth to the
world as its Lord, (and) His own mind;1659 and whereas He was visible formerly to Himself
alone, and invisible to the world which is made, He makes Him visible in order that the
world might see Him in His manifestation, and be capable of being saved.</p>
<p>11. And thus there appeared another beside Himself. But when I say another,1660 I do
not mean that there are two Gods, but that it is only as light of light, or as water from a
fountain, or as a ray from the sun. For there is but one power, which is from the All;1661
and the Father is the All, from whom cometh this Power, the Word. And this is the mind1662
which came forth into the world, and was manifested as the Son1663 of God. All things,
then, are by Him, and He alone is of the Father. Who then adduces a multitude of gods
brought in, time after time? For all are shut up, however unwillingly, to admit this fact, that
the All runs up into one. If, then, all things run up into one, even according to Valentinus,
and Marcion, and Cerinthus, and all their fooleries, they are also reduced, however unwillingly,
to this position, that they must acknowledge that the One is the cause of all things.
Thus, then, these too, though they wish it not, fall in with the truth, and admit that one God
made all things according to His good pleasure. And He gave the law and the prophets; and
in giving them, He made them speak by the Holy Ghost, in order that, being gifted with the
inspiration of the Father’s power, they might declare the Father’s counsel and will.</p>
<note type="footnote">1657 The “begetting” of which Hippolytus speaks here is not the generation, properly so called, but that
manifestation and bringing forth of the Word co-existing from eternity with the Father, which referred to the
creation of the world. So at least Bull and Bossuet, as cited above; also Maranus, De Divinit. J. C., lib. iv. cap.

<p>12. Acting then in these (prophets), the Word spoke of Himself. For already He became
His own herald, and showed that the Word would be manifested among men. And for this
reason He cried thus: “I am made manifest to them that sought me not; I am found of them
that asked not for me.”1664 And who is He that is made manifest but the Word of the
Father?—whom the Father sent, and in whom He showed to men the power proceeding
from Him. Thus, then, was the Word made manifest, even as the blessed John says. For he
sums up the things that were said by the prophets, and shows that this is the Word, by whom
all things were made. For he speaks to this effect: “In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and without
Him was not anything made.”1665 And beneath He says, “The world was made by Him, and
the world knew Him not; He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.”1666 If,
then, said he, the world was made by Him, according to the word of the prophet, “By the
Word of the Lord were the heavens made,”1667 then this is the Word that was also made
manifest. We accordingly see the Word incarnate, and we know the Father by Him, and we
believe in the Son, (and) we worship the Holy Spirit. Let us then look at the testimony of
Scripture, with respect to the announcement of the future manifestation of the Word.</p>
<p>13. Now Jeremiah says, “Who hath stood in the counsel1668 of the Lord, and hath perceived
His Word?”1669 But the Word of God alone is visible, while the word of man is
audible. When he speaks of seeing the Word, I must believe that this visible (Word) has
been sent. And there was none other (sent) but the Word. And that He was sent Peter testifies,
when he says to the centurion Cornelius: “God sent His Word unto the children of Israel
by the preaching of Jesus Christ. This is the God who is Lord of all.”1670 If, then, the Word
is sent by Jesus Christ, the will1671 of the Father is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>14. These things then, brethren, are declared by the Scriptures. And the blessed John,
in the testimony of his Gospel, gives us an account of this economy (disposition) and acknowledges
this Word as God, when he says, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God.” If, then, the Word was with God, and was also God,
what follows? Would one say that he speaks of two Gods?1672 I shall not indeed speak of
two Gods, but of one; of two Persons however, and of a third economy (disposition), viz.,
the grace of the Holy Ghost. For the Father indeed is One, but there are two Persons, because
there is also the Son; and then there is the third, the Holy Spirit. The Father decrees, the
Word executes, and the Son is manifested, through whom the Father is believed on. The
economy1673 of harmony is led back to one God; for God is One. It is the Father who commands,
1674 and the Son who obeys, and the Holy Spirit who gives understanding:1675 the
Father who is above all,1676 and the Son who is through all, and the Holy Spirit who is in
all. And we cannot otherwise think of one God,1677 but by believing in truth in Father and
Son and Holy Spirit. For the Jews glorified (or gloried in) the Father, but gave Him not
thanks, for they did not recognise the Son. The disciples recognised the Son, but not in the
Holy Ghost; wherefore they also denied Him.1678 The Father’s Word, therefore, knowing
the economy (disposition) and the will of the Father, to wit, that the Father seeks to be
<note type="footnote">1672 From this passage it is clear that Hippolytus taught the doctrine of one God alone and three Persons. A
little before, in the eighth chapter, he said that there is one God, according to substance or divine essence, which
one substance is in three Persons; and that, according to disposition or economy, there are three Persons
manifested. By the term economy, therefore, he understands, with Tertullian, adversus Praxeam. ch. iii., the
number and disposition of the Trinity (numerum et dispositionem Trinitatis). Here he also calls the grace of the
Holy Spirit the third economy, but in the same way as Tertullian, who calls the Holy Spirit the third grade (tertium
gradum). For the terms gradus, forma, species, dispositio, andoeconimia mean the same in Tertullian. (Maranus.)

the keenest opponents of the Arian heresy—Athanasius, Basil, Marius Victorinus, Hilary, Prosper, and others.

worshipped in none other way than this, gave this charge to the disciples after He rose from
the dead: “Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”1679 And by this He showed, that whosoever omitted any one
of these, failed in glorifying God perfectly. For it is through this Trinity1680 that the Father
is glorified. For the Father willed, the Son did, the Spirit manifested. The whole Scriptures,
then, proclaim this truth.</p>
<p>15. But some one will say to me, You adduce a thing strange to me, when you call the
Son the Word. For John indeed speaks of the Word, but it is by a figure of speech. Nay, it
is by no figure of speech.1681 For while thus presenting this Word that was from the beginning,
and has now been sent forth, he said below in the Apocalypse, “And I saw heaven opened,
and behold a white horse; and He that sat upon him (was) Faithful and True; and in righteousness
He doth judge and make war. And His eyes (were) as flame of fire, and on His
head were many crowns; and He had a name written that no man knew but He Himself.
And He (was) clothed in a vesture dipped in blood: and His name is called the Word of
God.”1682 See then, brethren, how the vesture sprinkled with blood denoted in symbol the
flesh, through which the impassible Word of God came under suffering, as also the prophets
testify to me. For thus speaks the blessed Micah: “The house of Jacob provoked the Spirit
of the Lord to anger. These are their pursuits. Are not His words good with them, and do
they walk rightly? And they have risen up in enmity against His countenance of peace, and
they have stripped off His glory.”1683 That means His suffering in the flesh. And in like
manner also the blessed Paul says, “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak, God,
sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, condemned sin in the flesh, that the
righteousness of the law might be shown in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit.”1684 What Son of His own, then, did God send through the flesh but the Word,1685
whom He addressed as Son because He was to become such (or be begotten) in the future?
And He takes the common name for tender affection among men in being called the Son.
For neither was the Word, prior to incarnation and when by Himself,1686 yet perfect Son,

although He was perfect Word, only-begotten. Nor could the flesh subsist by itself apart
from the Word, because it has its subsistence1687 in the Word.1688 Thus, then, one perfect
Son of God was manifested.</p>
<p>16. And these indeed are testimonies bearing on the incarnation of the Word; and there
are also very many others. But let us also look at the subject in hand,—namely, the question,
brethren, that in reality the Father’s power, which is the Word, came down from heaven,
and not the Father Himself. For thus He speaks: “I came forth from the Father, and am
come.”1689 Now what subject is meant in this sentence, “I came forth from the Father,”1690
but just the Word? And what is it that is begotten of Him, but just the Spirit,1691 that is to
say, the Word? But you will say to me, How is He begotten? In your own case you can give
no explanation of the way in which you were begotten, although you see every day the cause
according to man; neither can you tell with accuracy the economy in His case.1692 For you
have it not in your power to acquaint yourself with the practised and indescribable art1693
(method) of the Maker, but only to see, and understand, and believe that man is God’s work.
Moreover, you are asking an account of the generation of the Word, whom God the Father
in His good pleasure begat as He willed. Is it not enough for you to learn that God made
the world, but do you also venture to ask whence He made it? Is it not enough for you to
learn that the Son of God has been manifested to you for salvation if you believe, but do you
also inquire curiously how He was begotten after the Spirit? No more than two,1694 in sooth,
have been put in trust to give the account of His generation after the flesh; and are you then

so bold as to seek the account (of His generation) after the Spirit, which the Father keeps
with Himself, intending to reveal it then to the holy ones and those worthy of seeing His
face? Rest satisfied with the word spoken by Christ, viz., “That which is born of the Spirit
is spirit,”1695 just as, speaking by the prophet of the generation of the Word, He shows the
fact that He is begotten, but reserves the question of the manner and means, to reveal it only
in the time determined by Himself. For He speaks thus: “From the womb, before the
morning star, I have begotten Thee.”1696</p>
<p>17. These testimonies are sufficient for the believing who study truth, and the unbelieving
credit no testimony.1697 For the Holy Spirit, indeed, in the person of the apostles, has testified
to this, saying, “And who has believed our report?”1698 Therefore let us not prove ourselves
unbelieving, lest the word spoken be fulfilled in us. Let us believe then, dear1699 brethren,
according to the tradition of the apostles, that God the Word came down from heaven, (and
entered) into the holy Virgin Mary, in order that, taking the flesh from her, and assuming
also a human, by which I mean a rational soul, and becoming thus all that man is with the
exception of sin, He might save fallen man, and confer immortality on men who believe on
His name. In all, therefore, the word of truth is demonstrated to us, to wit, that the Father
is One, whose word is present (with Him), by whom He made all things; whom also, as we
have said above, the Father sent forth in later times for the salvation of men. This (Word)
was preached by the law and the prophets as destined to come into the world. And even as
He was preached then, in the same manner also did He come and manifest Himself, being
by the Virgin and the Holy Spirit made a new man; for in that He had the heavenly (nature)
of the Father, as the Word and the earthly (nature), as taking to Himself the flesh from the
old Adam by the medium of the Virgin, He now, coming forth into the world, was manifested
as God in a body, coming forth too as a perfect man. For it was not in mere appearance or
by conversion,1700 but in truth, that He became man.</p>

proper to Him as man,1702 since He hungers and toils and thirsts in weariness, and flees in
fear, and prays in trouble. And He who as God has a sleepless nature, slumbers on a pillow.
And He who for this end came into the world, begs off from the cup of suffering. And in
an agony He sweats blood, and is strengthened by an angel, who Himself strengthens those
who believe on Him, and taught men to despise death by His work.1703 And He who knew
what manner of man Judas was, is betrayed by Judas. And He, who formerly was honoured
by him as God, is contemned by Caiaphas.1704 And He is set at nought by Herod, who is
Himself to judge the whole earth. And He is scourged by Pilate, who took upon Himself
our infirmities. And by the soldiers He is mocked, at whose behest stand thousands of
thousands and myriads of myriads of angels and archangels. And He who fixed the heavens
like a vault is fastened to the cross by the Jews. And He who is inseparable from the Father
cries to the Father, and commends to Him His spirit; and bowing His head, He gives up the
ghost, who said, “I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again;”1705
and because He was not overmastered by death, as being Himself Life, He said this: “I lay
it down of myself.”1706 And He who gives life bountifully to all, has His side pierced with
a spear. And He who raises the dead is wrapped in linen and laid in a sepulchre, and on the
third day He is raised again by the Father, though Himself the Resurrection and the Life.

“Himself hath borne our infirmities, and carried our diseases; and for our sakes He was afflicted,”
1707 as Isaiah the prophet has said. This is He who was hymned by the angels, and
seen by the shepherds, and waited for by Simeon, and witnessed to by Anna. This is He who

<p>By the omnipotent will of God all things are made, and the things that are made are
also preserved, being maintained according to their several principles in perfect harmony
by Him who is in His nature the omnipotent God and maker of all things,1714 His divine

severally are by their own natural laws.1715 For the infinite cannot in any manner or by any
account be susceptible of movement, inasmuch as it has nothing towards which and nothing
around which it shall be moved. For in the case of that which is in its nature infinite, and
so incapable of being moved, movement would be conversion.1716 Wherefore also the Word
of God being made truly man in our manner, yet without sin, and acting and enduring in
man’s way such sinless things as are proper to our nature, and assuming the circumscription
of the flesh of our nature on our behalf, sustained no conversion in that aspect in which He
is one with the Father, being made in no respect one with the flesh through the exinanition.
1717 But as He was without flesh,1718 He remained without any circumscription. And

through the flesh He wrought divinely1719 those things which are proper to divinity,
showing Himself to have both those natures in both of which He wrought, I mean the divine
and the human, according to that veritable and real and natural subsistence,1720 (showing
Himself thus) as both being in reality and as being understood to be at one and the same
time infinite God and finite man, having the nature1721 of each in perfection, with the same
activity,1722 that is to say, the same natural properties;1723 whence we know that their distinction
abides always according to the nature of each, and without conversion. But it is not
(i.e., the distinction between deity and humanity), as some say, a merely comparative (or
relative) matter,1724 that we may not speak in an unwarrantable manner of a greater and a
less in one who is ever the same in Himself.1725 For comparisons can be instituted only
between objects of like nature, and not between objects of unlike nature. But between God
the Maker of all things and that which is made, between the infinite and the finite, between
infinitude and finitude, there can be no kind of comparison, since these differ from each
other not in mere comparison (or relatively), but absolutely in essence. And yet at the same
time there has been effected a certain inexpressible and irrefragable union of the two into
one substance,1726 which entirely passes the understanding of anything that is made. For
the divine is just the same after the incarnation that it was before the incarnation; in its essence
infinite, illimitable, impassible, incomparable, unchangeable, inconvertable, self-potent,
1727 and, in short, subsisting in essence alone the infinitely worthy good.</p>

<p>The God of all things therefore became truly, according to the Scriptures, without conversion,
sinless man, and that in a manner known to Himself alone, as He is the natural
Artificer of things which are above our comprehension. And by that same saving act of the
incarnation1728 He introduced into the flesh the activity of His proper divinity, yet without
having it (that activity) either circumscribed by the flesh through the exinanition, or growing
naturally out of the flesh as it grew out of His divinity,1729 but manifested through it in the
things which He wrought in a divine manner in His incarnate state. For the flesh did not
become divinity in nature by a transmutation of nature, as though it became essentially flesh
of divinity. But what it was before, that also it continued to be in nature and activity when
united with divinity, even as the Saviour said, “The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.”1730 And working and enduring in the flesh things which were proper to sinless flesh,
He proved the evacuation of divinity (to be) for our sakes, confirmed as it was by wonders
and by sufferings of the flesh naturally. For with this purpose did the God of all things become
man, viz., in order that by suffering in the flesh, which is susceptible of suffering, He might
redeem our whole race, which was sold to death; and that by working wondrous things by
His divinity, which is unsusceptible of suffering, through the medium of the flesh He might
restore it to that incorruptible and blessed life from which it fell away by yielding to the
devil; and that He might establish the holy orders of intelligent existences in the heavens in
immutability by the mystery of His incarnation,1731 the doing of which is the recapitulation
of all things in himself.1732 He remained therefore, also, after His incarnation, according
to nature, God infinite, and more,1733 having the activity proper and suitable to Himself,—an
activity growing out of His divinity essentially, and manifested through His perfectly holy
flesh by wondrous acts economically, to the intent that He might be believed in as God,
while working out of Himself1734 by the flesh, which by nature is weak, the salvation of the
universe.</p>

<p>Fragment III.</p>
<p>Now, with the view of explaining, by means of an illustration, what has been said concerning
the Saviour, (I may say that) the power of thought1735 which I have by nature is
proper and suitable to me, as being possessed of a rational and intelligent soul; and to this
soul there pertains, according to nature, a self-moved energy and first power, ever-moving,
to wit, the thought that streams from it naturally. This thought I utter, when there is occasion,
by fitting it to words, and expressing it rightly in signs, using the tongue as an organ, or artificial
characters, showing that it is heard, though it comes into actuality by means of objects
foreign to itself, and yet is not changed itself by those foreign objects.1736 For my natural
thought does not belong to the tongue or the letters, although I effect its utterance by means
of these; but it belongs to me, who speak according to my nature, and by means of both
these express it as my own, streaming as it does always from my intelligent soul according
to its nature, and uttered by means of my bodily tongue organically, as I have said, when
there is occasion. Now, to institute a comparison with that which is utterly beyond comparison,
just as in us the power of thought that belongs by nature to the soul is brought to utterance
by means of our bodily tongue without any change in itself, so, too, in the wondrous
incarnation1737 of God is the omnipotent and all-creating energy of the entire deity1738
manifested without mutation in itself, by means of His perfectly holy flesh, and in the works
which He wrought after a divine manner, (that energy of the deity) remaining in its essence
free from all circumscription, although it shone through the flesh, which is itself essentially
limited. For that which is in its nature unoriginated cannot be circumscribed by an originated
nature, although this latter may have grown into one with it1739 by a conception which
circumscribes all understanding:1740 nor can this be ever brought into the same nature and
natural activity with that, so long as they remain each within its own proper and inconvertible
nature.1741 For it is only in objects of the same nature that there is the motion that works

<p>For, in the view of apostles and prophets and teachers, the mystery of the divine incarnation
has been distinguished as having two points of contemplation natural to it,1744 distinct
in all things, inasmuch as on the one hand it is the subsistence of perfect deity, and on the
other is demonstrative of full humanity. As long, therefore,1745 as the Word is acknowledged
to be in substance one, of one energy, there shall never in any way be known a movement1746
in the two. For while God, who is essentially ever-existent, became by His infinite power,
according to His will, sinless man, He is what He was, in all wherein God is known; and
what He became, He is in all wherein man is known and can be recognised. In both aspects
of Himself He never falls out of Himself,1747 in His divine activities and in His human alike,
preserving in both relations His own essentially unchangeable perfection.</p>

<p>For lately a certain person, Beron, along with some others, forsook the delusion of
Valentinus, only to involve themselves in deeper error, affirming that the flesh assumed to
Himself by the Word became capable of working like works with the deity1748 by virtue of
its assumption, and that the deity became susceptible of suffering in the same way with the
flesh1749 by virtue of the exinanition;1750 and thus they assert the doctrine that there was
at the same time a conversion and a mixing and a fusing1751 of the two aspects one with the
other. For if the flesh that was assumed became capable of working like works with the deity,
it is evident that it also became God in essence in all wherein God is essentially known. And
if the deity by the exinanition became susceptible of the same sufferings with the flesh, it is
evident that it also became in essence flesh in all wherein flesh essentially can be known.
For objects that act in like manner,1752 and work like works, and are altogether of like kind,
and are susceptible of like suffering with each other, admit of no difference of nature; and
if the natures are fused together,1753 Christ will be a duality;1754 and if the persons1755 are
separated, there will be a quaternity,1756—a thing which is altogether to be avoided. And
how will they conceive of the one and the same Christ, who is at once God and man by
nature? And what manner of existence will He have according to them, if He has become
man by a conversion of the deity, and if he has become God by a change of the flesh? For
the mutation1757 of these, the one into the other, is a complete subversion of both. Let the
discussion, then, be considered by us again in a different way.</p>

<p>Among Christians it is settled as the doctrine of piety, that, according to nature itself,
and to the activity and to whatever else pertains thereunto, God is equal and the same with
Himself,1758 having nothing that is His unequal to Himself at all and heterogeneous.1759
If, then, according to Beron, the flesh that He assumed to Himself became possessed of the
like natural energy with them, it is evident that it also became possessed of the like nature
with Him in all wherein that nature consists,—to wit, non-origination, non-generation, infinitude,
eternity, incomprehensibility, and whatever else in the way of the transcendent the
theological mind discerns in deity; and thus they both underwent conversion, neither the
one nor the other preserving any more the substantial relation of its own proper nature.1760
For he who recognises an identical operation1761 in things of unlike nature, introduces at
the same time a fusion of natures and a separation of persons,1762 their natural existence1763
being made entirely undistinguishable by the transference of properties.1764</p>

<p>But if it (the flesh) did not become of like nature with that (the deity), neither shall it

<p>Into this error, then, have they been carried, by believing, unhappily, that that divine
energy was made the property of the flesh which was only manifested through the flesh in
His miraculous actions; by which energy Christ, in so far as He is apprehended as God, gave
existence to the universe, and now maintains and governs it. For they did not perceive that
it is impossible for the energy of the divine nature to become the property1766 of a being of
a different nature1767 apart from conversion; nor did they understand that that is not by
any means the property of the flesh which is only manifested through it, and does not spring
out of it according to nature; and yet the proof thereof was clear and evident to them. For
I, by speaking with the tongue and writing with the hand, reveal through both these one
and the same thought of my intelligent soul, its energy (or operation) being natural; in no
way showing it as springing naturally out of tongue or hand; nor yet (showing) even the
spoken thought as made to belong to them in virtue of its revelation by their means. For no
intelligent person ever recognised tongue or hand as capable of thought, just as also no one
ever recognised the perfectly holy flesh of God, in virtue of its assumption, and in virtue of
the revelation of the divine energy through its medium, as becoming in nature creative.1768
But the pious confession of the believer is that, with a view to our salvation, and in order to
connect the universe with unchangeableness, the Creator of all things incorporated with
Himself1769 a rational soul and a sensible1770 body from the all-holy Mary, ever-virgin, by
an undefiled conception, without conversion, and was made man in nature, but separate
from wickedness: the same was perfect God, and the same was perfect man; the same was
in nature at once perfect God and man. In His deity He wrought divine things through His
all-holy flesh,—such things, namely, as did not pertain to the flesh by nature; and in His
humanity He suffered human things,—such things, namely, as did not pertain to deity by
nature, by the upbearing of the deity.1771 He wrought nothing divine without the body;1772
nor did the same do anything human without the participation of deity.1773 Thus He preserved
for Himself a new and fitting method1774 by which He wrought (according to the

together in nature the deity and the humanity of Christ in a single energy,1779 and again
separating them in person, subverts the life, not knowing that identical operation1780 is indicative
of the connatural identity only of connatural persons.1781</p>

<head>The Discourse on the Holy Theophany.</head>
<p>1. Good, yea, very good, are all the works of our God and Saviour—all of them that eye
seeth and mind perceiveth, all that reason interprets and hand handles, all that intellect
comprehends and human nature understands. For what richer beauty can there be than
that of the circle1782 of heaven? And what form of more blooming fairness than that of
earth’s surface? And what is there swifter in the course than the chariot of the sun? And
what more graceful car than the lunar orb?1783 And what work more wonderful than the
compact mosaic of the stars?1784 And what more productive of supplies than the seasonable
winds? And what more spotless mirror than the light of day? And what creature more excellent
than man? Very good, then, are all the works of our God and Saviour. And what more
requisite gift, again, is there than the element1785 of water? For with water all things are
washed and nourished, and cleansed and bedewed. Water bears the earth, water produces
the dew, water exhilarates the vine; water matures the corn in the ear, water ripens the
grapecluster, water softens the olive, water sweetens the palm-date, water reddens the rose
and decks the violet, water makes the lily bloom with its brilliant cups. And why should I
speak at length? Without the element of water, none of the present order of things can
subsist. So necessary is the element of water; for the other elements1786 took their places
beneath the highest vault of the heavens, but the nature of water obtained a seat also above
the heavens. And to this the prophet himself is a witness, when he exclaims, “Praise the
Lord, ye heavens of heavens, and the water that is above the heavens.”1787</p>
<p>2. Nor is this the only thing that proves the dignity1788 of the water. But there is also
that which is more honourable than all—the fact that Christ, the Maker of all, came down
as the rain,1789 and was known as a spring,1790 and diffused Himself as a river,1791 and was
baptized in the Jordan.1792 For you have just heard how Jesus came to John, and was baptized
by him in the Jordan. Oh things strange beyond compare! How should the boundless

River1793 that makes glad the city of God have been dipped in a little water! The illimitable
Spring that bears life to all men, and has no end, was covered by poor and temporary waters!
He who is present everywhere, and absent nowhere—who is incomprehensible to angels
and invisible to men—comes to the baptism according to His own good pleasure. When
you hear these things, beloved, take them not as if spoken literally, but accept them as
presented in a figure.1794 Whence also the Lord was not unnoticed by the watery element
in what He did in secret, in the kindness of His condescension to man. “For the waters saw
Him, and were afraid.”1795 They well-nigh broke from their place, and burst away from
their boundary. Hence the prophet, having this in his view many generations ago, puts the
question, “What aileth thee, O sea, that thou fleddest; and thou, Jordan, that thou wast
driven back?”1796 And they in reply said, We have seen the Creator of all things in the “form
of a servant,”1797 and being ignorant of the mystery of the economy, we were lashed with
fear.</p>
<p>3. But we, who know the economy, adore His mercy, because He hath come to save and
not to judge the world. Wherefore John, the forerunner of the Lord, who before knew not
this mystery, on learning that He is Lord in truth, cried out, and spake to those who came
to be baptized of him, “O generation of vipers,”1798 why look ye so earnestly at me? “I am
not the Christ;”1799 I am the servant, and not the lord; I am the subject, and not the king; I
am the sheep, and not the shepherd; I am a man, and not God. By my birth I loosed the
barrenness of my mother; I did not make virginity barren.1800 I was brought up from beneath;
I did not come down from above. I bound the tongue of my father;1801 I did not unfold divine
grace. I was known by my mother, and I was not announced by a star.1802 I am worthless,
and the least; but “after me there comes One who is before me”1803—after me, indeed, in
time, but before me by reason of the inaccessible and unutterable light of divinity. “There

comes One mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost, and with fire.”1804 I am subject to authority, but He has authority in Himself.
I am bound by sins, but He is the Remover of sins. I apply1805 the law, but He bringeth grace
to light. I teach as a slave, but He judgeth as the Master. I have the earth as my couch, but
He possesses heaven. I baptize with the baptism of repentance, but He confers the gift of
adoption: “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.” Why give ye attention
to me? I am not the Christ.</p>
<p>4. As John says these things to the multitude, and as the people watch in eager expectation
of seeing some strange spectacle with their bodily eyes, and the devil1806 is struck with
amazement at such a testimony from John, lo, the Lord appears, plain, solitary, uncovered,1807
without escort,1808 having on Him the body of man like a garment, and hiding the dignity
of the Divinity, that He may elude the snares of the dragon. And not only did He approach
John as Lord without royal retinue; but even like a mere man, and one involved in sin, He
bent His head to be baptized by John. Wherefore John, on seeing so great a humbling of
Himself, was struck with astonishment at the affair, and began to prevent Him, saying, as
ye have just heard, “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?”1809 What
doest Thou, O Lord? Thou teachest things not according to rule.1810 I have preached one
thing (regarding Thee), and Thou performest another; the devil has heard one thing, and
perceives another. Baptize me with the fire of Divinity; why waitest Thou for water? Enlighten
me with the Spirit; why dost Thou attend upon a creature? Baptize me, the Baptist, that Thy
pre-eminence may be known. I, O Lord, baptize with the baptism of repentance, and I
cannot baptize those who come to me unless they first confess fully their sins. Be it so then
that I baptize Thee, what hast Thou to confess? Thou art the Remover of sins, and wilt Thou
be baptized with the baptism of repentance? Though I should venture to baptize Thee, the
Jordan dares not to come near Thee. “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou
to me?”</p>
<p>5. And what saith the Lord to him? “Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to
fulfil all righteousness.”1811 “Suffer it to be so now,” John; thou art not wiser than I. Thou

seest as man; I foreknow as God. It becomes me to do this first, and thus to teach. I engage
in nothing unbecoming, for I am invested with honour. Dost thou marvel, O John, that I
am not come in my dignity? The purple robe of kings suits not one in private station, but
military splendour suits a king: am I come to a prince, and not to a friend? “Suffer it to be
so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness:” I am the Fulfiller of the law; I seek
to leave nothing wanting to its whole fulfilment, that so after me Paul may exclaim, “Christ
is the fulfilling of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”1812 “Suffer it to be
so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.” Baptize me, John, in order that
no one may despise baptism. I am baptized by thee, the servant, that no one among kings
or dignitaries may scorn to be baptized by the hand of a poor priest. Suffer me to go down
into the Jordan, in order that they may hear my Father’s testimony, and recognise the power
of the Son. “Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.” Then
at length John suffers Him. “And Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out of
the water: and the heavens were opened unto Him; and, lo, the Spirit of God descended like
a dove, and rested upon Him. And a voice (came) from heaven, saying, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased.”1813</p>
<p>6. Do you see, beloved, how many and how great blessings we would have lost, if the
Lord had yielded to the exhortation of John, and declined baptism? For the heavens were
shut before this; the region above was inaccessible. We would in that case descend to the
lower parts, but we would not ascend to the upper. But was it only that the Lord was baptized?
He also renewed the old man, and committed to him again the sceptre of adoption. For
straightway “the heavens were opened to Him.” A reconciliation took place of the visible
with the invisible; the celestial orders were filled with joy; the diseases of earth were healed;
secret things were made known; those at enmity were restored to amity. For you have heard
the word of the evangelist, saying, “The heavens were opened to Him,” on account of three
wonders. For when Christ the Bridegroom was baptized, it was meet that the bridal-chamber
of heaven should open its brilliant gates. And in like manner also, when the Holy Spirit
descended in the form of a dove, and the Father’s voice spread everywhere, it was meet that
“the gates of heaven should be lifted up.”1814 “And, lo, the heavens were opened to Him;
and a voice was heard, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</p>
<p>7. The beloved generates love, and the light immaterial the light inaccessible.1815 “This
is my beloved Son,” He who, being manifested on earth and yet unseparated from the

Father’s bosom, was manifested, and yet did not appear.1816 For the appearing is a different
thing, since in appearance the baptizer here is superior to the baptized. For this reason did
the Father send down the Holy Spirit from heaven upon Him who was baptized. For as in
the ark of Noah the love of God toward man is signified by the dove, so also now the Spirit,
descending in the form of a dove, bearing as it were the fruit of the olive, rested on Him to
whom the witness was borne. For what reason? That the faithfulness of the Father’s voice
might be made known, and that the prophetic utterance of a long time past might be ratified.
And what utterance is this? “The voice of the Lord (is) on the waters, the God of glory
thundered; the Lord (is) upon many waters.”1817 And what voice? “This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased.” This is He who is named the son of Joseph, and (who is) according
to the divine essence my Only-begotten. “This is my beloved Son”—He who is hungry,
and yet maintains myriads; who is weary, and yet gives rest to the weary; who has not where
to lay His head,1818 and yet bears up all things in His hand; who suffers, and yet heals sufferings;
who is smitten,1819 and yet confers liberty on the world;1820 who is pierced in the
side,1821 and yet repairs the side of Adam.1822</p>
<p>8. But give me now your best attention, I pray you, for I wish to go back to the fountain
of life, and to view the fountain that gushes with healing. The Father of immortality sent
the immortal Son and Word into the world, who came to man in order to wash him with
water and the Spirit; and He, begetting us again to incorruption of soul and body, breathed
into us the breath (spirit) of life, and endued us with an incorruptible panoply. If, therefore,
man has become immortal, he will also be God.1823 And if he is made God by water and
the Holy Spirit after the regeneration of the laver1824 he is found to be also joint-heir with
Christ1825 after the resurrection from the dead. Wherefore I preach to this effect: Come, all

ye kindreds of the nations, to the immortality of the baptism. I bring good tidings of life to
you who tarry in the darkness of ignorance. Come into liberty from slavery, into a kingdom
from tyranny, into incorruption from corruption. And how, saith one, shall we come? How?
By water and the Holy Ghost. This is the water in conjunction with the Spirit, by which
paradise is watered, by which the earth is enriched, by which plants grow, by which animals
multiply, and (to sum up the whole in a single word) by which man is begotten again and
endued with life, in which also Christ was baptized, and in which the Spirit descended in
the form of a dove.</p>
<p>9. This is the Spirit that at the beginning “moved upon the face of the waters;”1826 by
whom the world moves; by whom creation consists, and all things have life; who also wrought
mightily in the prophets,1827 and descended in flight upon Christ.1828 This is the Spirit that
was given to the apostles in the form of fiery tongues.1829 This is the Spirit that David sought
when he said, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.”1830
Of this Spirit Gabriel also spoke to the Virgin, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.”1831 By this Spirit Peter spake that blessed
word, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”1832 By this Spirit the rock of the
Church was stablished.1833 This is the Spirit, the Comforter, that is sent because of thee,1834
that He may show thee to be the Son1835 of God.</p>
<p>10. Come then, be begotten again, O man, into the adoption of God. And how? says
one. If thou practisest adultery no more, and committest not murder, and servest not idols;
if thou art not overmastered by pleasure; if thou dost not suffer the feeling of pride to rule
thee; if thou cleanest off the filthiness of impurity, and puttest off the burden of sin; if thou
castest off the armour of the devil, and puttest on the breastplate of faith, even as Isaiah
saith, “Wash you, and seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and plead
for the widow. And come and let us reason together, saith the Lord. Though your sins be
as scarlet, I shall make them white as snow; and though they be like crimson, I shall make
them white as wool. And if ye be willing, and hear my voice, ye shall eat the good of the

land.”1836 Do you see, beloved, how the prophet spake beforetime of the purifying power
of baptism? For he who comes down in faith to the laver of regeneration, and renounces
the devil, and joins himself to Christ; who denies the enemy, and makes the confession that
Christ is God; who puts off the bondage, and puts on the adoption,—he comes up from the
baptism brilliant as the sun,1837 flashing forth the beams of righteousness, and, which is
indeed the chief thing, he returns a son of God and joint-heir with Christ. To Him be the
glory and the power, together with His most holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now
and ever, and to all the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>

subject of generation;1841 it grows not, sleeps not, hungers not, thirsts not, is not wearied,
suffers not, dies not, is not pierced by nails and spear, sweats not, drops not with blood. Of
such kind are the natures of the angels and of souls released from the body. For both these
are of another kind, and different from these creatures of our world, which are visible and

should fulfil the mysteries prophesied of Him. In the Passover season, so as to exhibit
Himself as one destined to be sacrificed like a sheep, and to prove Himself the true Paschallamb,
even as the apostle says, “Even Christ,” who is God, “our passover was sacrificed for
us.”1853 And at Pentecost so as to presignify the kingdom of heaven as He Himself first ascended

and were corrupt, because of my foolishness.”1856 But the Lord was without sin, being of

Holy Spirit, covered, as it were, within and without with the purest gold of the Word of

Christ came into our life a mere man, and deny the talent of His divinity, or else, acknowledging
Him to be God, they deny, on the other hand, His humanity, and teach that His
appearances to those who saw Him as man were illusory, inasmuch as He did not bear with
Him true manhood, but was rather a kind of phantom manifestation. Of this class are, for
example, Marcion and Valentinus, and the Gnostics, who sunder the Word from the flesh,
and thus set aside the one talent, viz., the incarnation.</p>

I perceive, then, that the matter is one of contention. For he1865 speaks thus: Christ kept
the supper, then, on that day, and then suffered; whence it is needful that I, too, should keep
it in the same manner as the Lord did. But he has fallen into error by not perceiving that at
the time when Christ suffered He did not eat the passover of the law.1866 For He was the

<p>The story of a maiden of Corinth, and a certain Magistrianus.</p>
<p>The account given by Hippolytus, the friend of the apostles.1873</p>
<p>In another little book bearing the name of Hippolytus, the friend of the apostles, I found
a story of the following nature:—</p>
<p>There lived a certain most noble and beautiful maiden1874 in the city of Corinth, in the
careful exercise of a virtuous life. At that time some persons falsely charged her before the
judge there, who was a Greek, with cursing the times, and the princes, and the images. Now
those who trafficked in such things, brought her beauty under the notice of the impious
judge, who lusted after women. And he gladly received the accusation with his equine ears
and lascivious thoughts. And when she was brought before the bloodstained (judge), he was
driven still more frantic with profligate passion. But when, after bringing every device to
bear upon her, the profane than could not gain over this woman of God, he subjected the
noble maiden to various outrages. And when he failed in these too, and was unable to seduce
her from her confession of Christ, the cruel judge became furious against her, and gave her
over to a punishment of the following nature: Placing the chaste maiden in a brothel, he
charged the manager, saying, Take this woman, and bring me three nummi by her every
day. And the man, exacting the money from her by her dishonour, gave her up to any who
sought her in the brothel. And when the women-hunters knew that, they came to the brothel,
and, paying the price put upon their iniquity, sought to seduce her. But this most honourable
maiden, taking counsel with herself to deceive them, called them to her, and earnestly besought
them, saying: I have a certain ulceration of the pudenda, which has an extremely
hateful stench; and I am afraid that ye might come to hate me on account of the abominable
sore. Grant me therefore a few days, and then ye may have me even for nothing. With these
words the blessed maiden gained over the profligates, and dismissed them for a time.1875
And with most fitting prayers she importuned God, and with contrite supplications she
sought to turn Him to compassion. God, therefore, who knew her thoughts, and understood
how the chaste maiden was distressed in heart for her purity, gave ear to her; and the
Guardian of the safety of all men in those days interposed with His arrangements in the
following manner:—</p>
<p>Of a certain person Magistrianus.1876</p>

<pb n="602"/>
<p>There was a certain young man, Magistrianus,1877 comely in his personal appearance,
and of a pious mind, whom God had inspired with such a burning spiritual zeal, that he
despised even death itself. He, coming under the guise of profligacy, goes in, when the
evening was far gone, to the fellow who kept the women, and pays him five nummi, and
says to him, Permit me to spend this night with this damsel. Entering then with her into the
private apartment, he says to her, Rise, save thyself. And taking off her garments, and
dressing her in his own attire, his night-gown, his cloak, and all the habiliments of a man,
he says to her, Wrap yourself up with the top of your cloak, and go out; and doing so, and
signing herself entirely with the mystery of the cross, she went forth uncorrupted from that
place, and was preserved perfectly stainless by the grace of Christ, and by the instrumentality
of the young man, who by his own blood delivered her from dishonour. And on the following
day the matter became known, and Magistrianus was brought before the infuriated judge.
And when the cruel tyrant had examined the noble champion of Christ, and had learned
all, he ordered him to be thrown to the wild beasts,—that in this, too, the honour-hating
demon might be put to shame. For, whereas he thought to involve the noble youth in an
unhallowed punishment, he exhibited him as a double martyr for Christ, inasmuch as he
had both striven nobly for his own immortal soul, and persevered manfully in labours also
in behalf of that noble and blessed maiden. Wherefore also he was deemed worthy of double
honour with Christ, and of the illustrious and blessed crowns by His goodness.</p>

<head>Elucidation.</head>
<p>The conduct of Father Abraham, although not approved of by Inspiration, but simply
recorded (Gen. xxvi. 7), gave early Christians an opinion that the wicked may be justly foiled,
by equivocation and deception, for the preservation of innocence or the life of the innocent.
In such case the person deceived, they might argue, is not injured, but benefited (Gen. xxvi.
10), being saved from committing violence and murder. The Corinthian maiden was accustomed
to be veiled (as Tertullian intimates), and was taught alike to cherish her own purity
and to have no share in affording occasion of sin to others. See vol. iv. pp. 32, 33. Let us call
this narrative “The Story of Corinthia and Magistrianus.”</p>

<p>Since, then, the blessed prophets have been eyes to us, setting forth for our behoof the
clear declaration of things secret, both through life, and through declaration, and through
inspiration1879 of the Holy Spirit, and discoursing, too, of things not yet come to pass,1880
in this way also1881 to all generations they have pictured forth the grandest subjects for
contemplation and for action. Thus, too, they preached of the advent of God1882 in the
flesh to the world, His advent by the spotless and God-bearing1883 Mary in the way of birth
and growth, and the manner of His life and conversation with men, and His manifestation
by baptism, and the new birth that was to be to all men, and the regeneration by the laver;
and the multitude of His miracles, and His blessed passion on the cross, and the insults
which He bore at the hands of the Jews, and His burial, and His descent to Hades, and His
ascent again, and redemption of the spirits that were of old,1884 and the destruction of death,
and His life-giving awaking from the dead, and His re-creation of the whole world, and His
assumption and return to heaven, and His reception of the Spirit, of which the apostles were
deemed worthy, and again the second coming, that is destined to declare all things. For as
being designated seers,1885 they of necessity signified and spake of these things beforetime.</p>

<p>Hence, too, they indicated the day of the consummation to us, and signified beforehand
the day of the apostate that is to appear and deceive men at the last times, and the beginning
and end of his kingdom, and the advent of the Judge, and the life of the righteous, and the
punishment of the sinners, in order that we all, bearing these things in mind day by day and
hour by hour, as children of the Church, might know that “not one jot nor one tittle of these
things shall fail,”1886 as the Saviour’s own word announced. Let all of you, then, of necessity,
open the eyes of your hearts and the ears of your soul, and receive the word which we are
about to speak. For I shall unfold to you to-day a narration full of horror and fear, to wit,
the account of the consummation, and in particular, of the seduction of the whole world by
the enemy and devil; and after these things, the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Where, then, ye friends of Christ, shall I begin? and with what shall I make my commencement,
or what shall I expound? and what witness shall I adduce for the things spoken?
But let us take those (viz., the prophets) with whom we began this discourse, and adduce
them as credible witnesses, to confirm our exposition of the matters discussed; and after
them the teaching, or rather the prophecy, of the apostles, (so as to see) how throughout
the whole world they herald the day of the consummation. Since these, then, have also shown
beforetime things not yet come to pass, and have declared the devices and deceits of wicked
men, who are destined to be made manifest, come and let us bring forward Isaiah as our
first witness, inasmuch as he instructs us in the times of the consummation. What, then,
does he say? “Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers
devour it in your presence: the daughter of Zion shall be left as a cottage in a vineyard, and
as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.”1887 You see, beloved, the prophet’s
illumination, whereby he announced that time so many generations before. For it is not of
the Jews that he spake this word of old, nor of the city of Zion, but of the Church. For all
the prophets have declared Sion to be the bride brought from the nations.</p>

<p>Wherefore let us direct our discourse to a second witness. And of what sort is this one?
Listen to Osea, as he speaks thus grandly: “In those days the Lord shall bring on a burning
wind from the desert against them, and shall make their veins dry, and shall make their
springs desolate; and all their goodly vessels shall be spoiled. Because they rose up against
God, they shall fall by the sword, and their women with child shall be ripped up.”1888 And
what else is this burning wind from the east, than the Antichrist that is to destroy and dry
up the veins of the waters and the fruits of the trees in his times, because men set their hearts
on his works? For which reason he shall indeed destroy them, and they shall serve him in
his pollution.</p>

<p>Mark the agreement of prophet with prophet. Acquaint yourself also with another
prophet who expresses himself in like manner. For Amos prophesied of the same things in
a manner quite in accordance: “Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch therefore as ye have beaten
the poor with the fist,1889 and taken choice gifts from him: ye have built houses, but ye shall
not dwell in them: ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
For I know your manifold transgressions, in trampling justice beneath your foot, and taking
a bribe, and turning aside the poor in the gate from their right. Therefore the prudent shall
keep silence in that time, for it is an evil time.”1890 Learn, beloved, the wickedness of the
men of that time, how they spoil houses and fields, and take even justice from the just; for
when these things come to pass, ye may know that it is the end. For this reason art thou instructed
in the wisdom of the prophet, and the revelation that is to be in those days. And
all the prophets, as we have already said, have clearly signified the things that are to come
to pass in the last times, just as they also have declared things of old.</p>

<p>But not to expend our argument entirely in going over the words of all the prophets,1891
after citing one other, let us revert to the matter in hand. What is it, then, that Micah says
in his prophecy? “Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err,
that bite with their teeth, and cry to him, Peace; and if it was not put into their mouth,1892
they prepared1893 war against him. Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have
a vision;1894 and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall not go
down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. And the seers shall be ashamed,
and the diviners confounded.”1895 These things we have recounted beforehand, in order
that ye may know the pain that is to be in the last times, and the perturbation, and the
manner of life on the part of all men toward each other,1896 and their envy, and hate, and
strife, and the negligence of the shepherds toward the sheep, and the unruly disposition of
the people toward the priests.1897</p>

apostles, impostors, mischief-makers, evil-doers, liars against each other, adulterers, fornicators,
robbers, grasping, perjured, mendacious, hating each other. The shepherds will be
like wolves; the priests will embrace falsehood; the monks1900 will lust after the things of
the world; the rich will assume hardness of heart; the rulers will not help the poor; the
powerful will cast off all pity; the judges will remove justice from the just, and, blinded with
bribes, they will call in unrighteousness.</p>

<p>And what am I to say with respect to men,1901 when the very elements themselves will
disown their order? There will be earthquakes in every city, and plagues in every country;
and monstrous1902 thunderings and frightful lightnings will burn up both houses and fields.
Storms of winds will disturb both sea and land excessively; and there will be unfruitfulness
on the earth, and a roaring in the sea, and an intolerable agitation on account of souls and
the destruction of men.1903 There will be signs in the sun, and signs in the moon, deflections
in the stars, distresses of nations, intemperateness in the atmosphere, discharges of hail
upon the face of the earth, winters of excessive severity, different1904 frosts, inexorable
scorching winds, unexpected thunderings, unlooked-for conflagrations; and in general,
lamentation and mourning in the whole earth, without consolation. For, “because iniquity
shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”1905 By reason of the agitation and confusion
of all these, the Lord of the universe cries in the Gospel, saying, “Take heed that ye be not
deceived; for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and the time draweth near:
go ye not therefore after them. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:
for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not yet by and by.”1906 Let us
observe the word of the Saviour, how He always admonished us with a view to our security:
“Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ.”</p>

Wherefore also in the last day of the consummation, it must needs be that false Christs will
arise again, saying, “I am Christ,” and they will deceive many. And multitudes of men will
run from the east even to the west, and from the north even to the sea, saying, Where is
Christ here? where is Christ there? But being possessed of a vain conceit, and failing to read
the Scriptures carefully, and not being of an upright mind, they will seek for a name which

<p>And the apostles, who speak of God,1907 in establishing the truth of the advent of the
Lord Jesus Christ, have each of them indicated the appearing of these abominable and ruinworking
men, and have openly announced their lawless deeds. First of all Peter, the rock of
the faith, whom Christ our God called blessed, the teacher of the Church, the first disciple,
he who has the keys of the kingdom, has instructed us to this effect: “Know this first, children,
that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts.1908 And there
shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies.”1909 After
him, John the theologian,1910 and the beloved of Christ, in harmony with him, cries, “The
children of the devil are manifest;1911 and even now are there many antichrists;1912 but go
not after them.1913 Believe not every spirit, because many false prophets are gone out into
the world.”1914 And then Jude, the brother of James, speaks in like manner: “In the last
times there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts. There be they who,
without fear, feed1915 themselves.”1916 You have observed the concord of the theologians
and apostles, and the harmony of their doctrine.</p>

<p>But having now done with this account of the consummation, we shall turn our exposition
to those matters which fall to be stated by us next in order. I adduce, therefore, a witness
altogether worthy of credit,—namely, the prophet Daniel, who interpreted the vision of
Nabuchodonosor, and from the beginning of the kings down to their end indicated the
right1920 way to those who seek to walk therein—to wit, the manifestation of the truth. For
what saith the prophet? He presignified the matter clearly to Nabuchodonosor in the following
terms: “Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image standing before thee, whose
head was of gold, its arms and shoulders of silver, its belly and thighs of brass, its legs of
iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without
hand; and it smote the image upon its feet, which were part of iron and part of clay, and
brake them to pieces. Then was the clay, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the
gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floor;
and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.”1921</p>

<head>XIII.</head>
<p>Wherefore, bringing the visions of Daniel into conjunction with these, we shall make
one narrative of the two, and show how true and consistent were the things seen in vision
by the prophet with those which Nabuchodonosor saw beforehand. For the prophet speaks
thus: “I Daniel saw, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.
And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. The first was like a
lioness, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted
up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given it.
And behold a second beast, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three
ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much
flesh. After this I beheld, and lo a third beast, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it
four wings of a fowl: the beast had also four heads. After this I saw, and behold a fourth
beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; its great iron teeth and its claws of
brass1922 devoured and brake in pieces, and it stamped the residue with the feet of it: and
it was diverse exceedingly from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. I
considered its horns, and, behold, there came up among them a little horn, and before it
there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were
eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.”1923</p>
<note type="footnote">1922 These words, καὶ οἱ ὄνυχες αὐτοῦ χαλκοῖ, are strange both to the Greek and the Hebrew text of Daniel.</note>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">

<head>XIV.</head>
<p>Now, since these things which are thus spoken mystically by the prophet seem to all to
be hard to understand, we shall conceal none of them from those who are possessed of sound
mind. By mentioning the first beast, namely the lioness that comes up out of the sea, Daniel
means the kingdom of the Babylonians which was set up in the world; and that same is also
the “golden head” of this image. And by speaking of its “wings like an eagle,” he shows that
king Nabuchodonosor was elevated and exalted himself against God. Then he says that its
“wings were plucked out,” and means by this that his glory was subverted: for he was driven
from his kingdom. And in stating that a “man’s heart was given it, and it was made stand
upon the feet like a man,” he means that he repented, and acknowledged that he was himself
but a man, and gave the glory to God. Lo, I have thus unfolded the similitude of the first
beast.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<pb n="618"/>
<head>XV.</head>
<p>Then after the lioness, the prophet sees a second beast like a bear, which denoted the
Persians; for after the Babylonians the Persians had the sovereignty. And in saying, “I saw
three ribs in the mouth of it,” he referred to three nations, the Persians, Medes, and Babylonians,
which were also expressed by the silver that came after the gold in the image. Behold,
we have explained the second beast too. Then the third was the leopard, by which were
meant the Greeks. For after the Persians, Alexander king of the Macedonians held the sovereignty,
when he had destroyed Darius; and this is expressed by the brass in the image.
And in speaking of “four wings of a fowl, and four heads in the beast,” he showed most
clearly how the kingdom of Alexander was divided into four parts. For it had four
heads,—namely, the four kings that rose out of it. For on his death-bed1924 Alexander divided
his kingdom into four parts. Behold, we have discussed the third also.</p>

<head>XVI.</head>
<p>Next he tells us of the “fourth beast, dreadful and terrible; its teeth were of iron, and its
claws of brass.” And what is meant by these but the kingdom of the Romans, which also is
meant by the iron, by which it will crush all the seats of empire that were before it, and will
lord it over the whole earth? After this, then, what is left for us to interpret of all that the
prophet saw, but the “toes of the image, in which part was of iron and part of clay, mingled
together in one?” For by the ten toes of the image he meant figuratively the ten kings who
sprang out of it, as Daniel also interpreted the matter. For he says, “I considered the beast,
namely the fourth; and behold ten horns after it, among which another horn arose like an
offshoot; and it will pluck up by the root three of those before it.” And by this offshoot horn
none other is signified than the Antichrist that is to restore the kingdom of the Jews. And
the three horns which are to be rooted out by it signify three kings, namely those of Egypt,
Libya, and Ethiopia, whom he will destroy in the array of war; and when he has vanquished
them all, being a savage tyrant, he will raise tribulation and persecution against the saints,
exalting himself against them.</p>

<p>You see how Daniel interpreted to Nabuchodonosor the dominion of the kingdoms;
you see how he explained the form of the image in all its parts1925 you have observed how
he indicated prophetically the meaning of the coming up of the four beasts out of the sea.
It remains that we open up to you the things done by the Antichrist in particular; and, as
far as in our power, declare to you by means of the Scriptures and the prophets, his wandering
over the whole earth, and his lawless advent.</p>

<p>As the Lord Jesus Christ made His sojourn with us in the flesh (which He received)
from the holy, immaculate Virgin, and took to Himself the tribe of Judah, and came forth
from it, the Scripture declared His royal lineage in the word of Jacob, when in his benediction
he addressed himself to his son in these terms: “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall
praise: thy hands shall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down
before thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp; from a sprout,1926 my son, thou art gone up: he stooped
down, he couched as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp:1927 who shall rouse him up? A ruler1928
shall not depart from Judah, nor a leader1929 from his thighs,1930 until what is in store for
him1931 shall come, and he is the expectation1932 of the nations.”1933 Mark these words of
Jacob which were spoken to Judah, and are fulfilled in the Lord. To the same effect, moreover,
does the patriarch express himself regarding Antichrist. Wherefore, as he prophesied with
respect to Judah, so did he also with respect to his son Dan. For Judah was his fourth son;
and Dan, again, was his seventh son. And what, then, did he say of him? “Let Dan be a serpent
sitting by the way, that biteth the horse’s heel?”1934 And what serpent was there but the
deceiver from the beginning, he who is named in Genesis, he who deceived Eve, and bruised
Adam in the heel?1935</p>

<p>But seeing now that we must make proof of what is alleged at greater length, we shall
not shrink from the task. For it is certain that he is destined to spring from the tribe of
Dan,1936 and to range himself in opposition like a princely tyrant, a terrible judge and accuser,
1937 as the prophet testifies when he says, “Dan shall judge his people, as one tribe in
Israel.”1938 But some one may say that this was meant of Samson, who sprang from the tribe
of Dan, and judged his people for twenty years. That, however, was only partially made good
in the case of Samson; but this shall be fulfilled completely in the case of Antichrist. For
Jeremiah, too, speaks in this manner: “From Dan we shall hear the sound of the sharpness1939
of his horses; at the sound of the neighing1940 of his horses the whole land trembled.”1941
And again, Moses says: “Dan is a lion’s whelp, and he shall leap from Bashan.”1942 And
that no one may fall into the mistake of thinking that this is spoken of the Saviour, let him
attend to this. “Dan,” says he, “is a lion’s whelp;” and by thus naming the tribe of Dan as
the one whence the accuser is destined to spring, he made the matter in hand quite clear.
For as Christ is born of the tribe of Judah, so Antichrist shall be born of the tribe of Dan.
And as our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was spoken of in prophecy as a
lion on account or His royalty and glory, in the same manner also has the Scripture prophetically
described the accuser as a lion, on account of his tyranny and violence.</p>

<p>For in every respect that deceiver seeks to make himself appear like the Son of God.
Christ is a lion, and Antichrist is a lion. Christ is King of things celestial and things terrestrial,
and Antichrist will be king upon earth. The Saviour was manifested as a lamb; and he, too,
will appear as a lamb, while he is a wolf within. The Saviour was circumcised, and he in like
manner will appear in circumcision. The Saviour sent the apostles unto all the nations, and
he in like manner will send false apostles. Christ gathered together the dispersed sheep, and
he in like manner will gather together the dispersed people of the Hebrews. Christ gave to
those who believed on Him the honourable and life-giving cross, and he in like manner will
give his own sign. Christ appeared in the form of man, and he in like manner will come
forth in the form of man. Christ arose from among the Hebrews, and he will spring from
among the Jews. Christ displayed His flesh like a temple, and raised it up on the third day;
and he too will raise up again the temple of stone in Jerusalem. And these deceits fabricated
by him will become quite intelligible to those who listen to us attentively, from what shall
be set forth next in order.</p>

<head>XXI.</head>
<p>For through the Scriptures we are instructed in two advents of the Christ and Saviour.
And the first after the flesh was in humiliation, because He was manifested in lowly estate.
So then His second advent is declared to be in glory; for He comes from heaven with power,
and angels, and the glory of His Father. His first advent had John the Baptist as its forerunner;
and His second, in which He is to come in glory, will exhibit Enoch, and Elias, and John the
Divine.1943 Behold, too, the Lord’s kindness to man; how even in the last times He shows
His care for mortals, and pities them. For He will not leave us even then without prophets,
but will send them to us for our instruction and assurance, and to make us give heed to the
advent of the adversary, as He intimated also of old in this Daniel. For he says, “I shall make
a covenant of one week, and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and libation will be removed.”
For by one week he indicates the showing forth of the seven years which shall be
in the last times.1944 And the half of the week the two prophets, along with John, will take
for the purpose of proclaiming to all the world the advent of Antichrist, that is to say, for a
“thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth;”1945 and they will work signs
and wonders with the object of making men ashamed and repentant, even by these means,
on account of their surpassing lawlessness and impiety. “And if any man will hurt them,
fire will proceed out of their mouth, and devour their enemies. These have power to shut
heaven, that it rain not in the days of the advent of Antichrist, and to turn waters into blood,
and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.”1946 And when they have proclaimed
all these things they will fall on the sword, cut off by the accuser1947. And they will
fulfil their testimony, as Daniel also says; for he foresaw that the beast that came up out of
the abyss would make war with them, namely with Enoch, Elias, and John, and would
overcome them, and kill them, because of their refusal to give glory to the accuser, that is
<note type="footnote">1943 Or, the theologian. The Apocalypse (xi. 3) mentions only two witnesses, who are understood by the
ancients in general as Enoch and Elias. The author of the Chronicon Paschale, p. 21, on Enoch, says: “This is he
who, along with Elias, is to withstand Antichrist in the last days, and to confute his deceit, according to the tradition
of the Church.” This addition as to the return of John the Evangelist is somewhat more uncommon. And
yet Ephraem of Antioch, in Photius, cod. ccxxix., states that this too is supported by ancient, ecclesiastical tradition,
Christ’s saying in John xxi. 22 being understood to that effect. See also Hippolytus, De Antichristo, ch. l. p. 213,

<p>But as, in accordance with the train of our discussion, we have been constrained to come
to the matter of the days of the dominion of the adversary, it is necessary to state in the first
place what concerns his nativity and growth; and then we must turn our discourse, as we
have said before, to the expounding of this matter, viz., that in all respects the accuser and
son of lawlessness1949 is to make himself like our Saviour. Thus also the demonstration
makes the matter clear to us. Since the Saviour of the world, with the purpose of saving the
race of men, was born of the immaculate and virgin Mary,1950 and in the form of the flesh
trod the enemy under foot, in the exercise of the power of His own proper divinity; in the
same manner also will the accuser come forth from an impure woman upon the earth, but
shall be born of a virgin spuriously.1951 For our God sojourned with us in the flesh, after
that very flesh of ours which He made for Adam and all Adam’s posterity, yet without sin.
But the accuser, though he take up the flesh, will do it only in appearance; for how should
we wear that flesh which he did not make himself, but against which he warreth daily? And
it is my opinion, beloved, that he will assume this phenomenal kind of flesh1952 as an instrument.
1953 For this reason also is he to be born of a virgin, as if a spirit, and then to the rest
he will be manifested as flesh. For as to a virgin bearing, this we have known only in the
case of the all-holy Virgin, who bore the Saviour verily clothed in flesh.1954 For Moses says,
“Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy unto the Lord.”1955 This is by no
means the case with him;1956 but as the adversary will not open the womb, so neither will
he take to himself real flesh, and be circumcised as Christ was circumcised. And even as
Christ chose His apostles, so will he too assume a whole people of disciples like himself in
wickedness.</p>

<p>Above all, moreover, he will love the nation of the Jews. And with all these he will work
signs and terrible wonders, false wonders and not true, in order to deceive his impious
equals. For if it were possible, he would seduce even the elect1957 from the love of Christ.
But in his first steps he will be gentle, loveable, quiet, pious, pacific, hating injustice, detesting
gifts, not allowing idolatry; loving, says he, the Scriptures, reverencing priests, honouring

cleansing lepers, raising paralytics, expelling demons, proclaiming things remote just
as things present, raising the dead, helping widows, defending orphans, loving all, reconciling
in love men who contend, and saying to such, “Let not the sun go down upon your

<p>And all this he will do corruptly and deceitfully, and with the purpose of deluding all
to make him king. For when the peoples and tribes see so great virtues and so great powers
in him, they will all with one mind meet together to make him king. And above all others
shall the nation of the Hebrews be dear to the tyrant himself, while they say one to another,
Is there found indeed in our generation such a man, so good and just? That shall be the way
with the race of the Jews pre-eminently, as I said before, who, thinking, as they do, that they
shall behold the king himself in such power, will approach him to say, We all confide in
thee, and acknowledge thee to be just upon the whole earth; we all hope to be saved by thee;
and by thy mouth we have received just and incorruptible judgment.</p>

<p>And at first, indeed, that deceitful and lawless one, with crafty deceitfulness, will refuse
such glory; but the men persisting, and holding by him, will declare him king. And thereafter
he will be lifted up in heart, and he who was formerly gentle will become violent, and he
who pursued love will become pitiless, and the humble in heart will become haughty and
inhuman, and the hater of unrighteousness will persecute the righteous. Then, when he is
elevated to his kingdom, he will marshal war; and in his wrath he will smite three mighty
kings,—those, namely, of Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia. And after that he will build the temple
in Jerusalem, and will restore it again speedily, and give it over to the Jews. And then he will
be lifted up in heart against every man; yea, he will speak blasphemy also against God,
thinking in his deceit that he shall be king upon the earth hereafter for ever; not knowing,
miserable wretch, that his kingdom is to be quickly brought to nought, and that he will
quickly have to meet the fire which is prepared for him, along with all who trust him and
serve him. For when Daniel said, “I shall make my covenant for one week,”1959 he indicated
seven years; and the one half of the week is for the preaching of the prophets, and for the
other half of the week—that is to say, for three years and a half—Antichrist will reign upon
the earth. And after this his kingdom and his glory shall be taken away. Behold, ye who love
God, what manner of tribulation there shall rise in those days, such as has not been from
the foundation of the world, no, nor ever shall be, except in those days alone. Then the
lawless one, being lifted up in heart, will gather together his demons in man’s form, and will
abominate those who call him to the kingdom, and will pollute many souls.</p>

<p>For he will appoint princes over them from among the demons. And he will no longer
seem to be pious, but altogether and in all things he will be harsh, severe, passionate,
wrathful, terrible, inconstant, dread, morose, hateful, abominable, savage, vengeful, iniquitous.
And, bent on casting the whole race of men into the pit of perdition, he will multiply
false signs. For when all the people greet him with their acclamations at his displays, he will
shout with a strong voice, so that the place shall be shaken in which the multitudes stand
by him: “Ye peoples, and tribes, and nations, acquaint yourselves with my mighty authority
and power, and the strength of my kingdom. What prince is there so great as I am? What
great God is there but I? Who will stand up against my authority?” Under the eye of the
spectators he will remove mountains from their places, he will walk on the sea with dry feet,
he will bring down fire from heaven, he will turn the day into darkness and the night into
day, he will turn the sun about wheresoever he pleases; and, in short, in presence of those
who behold him, he will show all the elements of earth and sea to be subject to him in the
power of his specious manifestation. For if, while as yet he does not exhibit himself as the
son of perdition, he raises and excites against us open war even to battles and slaughters, at
that time when he shall come in his own proper person, and men shall see him as he is in
reality, what machinations and deceits and delusions will he not bring into play, with the
purpose of seducing all men, and leading them off from the way of truth, and from the gate

<p>Then, after all these things, the heavens will not give their dew, the clouds will not give

shall be dried up, the fish of the sea shall die, men shall perish of hunger and thirst; and
father embracing son, and mother embracing daughter, will die together, and there will be
none to bury them. But the whole earth will be filled with the stench arising from the dead
bodies cast forth. And the sea, not receiving the floods of the rivers, will become like mire,
and will be filled with an unlimited smell and stench. Then there will be a mighty pestilence
upon the whole earth, and then, too, inconsolable lamentation, and measureless weeping,
and unceasing mourning. Then men will deem those happy who are dead before them, and
will say to them, “Open your sepulchres, and take us miserable beings in; open your receptacles
for the reception of your wretched kinsmen and acquaintances. Happy are ye, in that
ye have not seen our days. Happy are ye, in that ye have not had to witness this painful life

<p>Then that abominable one will send his commands throughout every government by
the hand at once of demons and of visible men, who shall say, “A mighty king has arisen
upon the earth; come ye all to worship him; come ye all to see the strength of his kingdom:
for, behold, he will give you corn; and he will bestow upon you wine, and great riches, and
lofty honours. For the whole earth and sea obeys his command. Come ye all to him.” And
by reason of the scarcity of food, all will go to him and worship him; and he will put his
mark on their right hand and on their forehead, that no one may put the sign of the honourable
cross upon his forehead with his right hand; but his hand is bound. And from that time
he shall not have power to seal any one of his members, but he shall be attached to the deceiver,
and shall serve him; and in him there is no repentance. But such an one is lost at
once to God and to men, and the deceiver will give them scanty food by reason of his abominable
seal. And his seal upon the forehead and upon the right hand is the number, “Six
hundred threescore and six.”1960 And I have an opinion as to this number, though I do not
know the matter for certain; for many names have been found in this number when it is
expressed in writing.1961 Still we say that perhaps the scription of this same seal will give us
the word I deny.1962 For even in recent days, by means of his ministers—that is to say, the
idolaters—that bitter adversary took up the word deny, when the lawless pressed upon the
witnesses of Christ, with the adjuration, “Deny thy God, the crucified One.”1963</p>

<p>Of such kind, in the time of that hater of all good, will be the seal, the tenor of which
will be this: I deny the Maker of heaven and earth, I deny the baptism, I deny my (former)
service, and attach myself to thee, and I believe in thee. For this is what the prophets Enoch
and Elias will preach: Believe not the enemy who is to come and be seen; for he is an ad-
versary1964 and corrupter and son of perdition, and deceives you;1965 and for this reason
he will kill you, and smite them with the sword. Behold the deceit of the enemy, know the
machinations of the beguiler, how he seeks to darken the mind of men utterly. For he will
show forth his demons brilliant like angels, and he will bring in hosts of the incorporeal
without number. And in the presence of all he exhibits himself as taken up into heaven with
trumpets and sounds, and the mighty shouting of those who hail him with indescribable
hymns; the heir of darkness himself shining like light, and at one time soaring to the heavens,
and at another descending to the earth with great glory, and again charging the demons,
like angels, to execute his behests with much fear and trembling. Then will he send the cohorts
of the demons among mountains and caves and dens of the earth, to track out those who
have been concealed from his eyes, and to bring them forward to worship him. And those
who yield to him he will seal with his seal; but those who refuse to submit to him he will
consume with incomparable pains and bitterest torments and machinations, such as never
have been, nor have reached the ear of man, nor have been seen by the eye of mortals.</p>

<p>But let us revert to the matter in hand. When men have received the seal, then, and
find neither food nor water, they will approach him with a voice of anguish, saying, Give
us to eat and drink, for we all faint with hunger and all manner of straits;1966 and bid the
heavens yield us water, and drive off from us the beasts that devour men. Then will that
crafty one make answer, mocking them with absolute inhumanity, and saying, The heavens
refuse to give rain, the earth yields not again its fruits; whence then can I give you food?
Then, on hearing the words of this deceiver, these miserable men will perceive that this is
the wicked accuser, and will mourn in anguish, and weep vehemently, and beat their face
with their hands, and tear their hair, and lacerate their cheeks with their nails, while they
say to each other: Woe for the calamity! woe for the bitter contract! woe for the deceitful
covenant! woe for the mighty mischance! How have we been beguiled by the deceiver! how
have we been joined to him! how have we been caught in his toils! how have we been taken
in his abominable net! how have we heard the Scriptures, and understood them not! For
truly those who are engrossed with the affairs of life, and with the lust of this world, will be
easily brought over to the accuser then, and sealed by him.</p>

Thou didst fashion us, Thou didst make us of four elements, Thou didst give us spirit and

Thee to be God, we knew Thee to be Creator; in Thee we wrought sights, through Thee we
cast out demons, for Thee we mortified the flesh, for Thee we preserved virginity, for Thee
we practised chastity, for Thee we became strangers on the earth; and Thou sayest, I know

me as Lord, but ye kept not my words. Ye were marked with the seal of my cross, but ye
deleted it by your hardness of heart. Ye obtained my baptism, but ye observed not my
commandments. Ye subdued your body to virginity, but ye kept not mercy, but ye did not
cast the hatred of your brother out of your souls. For not every one that saith to me, Lord,

Italy, and Asia, and was afterwards crucified by Nero in Rome with his head downward, as
he had himself desired to suffer in that manner.</p>
<p>2. Andrew preached to the Scythians and Thracians, and was crucified, suspended on
an olive tree, at Patræ, a town of Achaia; and there too he was buried.</p>
<p>3. John, again, in Asia, was banished by Domitian the king to the isle of Patmos, in
which also he wrote his Gospel and saw the apocalyptic vision; and in Trajan’s time he fell
asleep at Ephesus, where his remains were sought for, but could not be found.</p>
<p>4. James, his brother, when preaching in Judea, was cut off with the sword by Herod
the tetrarch, and was buried there.</p>

in the time of Domitian, and was buried there.</p>
<p>6. Bartholomew, again, preached to the Indians, to whom he also gave the Gospel according
to Matthew, and was crucified with his head downward, and was buried in Allanum,2019

<p>9. And James the son of Alphæus, when preaching in Jerusalem, was stoned to death
by the Jews, and was buried there beside the temple.</p>
<p>10. Jude, who is also called Lebbæus, preached to the people of Edessa,2025 and to all
Mesopotamia, and fell asleep at Berytus, and was buried there.</p>
<p>11. Simon the Zealot,2026 the son of Clopas, who is also called Jude, became bishop of
Jerusalem after James the Just, and fell asleep and was buried there at the age of 120 years.</p>

<head>Canons of the Church of Alexandria.</head>
<p>Wrongly ascribed to Hippolytus.2075</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Those are the canons
of the Church, ordinances which Hippolytus wrote, by whom the Church speaketh; and the
number of them is thirty-eight canons. Greeting from the Lord.</p>
<p>Canon First. Of the Catholic faith. Before all things should we speak of the faith, holy
and right, regarding our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and we have consequently
placed that canon in the faith (the symbol); and we agree in this with all reasonable
certitude, that the Trinity is equal perfectly in honour, and equal in glory, and has neither
beginning nor end. The Word is the Son of God, and is Himself the Creator of every creature,
of things visible and invisible. This we lay down with one accord, in opposition to those
who have said boldly, that it is not right to speak of the Word of God as our Lord Jesus Christ
spake. We come together chiefly to bring out the holy truth2076 regarding God; and we have
separated them, because they do not agree with the Church in theology, nor with us the
sons of the Scriptures. On this account we have sundered them from the Church, and have
left what concerns them to God, who will judge His creatures with justice.2077 To those,
moreover, who are not cognisant of them, we make this known without ill-will, in order
that they may not rush into an evil death, like heretics, but may gain eternal life, and teach
their sons and their posterity this one true faith.</p>
<p>Canon Second. Of bishops. A bishop should be elected by all the people, and he should
be unimpeachable, as it is written of him in the apostle; in the week in which he is ordained,
the whole people should also say, We desire him; and there should be silence in the whole
hall, and they should all pray in his behalf, and say, O God, stablish him whom Thou hast
prepared for us, etc.</p>
<p>Canon Third. Prayer in behalf of him who is made bishop, and the ordinance of the
Missa.2078 O God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God
of all consolation, etc.</p>
<p>Canon Fourth. Of the ordination of a presbyter.</p>
<p>Canon Fifth. Of the constituting a deacon.</p>
<p>Canon Sixth. Of those who have suffered for the faith.</p>
<p>Canon Seventh. Of him who is elected reader and sub-deacon.</p>

has taken the sacred mysteries, especially in the days of fasting.</p>
<p>Canon Twenty-ninth. Of the keeping of oblations which are laid upon the altar,—that
nothing fall into the sacred chalice, and that nothing fall from the priests, nor from the boys

not a bishop be bound to fasting but with the clergy. And on account of a feast or supper,
let him prepare for the poor.2082</p>

present,—let him do his part in prayer and the breaking of bread for a blessing, and not for
the body; and of the discharge of widows.</p>

of presses, oil, honey, milk, wool, and the like, which may be offered to the bishop for his
blessing.</p>

and presbyters be gathered together, clothed in white robes, brilliant in the view of all the
people; and in like manner with a reader.</p>
<p>Canon Thirty-eighth. Of the night on which our Lord Jesus Christ rose. That no one
shall sleep on that night, and wash himself with water; and a declaration concerning such
a one; and a declaration concerning him who sins after baptism, and of things lawful and
unlawful.</p>
<p>The sacred canons of the holy patriarch Hippolytus, the first patriarch of the great city
of Rome,2083 which he composed, are ended; and the number of them is thirty-eight canons.
May the Lord help us to keep them. And to God be glory for ever, and on us be His mercy
for ever. Amen.</p>

(The God-bearing Mary, p. 242.)</p>
<p>“This name” (θεοτόκος), says Pearson, “was first in use in the Greek Church, which,
delighting in the happy compositions of that language, so called the Blessed Virgin; from
which the Latins, in imitation, styled her Virginem Deiparam,” etc.…Yet those ancient
Greeks which call the Virgin θεοτόκος, did not call her μητέρα τοῦ Θεοῦ, “Mother of God.”
This was very different to a pious ear, and rests on no synodical authority. The very learned
notes of Pearson, On the Creed, pp. 297, 299, should by all means be consulted. Leo of Rome,
called “the Great,” seems to have coined the less orthodox expression, relying on Holy
Scripture, indeed, in the salutation of Elisabeth (Luke i. 43). This term has been sadly abused
for Mariolatry.</p>

<p>II.
(Synaxis, p. 257.)</p>
<p>It seems to me worth while to quote a few words from the new and critical edition of
Leighton’s Works, which should be consulted for fuller information.2084 The editor says:
“Leighton uses a word for the Holy Communion which is worth noting, because it is rarely
used by Western theologians.” The word Synaxis is but a Christianized form of the word
Synagogue; but, like the word κοινωνία, it points to Christ’s mystical body,—“gathering
together in one the children of God.” Synaxis = συνάγει εἰς ἕν. It sums up the idea, “We,
being many, are one Bread and one Body, for we are all partakers of that one Bread.” Compare
John xi. 52 and 1 Cor. x. 15.</p>
<p>St. Chrysostom calls the Synaxis φρικωδεστάτη, which is a very different thing from
maxime tremenda, as applied to the modern “Mass,” in behalf of which it is quoted. For
Chrysostom applies it to the participation of the “Synaxis,” and not to the “oblation,” much
less to the “Host” as an object of adoration, of which he never heard or dreamed. He calls
“the Synaxis” Shudderful (to borrow a word from the Germans), because the unworthy recipient,
in the Synaxis, eats and drinks his own condemnation.2085 One must ever be on his
guard against the subtlety which reads into the Fathers modern ideas under ancient
<note type="footnote">2084 Leighton, Works, edited by West, of Nairn, vol. vi. p. 243, note. London, Longmans, 1870.</note>

<pb n="668"/>
<head>Introductory Notice to Cyprian.</head>
<p>[a.d. 200–258.] If Hippolytus reflects the spirit of Irenæus in all his writings, it is not
remarkable. He was the spiritual son of the great Bishop of Lyons, and deeply imbued with
the family character imparted to his disciples by the blessed presbyter of Patmos and Ephesus.
But while Cyprian is the spiritual son and pupil of Tertullian, we must seek his characteristics
and the key to his whole ministry in the far-off See and city where the disciples were
first called Christians. Cyprian is the Ignatius of the West. We see in his works how truly
historical are the writings of Ignatius, and how diffused was his simple and elementary system
of organic unity. It embodies no hierarchical assumption, no “lordship over God’s heritage,”
but is conceived in the spirit of St. Peter when he disclaimed all this, and said, “The presbyters
who are among you I exhort, who am also a presbyter.” Cyprian was indeed a strenuous asserter
of the responsibilities of his office; but he built upon that system universally recognised
by the Great Councils, which the popes and their adherents have ever laboured to destroy.
Nothing can be more delusive than the idea that the mediæval system derives any support
from Cyprian’s theory of the episcopate or of Church organization. His was the system of
the universal parity and community of bishops. In his scheme the apostolate was perpetuated
in the episcopate, and the presbyterate was an apostolic institution, by which others were
associated with bishops in all their functions as co-presbyters, but not in those reserved to
the presidency of the churches. Feudal ideas imposed a very different system upon the simple
framework of original Catholicity. But a careful study of that primitive framework, and of
the history of papal development, makes evident the following propositions:—</p>
<p>1. That Cyprian’s maxim, Ecclesia in Episcopo, whatever else he may have meant by it,
is an aphoristic statement of the Nicene Constitutions. These were embedded in the Ignatian
theory of an episcopate without a trace of a papacy; and Cyprian’s maxims had to be practically
destroyed in the West before it was possible to raise the portentous figure of a supreme
pontiff, and to subject the Latin churches to the entirely novel principle of Ecclesia in Papa.
To this novelty Cyprian’s system is essentially antagonistic.</p>
<p>2. It will be seen that Cyprian, far from being the patron of ecclesiastical despotism, is
the expounder of early canons and constitutions, in the spirit of order and discipline, indeed,
but with the largest exemplification of that “liberty” which is manifested wherever “the
Spirit of the Lord” is operative. Cyprian is the patron and defender of the presbytery and of
lay co-operation, as well as of the regimen of the episcopate. His letters illustrate the Catholic
system as it was known to the Nicene Fathers; but, of all the Christian Fathers, he is the
most clear and comprehensive in his conception of the body of Christ as an organic whole,

<pb n="669"/>
in which every member has an honourable function.2087 Popular government and representative
government, the legitimate power and place of the laity, the organization of the
Christian plebs into their faculty as the ἀντιλήψεις of St. Paul,2088 the development of synods,
omni plebe adstante,—all this is embodied in the Catholic system as Cyprian understood it.</p>
<p>3. The Orientals2089 in large degree, even under their yoke of bondage and the superstitions
engendered by their decay, have ever adhered to this Ignatian theory, of which Cyprian
was the great expounder in the West; while the terrible schism of the ninth century, which
removed the West from the Nicene basis, and placed the Latin churches upon the foundation
of the forged Decretals,2090 was effected by ignoring the Cyprianic maxims, and then by a
practical pulverizing of their fundamental principle of unity. This change involved a subversion
of the primitive episcopate, an annihilation of the rights of the presbytery, and a total
abasement of the laity; in a word, the destruction of synodical constitutions and of constitutional
freedom.</p>
<p>4. The constitutional primacy, of which Cyprian was an early promotor, had to be entirely
destroyed by decretalism before the papacy could exist. Gregory the Great stood upon the
Cyprianic base when he pronounced the author of a scheme for a “universal bishopric” to
be a forerunner of Antichrist. It was the spirit of the Decretals to substitute the fictitious
idea of a divine supremacy in one bishop and one See, for the canonical presidency of a
bishop who was only primus inter pares.</p>
<p>5. Hence the Cyprianic system has ever been the great resource of the “Gallicans against
the Ultramontanes” in the cruel but most interesting history of the West. From the Council
of Frankfort to our own times Cyprian’s spirit is reflected in Hincmar, in Gerbert, in the
Gallican canonists, in De Marca, in Bossuet, in Launoy, in Dupin, in Pascal, in the Jansenists
(Augustinians), and by the Old Catholics in their late uprising against the dogmatic triumph
of Ultramontanism. Nobody can understand the history of Latin Christianity without
mastering the system of Cyprian, and comprehending the entirely hostile and uncatholic
system of the Decretals.</p>
<p>6. I am not anxious to conceal the fact that I profoundly sympathize with the free spirit,
the true benignity, and the moral purity which are everywhere reflected in the writings of
Cyprian. If ever American Romanism becomes sufficiently enlightened and purified to
comprehend this great Carthaginian Father, and to speak in his tones to the Bishop of Rome,
a glorious reformation of this alien religion will be the result; and then we may comprehend
<note type="footnote">2087 Eph. iv. 15, 16; 1 Cor. xii. 12–30. I have little doubt that our author’s theory was guided by his conceptions

the mysterious Providence which has transferred to these shores so many subjects of the
despotism of the Vatican. Meanwhile the student of the Ante-Nicene Fathers will not be
slow to perceive that he has, in the eight volumes of this series, all that is needful to disarm
Romanism, to refute its pretensions, and to direct honest and truth-loving spirits in the
Roman Obedience to the door of escape opened by Döllinger and his associates in the “Old
Catholic” effort for the restoration of the Latin churches. Let us “speak the truth in love,”
and pray the Lord to bless this and every endeavour to promote and to sanctify the spirit of
enlightened research after the “pattern in the mount.” For “thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in
the ways, and see and ask for the old paths:” τὰ ἀρχαῖα ἔθη. The following Introduction,
from the Edinburgh editor, supplies further answers to inquiry, and suffices to elucidate the
subjoined narrative of Pontius.</p>
<p>Little is known of the early history of Thascius Cyprian (born probably about 200 a.d.)
until the period of his intimacy with the Carthaginian presbyter Cæcilius, which led to his
conversion a.d. 246. That he was born of respectable parentage, and highly educated for the
profession of a rhetorician, is all that can be said with any degree of certainty. At his baptism
he assumed the name of his friend Cæcilius, and devoted himself, with all the energies of
an ardent and vigorous mind, to the study and practice of Christianity.</p>
<p>His ordination and his elevation to the episcopate rapidly followed his conversion. With
some resistance on his own part, and not without great objections on the part of older
presbyters, who saw themselves superseded by his promotion, the popular urgency constrained
him to accept the office of Bishop of Carthage (a.d. 248), which he held until his
martyrdom (a.d. 258).</p>
<p>The writings of Cyprian, apart from their intrinsic worth, have a very considerable historical
interest and value, as illustrating the social and religious feelings and usages that then
prevailed among the members of the Christian community. Nothing can enable us more
vividly to realize the intense convictions—the high-strained enthusiasm—which formed
the common level of the Christian experience, than does the indignation with which the
prelate denounces the evasions of those who dared not confess, or the lapses of those who
shrank from martyrdom. Living in the atmosphere of persecution, and often in the immediate
presence of a lingering death, the professors of Christianity were nerved up to a wonderful
contempt of suffering and of worldly enjoyment, and saw every event that occurred
around them in the glow of their excited imagination; so that many circumstances were
sincerely believed and honestly recorded, which will not be for a moment received as true
by the calm and critical reader. The account given by Cyprian in his treatise on the Lapsed2091
may serve as an illustration. Of this Dean Milman observes: “In what a high-wrought state
<note type="footnote">2091 P. 368, vol. i. Edin. edition.</note>

<pb n="671"/>
of enthusiasm must men have been, who could relate and believe such statements as miraculous!”
2092</p>
<p>Before being advanced to the episcopate, Cyprian had written his Epistle to Donatus
shortly after his baptism (a.d. 246); his treatise, or fragment of a treatise, on the Vanity of
Idols; and his three books of Testimonies against the Jews. In the following translation the
order of Migne has been adopted, which places the letter to Donatus, as seems most natural,
first among the Epistles, instead of with the Treatises.</p>
<p>The breaking out of the Decian persecution (a.d. 250) induced Cyprian to retire into
concealment for a time; and his retreat gave occasion to a sharp attack upon his conduct,
in a letter from the Roman to the Carthaginian clergy.2093 During this year he wrote many
letters from his place of concealment to the clergy and others at Rome and at Carthage,
controlling, warning, directing, and exhorting, and in every way maintaining his episcopal
superintendence in his absence, in all matters connected with the well-being of the Church.</p>
<p>The first 39 of the epistles, excepting the one to Donatus, were probably written during
the period of Cyprian’s retirement. He appears to have returned to his public duties early
in June, 251. Then follow many letters between himself and Cornelius bishop of Rome, and
others, on subjects connected with the schisms of Novatian, Novatus, and Felicissimus, and
with the condition of those who had been perverted by them. The question proposed in
Epistle 52 was settled in the Council that was held in May, 252; and the reference to that
anticipated decision limits the date of the letter to about April in the same year. In the 53d
Epistle, Cyprian is alluding to the impending persecution of Gallus, under which Cornelius
was banished in July, 252. The 56th Epistle was a letter of congratulation to Cornelius on
his banishment; and therefore it must have been written before September 14th in that year,
the date of the death of Cornelius. Lucius, his successor, was also banished, and was congratulated
on his return by Cyprian in Epistle 57, which therefore must have been written about
the end of November, 252. The 59th Epistle is referred by Bishop Pearson to the beginning
of the year 253.</p>
<p>There seems nothing to suggest the date of Epistles 60 and 61, except the probability
that they were written during a time of peace; and for this reason they are referred to the
beginning of Cyprian’s episcopate, before the outbreak of the Decian persecution, a.d. 249.
It is usual to assign Epistle 64 to the same year, or at least to a very early period of Cyprian’s
official life; but it seems scarcely likely that his episcopal counsel should have been sought
by a brother bishop in a matter of practice, until he had had some experience; and as it was
probably written at a time of peace, when discipline had become relaxed, the date 253 seems
preferable. The 68th Epistle is easily dated by the reference, on page 246, to an episcopate
<note type="footnote">2092 Milman’s History of Christianity, vol. ii. p. 190, note b. See note, p. 266.</note>
<note type="footnote">2093 Epistle ii.</note>

<pb n="672"/>
of six years’ duration; and it must therefore have been written in a.d. 254. On the 14th
September, Cyprian was banished to Curubis by the Emperor Valerian. From his place of
exile he wrote Epistle 76, which was replied to in Epistles 77, 78, and 79. Doubts are entertained
as to the date of Epistle 80, whether it should be referred to a.d. 250 or 257. Pamelius
prefers the latter date, on the ground that the Rogatianus to whom it is inscribed was one
who survived the Decian persecution, and a younger man than the one who, as he supposes,
was declared to have suffered martyrdom at the date of this Epistle.2094 This, however, seems
very unsatisfactory; and the weight of authority is in favour of the earlier date. The remaining
Epistles are easily limited by their contents to the period immediately preceding Cyprian’s
martyrdom.</p>
<p>For the sake of uniformity, it has been thought well to adhere to the arrangement of
Migne, in the order of the Epistles as well as in their divisions. For the convenience of reference,
however, the number of each Epistle in the Oxford edition is appended in a note. For
a similar reason, the general form of Migne’s text has been used in the following translation;
but the use of other texts and of preceding translations has not been rejected in the endeavour
to approximate to the sense of the author. Moreover, such various readings as might suggest
different shades of meaning in doubtful passages have been given.</p>
<p>The Translator has only to add, that, as a rule, an exact rendering has been sought after,
sometimes in preference to a version in fluent English. But, except in cases where the corruption
or obscurity of the text seems insurmountable, the meaning of the writer is believed
to be given fairly and intelligibly. The style of Cyprian, like that of his master Tertullian, is
marked much more by vehemence than perspicuity, and it is often no easy matter to give
exact expression in another language to the idea contained in the original text. Cyprian’s
Life, as written by his own deacon Pontius, is subjoined.</p>

<p>It is easy to speak with ridicule of such instances as Dean Milman here treats so philosophically.
But, lest believers should be charged with exceptional credulity, let us recall what
the father of English Deism relates of his own experiences, in the conclusion of his Autobiography:
“I had no sooner spoken these words (of prayer to the Deist’s deity) but a loud

<head>The Life and Passion
of
Cyprian, Bishop and Martyr.</head>
<p>By Pontius the Deacon.</p>
<p>1. Although Cyprian, the devout priest2096 and glorious witness of God, composed
many writings whereby the memory of his worthy name survives; and although the profuse
fertility of his eloquence and of God’s grace so expands itself in the exuberance and richness
of his discourse, that he will probably never cease to speak even to the end of the world; yet,
since to his works and deserts it is justly due that his example should be recorded in writing,
I have thought it well to prepare this brief and compendious narrative. Not that the life of
so great a man can be unknown to any even of the heathen nations, but that to our posterity
also this incomparable and lofty pattern may be prolonged into immortal remembrance. It
would assuredly be hard that, when our fathers have given such honour even to lay-people
and catechumens who have obtained martyrdom, for reverence of their very martyrdom,
as to record many, or I had nearly said, well nigh all, of the circumstances of their sufferings,
so that they might be brought to our knowledge also who as yet were not born, the passion
of such a priest and such a martyr as Cyprian should be passed over, who, independently
of his martyrdom, had much to teach, and that what he did while he lived should be hidden
from the world. And, indeed, these doings of his were such, and so great, and so admirable,
that I am deterred by the contemplation of their greatness, and confess myself incompetent
to discourse in a way that shall be worthy of the honour of his deserts, and unable to relate
such noble deeds in such a way that they may appear as great as in fact they are, except that
the multitude of his glories is itself sufficient for itself, and needs no other heraldry. It enhances
my difficulty, that you also are anxious to hear very much, or if it be possible every
thing, about him, longing with eager warmth at least to become acquainted with his deeds,
although now his living words are silent. And in this behalf, if I should say that the powers
of eloquence fail me, I should say too little. For eloquence itself fails of suitable powers fully
to satisfy your desire. And thus I am sorely pressed on both sides, since he burdens me with
his virtues, and you press me hard with your entreaties.</p>
<p>2. At what point, then, shall I begin,—from what direction shall I approach the description
of his goodness, except from the beginning of his faith and from his heavenly birth?
<note type="footnote">2096 [Here put for the chief in the sacerdocy. See p. 268, infra.]</note>

<pb n="675"/>
inasmuch as the doings of a man of God should not be reckoned from any point except
from the time that he was born of God. He may have had pursuits previously, and liberal
arts may have imbued his mind while engaged therein; but these things I pass over; for as
yet they had nothing to do with anything but his secular advantage. But when he had learned
sacred knowledge, and breaking through the clouds of this world had emerged into the light
of spiritual wisdom, if I was with him in any of his doings, if I have discerned any of his
more illustrious labours, I will speak of them; only asking meanwhile for this indulgence,
that whatever I shall say too little (for too little I must needs say) may rather be attributed
to my ignorance than subtracted from his glory. While his faith was in its first rudiments,
he believed that before God nothing was worthy in comparison of the observance of continency.
For he thought that the heart might then become what it ought to be, and the mind
attain to the full capacity of truth, if he trod under foot the lust of the flesh with the robust
and healthy vigour of holiness. Who has ever recorded such a marvel? His second birth had
not yet enlightened the new man with the entire splendour of the divine light, yet he was
already overcoming the ancient and pristine darkness by the mere dawning of the light.
Then—what is even greater—when he had learned from the reading of Scripture certain
things not according to the condition of his novitiate, but in proportion to the earliness of
his faith, he immediately laid hold of what he had discovered, for his own advantage in deserving
well of God.2097 By distributing his means for the relief of the indigence of the poor,
by dispensing the purchase-money of entire estates, he at once realized two benefits,—the
contempt of this world’s ambition, than which nothing is more pernicious, and the observance
of that mercy which God has preferred even to His sacrifices, and which even he did
not maintain who said that he had kept all the commandments of the law; whereby with
premature swiftness of piety he almost began to be perfect before he had learnt the way to
be perfect. Who of the ancients, I pray, has done this? Who of the most celebrated veterans
in the faith, whose hearts and ears have throbbed to the divine words for many years, has
attempted any such thing, as this man—of faith yet unskilled, and whom, perhaps, as yet
nobody trusted—surpassing the age of antiquity, accomplished by his glorious and admirable
labours? No one reaps immediately upon his sowing; no one presses out the vintage harvest
from the trenches just formed; no one ever yet sought for ripened fruit from newly planted
slips. But in him all incredible things concurred. In him the threshing preceded (if it may
be said, for the thing is beyond belief)—preceded the sowing, the vintage the shoots, the
fruit the root.</p>
<p>3. The apostle’s epistle says2098 that novices should be passed over, lest by the stupor
of heathenism that yet clings to their unconfirmed minds, their untaught inexperience
<note type="footnote">2097 [St. Luke xx. 35. Creature-merit is not implied, but, through grace, the desert of Matt. xxv. 21.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2098 1 Tim. iii. 6.</note>

<pb n="676"/>
should in any respect sin against God. He first, and I think he alone, furnished an illustration
that greater progress is made by faith than by time. For although in the Acts of the
Apostles2099 the eunuch is described as at once baptized by Philip, because he believed with
his whole heart, this is not a fair parallel. For he was a Jew,2100 and as he came from the
temple of the Lord he was reading the prophet Isaiah, and he hoped in Christ, although as
yet he did not believe that He had come; while the other, coming from the ignorant heathens,
began with a faith as mature as that with which few perhaps have finished their course. In
short, in respect of God’s grace, there was no delay, no postponement,—I have said but
little,—he immediately received the presbyterate and the priesthood.2101 For who is there
that would not entrust every grade of honour to one who believed with such a disposition?
There are many things which he did while still a layman, and many things which now as a
presbyter he did—many things which, after the examples of righteous men of old, and following
them with a close imitation, he accomplished with the obedience of entire consecration—
that deserved well of the Lord.2102 For his discourse concerning this was usually, that
if he had read of any one being set forth with the praise of God, he would persuade us to
inquire on account of what doings he had pleased God. If Job, glorious by God’s testimony,
was called a true worshipper of God, and one to whom there was none upon earth to be
compared, he taught that we should do whatever Job had previously done, so that while we
are doing like things we may call forth a similar testimony of God for ourselves. He, contemning
the loss of his estate, gained such advantage by his virtue thus tried, that he had no
perception of the temporal losses even of his affection. Neither poverty nor pain broke him
down; the persuasion of his wife did not influence him; the dreadful suffering of his own
body did not shake his firmness. His virtue remained established in its own home, and his
devotion, founded upon deep roots, gave way under no onset of the devil tempting him to
abstain from blessing his God with a grateful faith even in his adversity. His house was open
to every comer. No widow returned from him with an empty lap; no blind man was unguided
by him as a companion; none faltering in step was unsupported by him for a staff; none
stripped of help by the hand of the mighty was not protected by him as a defender. Such
things ought they to do, he was accustomed to say, who desire to please God. And thus
running through the examples of all good men, by always imitating those who were better
than others he made himself also worthy of imitation.</p>
<p>4. He had a close association among us with a just man, and of praiseworthy memory,
by name Cæcilius, and in age as well as in honour a presbyter, who had converted him from

<note type="footnote">2102 [See above note 1, this page.]</note>

<pb n="677"/>
his worldly errors to the acknowledgment of the true divinity. This man he loved with entire
honour and all observance, regarding him with an obedient veneration, not only as the
friend and comrade of his soul, but as the parent of his new life. And at length he, influenced
by his attentions, was, as well he might be, stimulated to such a pitch of excessive love, that
when he was departing from this world, and his summons was at hand, he commended to
him his wife and children; so that him whom he had made a partner in the fellowship of his
way of life, he afterwards made the heir of his affection.</p>
<p>5. It would be tedious to go through individual circumstances, it would be laborious to
enumerate all his doings. For the proof of his good works I think that this one thing is
enough, that by the judgment of God and the favour of the people, he was chosen to the
office of the priesthood and the degree of the episcopate while still a neophyte, and, as it
was considered, a novice. Although still in the early days of his faith, and in the untaught
season of his spiritual life, a generous disposition so shone forth in him, that although not
yet resplendent with the glitter of office, but only of hope, he gave promise of entire trustworthiness
for the priesthood that was coming upon him. Moreover, I will not pass over
that remarkable fact, of the way in which, when the entire people by God’s inspiration leapt
forward in his love and honour, he humbly withdrew, giving place to men of older standing,
and thinking himself unworthy of a claim to so great honour, so that he thus became more
worthy. For he is made more worthy who dispenses with what he deserves. And with this
excitement were the eager people at that time inflamed, desiring with a spiritual longing, as
the event proved, not only a bishop,—for in him whom then with a latent foreboding of
divinity they were in such wise demanding, they were seeking not only a priest,—but
moreover a future martyr. A crowded fraternity was besieging the doors of the house, and
throughout all the avenues of access an anxious love was circulating. Possibly that
apostolic experience might then have happened to him, as he desired, of being let down
through a window, had he also been equal to the apostle in the honour of ordination.2103
It was plain to be seen that all the rest were expecting his coming with an anxious spirit of
suspense, and received him when he came with excessive joy. I speak unwillingly, but I must
needs speak. Some resisted him, even that he might overcome them; yet with what gentleness,
how patiently, how benevolently he gave them indulgence! how mercifully he forgave them,
reckoning them afterwards, to the astonishment of many, among his closest and, most intimate
friends! For who would not be amazed at the forgetfulness of a mind so retentive?</p>
<p>6. Henceforth who is sufficient to relate the manner in which he bore himself?—what
pity was his? what vigour? how great his mercy? how great his strictness? So much sanctity
and grace beamed from his face that it confounded the minds of the beholders. His countenance
was grave and joyous. Neither was his severity gloomy, nor his affability excessive,
<note type="footnote">2103 [The charismata of a higher ministry.]</note>

<pb n="678"/>
but a mingled tempering of both; so that it might be doubted whether he most deserved to
be revered or to be loved, except that he deserved both to be revered and to be loved. And
his dress was not out of harmony with his countenance, being itself also subdued to a fitting
mean. The pride of the world did not inflame him, nor yet did an excessively affected penury
make him sordid, because this latter kind of attire arises no less from boastfulness, than
does such an ambitious frugality from ostentation. But what did he as bishop in respect of
the poor, whom as a catechumen he had loved? Let the priests of piety consider, or those
whom the teaching of their very rank has trained to the duty of good works, or those whom
the common obligation of the Sacrament has bound to the duty of manifesting love. Cyprian
the bishop’s cathedra received such as he had been before,—it did not make him so.2104</p>
<p>7. And therefore for such merits he at once obtained the glory of proscription also. For
nothing else was proper than that he who in the secret recesses of his conscience was rich
in the full honour of religion and faith, should moreover be renowned in the publicly diffused
report of the Gentiles. He might, indeed, at that time, in accordance with the rapidity
wherewith he always attained everything, have hastened to the crown of martyrdom appointed
for him, especially when with repeated calls he was frequently demanded for the lions,
had it not been needful for him to pass through all the grades of glory, and thus to arrive at
the highest, and had not the impending desolation needed the aid of so fertile a mind. For
conceive of him as being at that time taken away by the dignity of martyrdom. Who was
there to show the advantage of grace, advancing by faith? Who was there to restrain virgins
to the fitting discipline of modesty and a dress worthy of holiness, as if with a kind of bridle
of the lessons of the Lord? Who was there to teach penitence to the lapsed, truth to heretics,
unity to schismatics, peacefulness and the law of evangelical prayer to the sons of God? By
whom were the blaspheming Gentiles to be overcome by retorting upon themselves the accusations
which they heap upon us? By whom were Christians of too tender an affection,
or, what is of more importance, of a too feeble faith in respect of the loss of their friends, to
be consoled with the hope of futurity? Whence should we so learn mercy? whence patience?
Who was there to restrain the ill blood arising from the envenomed malignity of envy, with
the sweetness of a wholesome remedy? Who was there to raise up such great martyrs by the
exhortation of his divine discourse? Who was there, in short, to animate so many confessors
sealed with a second inscription on their distinguished brows, and reserved alive for an example
of martyrdom, kindling their ardour with a heavenly trumpet? Fortunately, fortunately
it occurred then, and truly by the Spirit’s direction, that the man who was needed for so
many and so excellent purposes was withheld from the consummation of martyrdom. Do
you wish to be assured that the cause of his withdrawal was not fear? to allege nothing else,
he did suffer subsequently, and this suffering he assuredly would have evaded as usual, if
<note type="footnote">2104 [Nor does it make any one so. But the Fathers seem to have thought it made good men more humble.]</note>

<pb n="679"/>
he had evaded it before. It was indeed that fear—and rightly so—that fear which would
dread to offend the Lord—that fear which prefers to obey God’s commands rather than to
be crowned in disobedience. For a mind dedicated in all things to God, and thus enslaved
to the divine admonitions, believed that even in suffering itself it would sin, unless it had
obeyed the Lord, who then bade him seek the place of concealment.</p>
<p>8. Moreover, I think that something may here be said about the benefit of the delay, although
I have already touched slightly on the matter. By what appears subsequently to have
occurred, it follows that we may prove that that withdrawal was not conceived by human
pusillanimity, but, as indeed is the case, was truly divine. The unusual and violent rage of a
cruel persecution had laid waste God’s people; and since the artful enemy could not deceive
all by one fraud, wherever the incautious soldier laid bare his side, there in various manifestations
of rage he had destroyed individuals with different kinds of overthrow. There needed
some one who could, when men were wounded and hurt by the various arts of the attacking
enemy, use the remedy of the celestial medicine according to the nature of the wound, either
for cutting or for cherishing them. Thus was preserved a man of an intelligence, besides
other excellences, also spiritually trained, who between the resounding waves of the opposing
schisms could steer the middle course of the Church in a steady path. Are not such plans,
I ask, divine? Could this have been done without God? Let them consider who think that
such things as these can happen by chance. To them the Church replies with clear voice,
saying, “I do not allow and do not believe that such needful then are reserved without the
decree of God.”</p>
<p>9. Still, if it seem well, let me glance at the rest. Afterwards there broke out a dreadful
plague, and excessive destruction of a hateful disease invaded every house in succession of
the trembling populace, carrying off day by day with abrupt attack numberless people, every
one from his own house. All were shuddering, fleeing, shunning the contagion, impiously
exposing their own friends, as if with the exclusion of the person who was sure to die of the
plague, one could exclude death itself also. There lay about the meanwhile, over the whole
city, no longer bodies, but the carcases of many, and, by the contemplation of a lot which
in their turn would be theirs, demanded the pity of the passers-by for themselves. No one
regarded anything besides his cruel gains. No one trembled at the remembrance of a similar
event. No one did to another what he himself wished to experience. In these circumstances,
it would be a wrong to pass over what the pontiff2105 of Christ did, who excelled the pontiffs
of the world as much in kindly affection as he did in truth of religion. On the people assembled
together in one place he first of all urged the benefits of mercy, teaching by examples
from divine lessons, how greatly the duties of benevolence avail to deserve well of God.
<note type="footnote">2105 [This heathen word thus comes into use as applicable to all bishops. It was used derisively by Tertullian,
vol. iv. p. 74.]</note>

<pb n="680"/>
Then afterwards he subjoined, that there was nothing wonderful in our cherishing our own
people only with the needed attentions of love, but that he might become perfect who would
do something more than the publican or the heathen, who, overcoming evil with good, and
practising a clemency which was like the divine clemency, loved even his enemies, who
would pray for the salvation of those that persecute him, as the Lord admonishes and exhorts.
God continually makes His sun to rise, and from time to time gives showers to nourish the
seed, exhibiting all these kindnesses not only to His people, but to aliens also. And if a man
professes to be a son of God, why does not he imitate the example of his Father? “It becomes
us,” said he, “to answer to our birth; and it is not fitting that those who are evidently born
of God should be degenerate, but rather that the propagation of a good Father should be
proved in His offspring by the emulation of His goodness.”</p>
<p>10. I omit many other matters, and, indeed, many important ones, which the necessity
of a limited space does not permit to be detailed in more lengthened discourse, and concerning
which this much is sufficient to have been said. But if the Gentiles could have heard
these things as they stood before the rostrum, they would probably at once have believed.
What, then, should a Christian people do, whose very name proceeds from faith? Thus the
ministrations are constantly distributed according to the quality of the men and their degrees.
Many who, by the straitness of poverty, were unable to manifest the kindness of wealth,
manifested more than wealth, making up by their own labour a service dearer than all riches.
And under such a teacher, who would not press forward to be found in some part of such
a warfare, whereby he might please both God the Father, and Christ the Judge, and for the
present so excellent a priest? Thus what is good was done in the liberality of overflowing
works to all men, not to those only who are of the household of faith. Something more was
done than is recorded of the incomparable benevolence of Tobias. He must forgive, and
forgive again, and frequently forgive; or, to speak more truly, he must of right concede that,
although very much might be done before Christ, yet that something more might be done
after Christ, since to His times all fulness is attributed. Tobias collected together those who
were slain by the king and cast out, of his own race only.</p>
<p>11. Banishment followed these actions, so good and so benevolent. For impiety always
makes this return, that it repays the better with the worse. And what God’s priest replied to
the interrogation of the proconsul, there are Acts which relate. In the meantime, he is excluded
from the city who had done some good for the city’s safety; he who had striven that
the eyes of the living should not suffer the horrors of the infernal abode; he, I say, who, vigilant
in the watches of benevolence, had provided—oh wickedness! with unacknowledged
goodness—that when all were forsaking the desolate appearance of the city, a destitute state
and a deserted country should not perceive its many exiles. But let the world look to this,
which accounts banishment a penalty. To them, their country is too dear, and they have the
same name as their parents; but we abhor even our parents themselves if they would persuade

<pb n="681"/>
us against God. To them, it is a severe punishment to live outside their own city; to the
Christian, the whole of this world is one home. Wherefore, though he were banished into
a hidden and secret place, yet, associated with the affairs of his God, he cannot regard it as
an exile. In addition, while honestly serving God, he is a stranger even in his own city. For
while the continency of the Holy Spirit restrains him from carnal desires, he lays aside the
conversation of the former man, and even among his fellow-citizens, or, I might almost say,
among the parents themselves of his earthly life, he is a stranger. Besides, although this
might otherwise appear to be a punishment, yet in causes and sentences of this kind, which
we suffer for the trial of the proof of our virtue, it is not a punishment, because it is a glory.
But, indeed, suppose banishment not to be a punishment to us, yet the witness of their own
conscience may still attribute the last and worst wickedness to those who can lay upon the
innocent what they think to be a punishment. I will not now describe a charming place;
and, for the present, I pass over the addition of all possible delights. Let us conceive of the
place, filthy in situation, squalid in appearance, having no wholesome water, no pleasantness
of verdure, no neighbouring shore, but vast wooded rocks between the inhospitable jaws of
a totally deserted solitude, far removed in the pathless regions of the world. Such a place
might have borne the name of exile, if Cyprian, the priest of God, had come thither; although
to him, if the ministrations of men had been wanting, either birds, as in the case of Elias, or
angels, as in that of Daniel, would have ministered. Away, away with the belief that anything
would be wanting to the least of us, so long as he stands for the confession of the name. So
far was God’s pontiff, who had always been urgent in merciful works, from needing the assistance
of all these things.</p>
<p>12. And now let us return with thankfulness to what I had suggested in the second place,
that for the soul of such a man there was divinely provided a sunny and suitable spot, a
dwelling, secret as he wished, and all that has before been promised to be added to those
who seek the kingdom and righteousness of God. And, not to mention the number of the
brethren who visited him, and then the kindness of the citizens themselves, which supplied
to him everything whereof he appeared to be deprived, I will not pass over God’s wonderful
visitation, whereby He wished His priest in exile to be so certain of his passion that was to
follow, that in his full confidence of the threatening martyrdom, Curubis possessed not only
an exile, but a martyr too. For on that day whereon we first abode in the place of banishment
(for the condescension of his love had chosen me among his household companions to a
voluntary exile: would that he could also have chosen me to share his passion!),2106 “there
appeared to me,” said he, “ere yet I was sunk in the repose of slumber, a young man of unusual
stature, who, as it were, led me to the prætorium, where I seemed to myself to be led
before the tribunal of the proconsul, then sitting. When he looked upon me, he began at
<note type="footnote">2106 [Pontius is said to have followed his beloved bishop, a.d. 258, dying a martyr.]</note>

<pb n="682"/>
once to note down a sentence on his tablet, which I knew not, for he had asked nothing of
me with the accustomed interrogation. But the youth, who was standing at his back, very
anxiously read what had been noted down. And because he could not then declare it in
words, he showed me by an intelligible sign what was contained in the writing of that tablet.
For, with hand expanded and flattened like a blade, he imitated the stroke of the accustomed
punishment, and expressed what he wished to be understood as clearly as by speech,—I
understood the future sentence of my passion. I began to ask and to beg immediately that
a delay of at least one day should be accorded me, until I should have arranged my property
in some reasonable order. And when I had urgently repeated my entreaty, he began again
to note down, I know not what, on his tablet. But I perceived from the calmness of his
countenance that the judge’s mind was moved by my petition, as being a just one. Moreover,
that youth, who already had disclosed to me the intelligence of my passion by gesture rather
than by words, hastened to signify repeatedly by secret signal that the delay was granted
which had been asked for until the morrow, twisting his fingers one behind the other. And
I, although the sentence had not been read, although I rejoiced with very glad heart with
joy at the delay accorded, yet trembled so with fear of the uncertainty of the interpretation,
that the remains of fear still set my exulting heart beating with excessive agitation.”</p>
<p>13. What could be more plain than this revelation? What could be more blessed than
this condescension? Everything was foretold to him beforehand which subsequently followed.
Nothing was diminished of the words of God, nothing was mutilated of so sacred a promise.
Carefully consider each particular in accordance with its announcement. He asks for delay
till the morrow, when the sentence of his passion was under deliberation, begging that he
might arrange his affairs on the day which he had thus obtained. This one day signified a
year, which he was about to pass in the world after his vision. For, to speak more plainly,
after the year was expired, he was crowned, on that day on which, at the commencement
of the year, the fact had been announced to him. For although we do not read of the day of
the Lord as a year in sacred Scripture, yet we regard that space of time as due in making
promise of future things.2107 Whence is it of no consequence if, in this case, under the ordinary
expression of a day, it is only a year that in this place is implied, because that which
is the greater ought to be fuller in meaning. Moreover, that it was explained rather by signs
than by speech, was because the utterance of speech was reserved for the manifestation of
the time itself. For anything is usually set forth in words, whenever what is set forth is accomplished.
For, indeed, no one knew why this had been shown to him, until afterwards,
when, on the very day on which he had seen it, he was crowned. Nevertheless, in the
meantime, his impending suffering was certainly known by all, but the exact day of his
passion was not spoken of by any of the same, just as if they were ignorant of it. And, indeed,
<note type="footnote">2107 [See Origen, “weeks of years,” vol. iv. p. 353.]</note>

<pb n="683"/>
I find something similar in the Scriptures. For Zacharias the priest, because he did not believe
the promise of a son, made to him by the angel, became dumb; so that he asked for tablets
by a sign, being about to write his son’s name rather than utter it. With reason, also in this
case, where God’s messenger declared the impending passion of His priest rather by signs,
he both admonished his faith and fortified His priest. Moreover, the ground of asking for
delay arose out of his wish to arrange his affairs and settle his will. Yet what affairs or what
will had he to arrange, except ecclesiastical concerns? And thus that last delay was received,
in order that whatever had to be disposed of by his final decision concerning the care of
cherishing the poor might be arranged. And I think that for no other reason, and indeed
for this reason only, indulgence was granted to him even by those very persons who had
ejected and were about to slay him, that, being at hand, he might relieve the poor also who
were before him with the final or, to speak more accurately, with the entire outlay of his last
stewardship. And therefore, having so benevolently ordered matters, and so arranged them
according to his will, the morrow drew near.</p>
<p>14. Now also a messenger came to him from the city from Xistus, the good and peacemaking
priest, and on that account most blessed martyr. The coming executioner was instantly
looked for who should strike through that devoted neck of the most sacred victim;
and thus, in the daily expectation of dying, every day was to him as if the crown might be
attributed to each. In the meantime, there assembled to him many eminent people, and
people of most illustrious rank and family, and noble with the world’s distinctions, who, on
account of ancient friendship with him, repeatedly urged his withdrawal; and, that their
urgency might not be in some sort hollow, they also offered places to which he might retire.
But he had now set the world aside, having his mind suspended upon heaven, and did not
consent to their tempting persuasions. He would perhaps even then have done what was
asked for by so many and faithful friends, if it had been bidden him by divine command.
But that lofty glory of so great a man must not be passed over without announcement, that
now, when the world was swelling, and of its trust in its princes breathing out hatred of the
name, he was instructing God’s servants, as opportunity was given, in the exhortations of
the Lord, and was animating them to tread under foot the sufferings of this present time by
the contemplation of a glory to come hereafter. Indeed, such was his love of sacred discourse,
that he wished that his prayers in regard to his suffering might be so answered, that he would
be put to death in the very act of speaking about God.</p>
<p>15. And these were the daily acts of a priest destined for a pleasing sacrifice to God,
when, behold, at the bidding of the proconsul, the officer with his soldiers on a sudden came
unexpectedly on him,—or rather, to speak more truly, thought that he had come unexpectedly
on him, at his gardens,—at his gardens, I say, which at the beginning of his faith he had
sold, and which, being restored by God’s mercy, he would assuredly have sold again for the
use of the poor, if he had not wished to avoid ill-will from the persecutors. But when could

<pb n="684"/>
a mind ever prepared be taken unawares, as if by an unforeseen attack? Therefore now he
went forward, certain that what had been long delayed would be settled. He went forward
with a lofty and elevated mien, manifesting cheerfulness in his look and courage in his heart.
But being delayed to the morrow, he returned from the prætorium to the officer’s house,
when on a sudden a scattered rumour prevailed throughout all Carthage, that now Thascius
was brought forward, whom there was nobody who did not know as well for his illustrious
fame in the honourable opinion of all, as on account of the recollection of his most renowned
work. On all sides all men were flocking together to a spectacle, to us glorious from the devotion
of faith, and to be mourned over even by the Gentiles. A gentle custody, however,
had him in charge when taken and placed for one night in the officer’s house; so that we,
his associates and friends, were as usual in his company. The whole people in the meantime,
in anxiety that nothing should be done throughout the night without their knowledge, kept
watch before the officer’s door. The goodness of God granted him at that time, so truly
worthy of it, that even God’s people should watch on the passion of the priest. Yet, perhaps,
some one may ask what was the reason of his returning from the prætorium to the officer.
And some think that this arose from the fact, that for his own part the proconsul was then
unwilling. Far be it from me to complain, in matters divinely ordered, of slothfulness or
aversion in the proconsul. Far be it from me to admit such an evil into the consciousness
of a religious mind, as that the fancy of man should decide the fate of so blessed a martyr.
But the morrow, which a year before the divine condescension had foretold, required to be
literally the morrow.2108</p>
<p>16. At last that other day dawned—that destined, that promised, that divine day—which,
if even the tyrant himself had wished to put off, he would not have had any power to do so;
the day rejoicing at the consciousness of the future martyr; and, the clouds being scattered
throughout the circuit of the world, the day shone upon them with a brilliant sun. He went
out from the house of the officer, though he was the officer of Christ and God, and was
walled in on all sides by the ranks of a mingled multitude. And such a numberless army
hung upon his company, as if they had come with an assembled troop to assault death itself.
Now, as he went, he had to pass by the race-course. And rightly, and as if it had been contrived
on purpose, he had to pass by the place of a corresponding struggle, who, having
finished his contest, was running to the crown of righteousness. But when he had come to
the prætorium, as the proconsul had not yet come forth, a place of retirement was accorded
him. There, as he sat moistened after his long journey with excessive perspiration (the seat
was by chance covered with linen, so that even in the very moment of his passion he might
enjoy the honour of the episcopate),2109 one of the officers (“Tesserarius”), who had formerly
<note type="footnote">2108 That is, Providence ensured the respite, to fulfil the promise.</note>
<note type="footnote">2109 [See note at end of this memoir.]</note>

<pb n="685"/>
been a Christian, offered him his clothes, as if he might wish to change his moistened garments
for drier ones; and he doubtless coveted nothing further in respect of his proffered
kindness than to possess the now blood-stained sweat of the martyr going to God. He made
reply to him, and said, “We apply medicines to annoyances which probably to-day will no
longer exist.” Is it any wonder that he despised suffering in body who had despised death
in soul? Why should we say more? He was suddenly announced to the proconsul; he is
brought forward; he is placed before him; he is interrogated as to his name. He answers who
he is, and nothing more.</p>
<p>17. And thus, therefore, the judge reads from his tablet the sentence which lately in the
vision he had not read,—a spiritual sentence, not rashly to be spoken,—a sentence worthy
of such a bishop and such a witness; a glorious sentence, wherein he was called a standardbearer
of the sect, and an enemy of the gods, and one who was to be an example to his people;
and that with his blood discipline would begin to be established. Nothing could be more
complete, nothing more true, than this sentence. For all the things which were said, although
said by a heathen, are divine. Nor is it indeed to be wondered at, since priests are accustomed
to prophesy of the passion. He had been a standard-bearer, who was accustomed to teach
concerning the bearing of Christ’s standard; he had been an enemy of the gods, who commanded
the idols to be destroyed. Moreover, he gave example to his friends, since, when
many were about to follow in a similar manner, he was the first in the province to consecrate
the first-fruits of martyrdom. And by his blood discipline began to be established; but it was
the discipline of martyrs, who, emulating their teacher, in the imitation of a glory like his
own, themselves also gave a confirmation to discipline by the very blood of their own example.</p>
<p>18. And when he left the doors of the prætorium, a crowd of soldiery accompanied him;
and that nothing might be wanting in his passion, centurions and tribunes guarded his side.
Now the place itself where he was about to suffer is level, so that it affords a noble spectacle,
with its trees thickly planted on all sides. But as, by the extent of the space beyond, the view
was not attainable to the confused crowd, persons who favoured him had climbed up into
the branches of the trees, that there might not even be wanting to him (what happened in
the case of Zacchæus), that he was gazed upon from the trees. And now, having with his
own hands bound his eyes, he tried to hasten the slowness of the executioner, whose office
was to wield the sword, and who with difficulty clasped the blade in his failing right hand
with trembling fingers, until the mature hour of glorification strengthened the hand of the
centurion with power granted from above to accomplish the death of the excellent man,
and at length supplied him with the permitted strength. O blessed people of the Church,
who as well in sight as in feeling, and, what is more, in outspoken words, suffered with such
a bishop as theirs; and, as they had ever heard him in his own discourses, were crowned by
God the Judge! For although that which the general wish desired could not occur, viz., that

<pb n="686"/>
the entire congregation should suffer at once in the fellowship of a like glory, yet whoever
under the eyes of Christ beholding, and in the hearing of the priest, eagerly desired to suffer,
by the sufficient testimony of that desire did in some sort send a missive to God, as his ambassador.</p>
<p>19. His passion being thus accomplished, it resulted that Cyprian, who had been an example
to all good men, was also the first who in Africa imbued his priestly crown2110 with
blood of martyrdom, because he was the first who began to be such after the apostles. For
from the time at which the episcopal order is enumerated at Carthage, not one is ever recorded,
even of good men and priests, to have come to suffering. Although devotion surrendered
to God is always in consecrated men reckoned instead of martyrdom; yet Cyprian attained
even to the perfect crown by the consummation of the Lord; so that in that very city in which
he had in such wise lived, and in which he had been the first to do many noble deeds, he
also was the first to decorate the insignia2111 of his heavenly priesthood with glorious gore.
What shall I do now? Between joy at his passion, and grief at still remaining, my mind is
divided in different directions, and twofold affections are burdening a heart too limited for
them. Shall I grieve that I was not his associate? But yet I must triumph in his victory. Shall
I triumph at his victory? Still I grieve that I am not his companion. Yet still to you I must
in simplicity confess, what you also are aware of, that it was my intention to be his companion.
Much and excessively I exult at his glory; but still more do I grieve that I remained behind.</p>

<p>To Donatus.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Had Promised Donatus that He Would Have a Discourse with
Him Concerning Things Divine, and Now Being Reminded of His Promise, He
Fulfils It. Commending at Length the Grace of God Conferred in Baptism, He
Declares How He Had Been Changed Thereby; And, Finally, Pointing Out the
Errors of the World, He Exhorts to Contempt of It and to Reading and Prayer.</p>
<p>1. Cæcilius Cyprian to Donatus sends, greeting. You rightly remind me, dearest Donatus
for I not only remember my promise, but I confess that this is the appropriate time for its
fulfilment, when the vintage festival invites the mind to unbend in repose, and to enjoy the
annual and appointed respite of the declining year.2113 Moreover, the place is in accord
with the season, and the pleasant aspect of the gardens harmonizes with the gentle breezes
of a mild autumn in soothing and cheering the senses. In such a place as this it is delightful
to pass the day in discourse, and, by the (study of the sacred) parables,2114 to train the
conscience of the breast to the apprehension of the divine precepts. And that no profane
intruder may interrupt our converse, nor any unrestrained clatter of a noisy household
disturb it, let us seek this bower.2115 The neighbouring thickets ensure us solitude, and the
vagrant trailings of the vine branches creeping in pendent mazes among the reeds that
support them have made for us a porch of vines and a leafy shelter. Pleasantly here we clothe
our thoughts in words; and while we gratify our eyes with the agreeable outlook upon trees
and vines, the mind is at once instructed by what we hear, and nourished by what we see,
although at the present time your only pleasure and your only interest is in our discourse.
Despising the pleasures of sight, your eye is now fixed on me. With your mind as well as
your ears you are altogether a listener; and a listener, too, with an eagerness proportioned
to your affection.</p>

<p>2. And yet, of what kind or of what amount is anything that my mind is likely to communicate
to yours? The poor mediocrity of my shallow understanding produces a very
limited harvest, and enriches the soil with no fruitful deposits. Nevertheless, with such
powers as I have, I will set about the matter; for the subject itself on which I am about to
speak will assist me. In courts of justice, in the public assembly, in political debate, a copious
eloquence may be the glory of a voluble ambition; but in speaking of the Lord God, a chaste
simplicity of expression strives for the conviction of faith rather with the substance, than
with the powers, of eloquence. Therefore accept from me things, not clever but weighty,
words, not decked up to charm a popular audience with cultivated rhetoric, but simple and
fitted by their unvarnished truthfulness for the proclamation of the divine mercy. Accept
what is felt before it is spoken, what has not been accumulated with tardy painstaking during
the lapse of years, but has been inhaled in one breath of ripening grace.</p>
<p>3. While I was still lying in darkness and gloomy night, wavering hither and thither,
tossed about on the foam of this boastful age, and uncertain of my wandering steps, knowing
nothing of my real life, and remote from truth and light, I used to regard it as a difficult
matter, and especially as difficult in respect of my character at that time, that a man should
be capable of being born again2116—a truth which the divine mercy had announced for my
salvation,—and that a man quickened to a new life in the laver of saving water should be
able to put off what he had previously been; and, although retaining all his bodily structure,
should be himself changed in heart and soul. “How,” said I, “is such a conversion possible,
that there should be a sudden and rapid divestment of all which, either innate in us has
hardened in the corruption of our material nature, or acquired by us has become inveterate
by long accustomed use? These things have become deeply and radically engrained within
us. When does he learn thrift who has been used to liberal banquets and sumptuous feasts?
And he who has been glittering in gold and purple, and has been celebrated for his costly
attire, when does he reduce himself to ordinary and simple clothing? One who has felt the
charm of the fasces and of civic honours shrinks from becoming a mere private and inglorious
citizen. The man who is attended by crowds of clients, and dignified by the numerous association
of an officious train, regards it as a punishment when he is alone. It is inevitable, as
it ever has been, that the love of wine should entice, pride inflate, anger inflame, covetousness
disquiet, cruelty stimulate, ambition delight, lust hasten to ruin, with allurements that will
not let go their hold.”</p>
<p>4. These were my frequent thoughts. For as I myself was held in bonds by the innumerable
errors of my previous life, from which I did not believe that I could by possibility be
delivered, so I was disposed to acquiesce in my clinging vices; and because I despaired of
better things, I used to indulge my sins as if they were actually parts of me, and indigenous
<note type="footnote">2116 [Another Nicodemus, John iii.]</note>

<pb n="689"/>
to me. But after that, by the help of the water of new birth, the stain of former years had
been washed away, and a light from above, serene and pure, had been infused into my reconciled
heart,—after that, by the agency of the Spirit breathed from heaven, a second birth
had restored me to a new man;—then, in a wondrous manner, doubtful things at once began
to assure themselves to me, hidden things to be revealed, dark things to be enlightened,
what before had seemed difficult began to suggest a means of accomplishment, what had
been thought impossible, to be capable of being achieved; so that I was enabled to acknowledge
that what previously, being born of the flesh, had been living in the practice of sins,
was of the earth earthly, but had now begun to be of God, and was animated by the Spirit
of holiness. You yourself assuredly know and recollect as well as I do what was taken away
from us, and what was given to us by that death of evil, and that life of virtue. You yourself
know this without my information. Anything like boasting in one’s own praise is hateful,
although we cannot in reality boast but only be grateful for whatever we do not ascribe to
man’s virtue but declare to be the gift of God; so that now we sin not is the beginning of the
work of faith, whereas that we sinned before was the result of human error. All our power
is of God; I say, of God. From Him we have life, from Him we have strength, by power derived
and conceived from Him we do, while yet in this world, foreknow the indications of things
to come. Only let fear be the keeper of innocence, that the Lord, who of His mercy has
flowed2117 into our hearts in the access of celestial grace, may be kept by righteous submissiveness
in the hostelry of a grateful mind, that the assurance we have gained may not
beget carelessness, and so the old enemy creep upon us again.</p>
<p>5. But if you keep the way of innocence, the way of righteousness, if you walk with a
firm and steady step, if, depending on God with your whole strength and with your whole
heart, you only be what you have begun to be, liberty and power to do is given you in proportion
to the increase of your spiritual grace. For there is not, as is the case with earthly
benefits, any measure or stint in the dispensing of the heavenly gift. The Spirit freely flowing
forth is restrained by no limits, is checked by no closed barriers within certain bounded
spaces; it flows perpetually, it is exuberant in its affluence. Let our heart only be athirst, and
be ready to receive: in the degree in which we bring to it a capacious faith, in that measure
we draw from it an overflowing grace. Thence is given power, with modest chastity, with a
sound mind, with a simple voice, with unblemished virtue, that is able to quench the virus
of poisons for the healing of the sick, to purge out the stains of foolish souls by restored
health, to bid peace to those that are at enmity, repose to the violent, gentleness to the unruly,—
by startling threats to force to avow themselves the impure and vagrant spirits that
have betaken themselves into the bodies of men whom they purpose to destroy, to drive
them with heavy blows to come out of them, to stretch them out struggling, howling,
<note type="footnote">2117 Or, “shone,” “infulsit.”</note>

<pb n="690"/>
groaning with increase of constantly renewing pain, to beat them with scourges, to roast
them with fire: the matter is carried on there, but is not seen; the strokes inflicted are hidden,
but the penalty is manifest. Thus, in respect of what we have already begun to be, the Spirit
that we have received possesses its own liberty of action; while in that we have not yet
changed our body and members, the carnal view is still darkened by the clouds of this world.
How great is this empire of the mind, and what a power it has, not alone that itself is withdrawn
from the mischievous associations of the world, as one who is purged and pure can
suffer no stain of a hostile irruption, but that it becomes still greater and stronger in its
might, so that it can rule over all the imperious host of the attacking adversary with its sway!</p>
<p>6. But in order that the characteristics of the divine may shine more brightly by the development
of the truth, I will give you light to apprehend it, the obscurity caused by sin being
wiped away. I will draw away the veil from the darkness of this hidden world. For a brief
space conceive yourself to be transported to one of the loftiest peaks of some inaccessible
mountain, thence gaze on the appearances of things lying below you, and with eyes turned
in various directions look upon the eddies of the billowy world, while you yourself are removed
from earthly contacts,—you will at once begin to feel compassion for the world, and
with self-recollection and increasing gratitude to God, you will rejoice with all the greater
joy that you have escaped it. Consider the roads blocked up by robbers, the seas beset with
pirates, wars scattered all over the earth with the bloody horror of camps. The whole world
is wet with mutual blood; and murder, which in the case of an individual is admitted to be
a crime, is called a virtue when it is committed wholesale. Impunity is claimed for the wicked
deeds, not on the plea that they are guiltless, but because the cruelty is perpetrated on a
grand scale.</p>
<p>7. And now, if you turn your eyes and your regards to the cities themselves, you will
behold a concourse more fraught with sadness than any solitude. The gladiatorial games
are prepared, that blood may gladden the lust of cruel eyes. The body is fed up with stronger
food, and the vigorous mass of limbs is enriched with brawn and muscle, that the wretch
fattened for punishment may die a harder death. Man is slaughtered that man may be gratified,
and the skill that is best able to kill is an exercise and an art. Crime is not only committed,
but it is taught. What can be said more inhuman,—what more repulsive? Training
is undergone to acquire the power to murder, and the achievement of murder is its glory.
What state of things, I pray you, can that be, and what can it be like, in which men, whom
none have condemned, offer themselves to the wild beasts—men of ripe age, of sufficiently
beautiful person, clad in costly garments? Living men, they are adorned for a voluntary
death; wretched men, they boast of their own miseries. They fight with beasts, not for their
crime, but for their madness. Fathers look on their own sons; a brother is in the arena, and
his sister is hard by; and although a grander display of pomp increases the price of the exhibition,
yet, oh shame! even the mother will pay the increase in order that she may be

<pb n="691"/>
present at her own miseries. And in looking upon scenes so frightful and so impious and
so deadly, they do not seem to be aware that they are parricides with their eyes.</p>
<p>8. Hence turn your looks to the abominations, not less to be deplored, of another kind
of spectacle.2118 In the theatres also you will behold what may well cause you grief and
shame. It is the tragic buskin which relates in verse the crimes of ancient days. The old
horrors2119 of parricide and incest are unfolded in action calculated to express the image
of the truth, so that, as the ages pass by, any crime that was formerly committed may not
be forgotten. Each generation is reminded by what it hears, that whatever has once been
done may be done again. Crimes never die out by the lapse of ages; wickedness is never abolished
by process of time; impiety is never buried in oblivion. Things which have now
ceased to be actual deeds of vice become examples. In the mimes, moreover, by the teaching
of infamies, the spectator is attracted either to reconsider what he may have done in secret,
or to hear what he may do. Adultery is learnt while it is seen; and while the mischief having
public authority panders to vices, the matron, who perchance had gone to the spectacle a
modest woman, returns from it immodest. Still further, what a degradation of morals it is,
what a stimulus to abominable deeds, what food for vice, to be polluted by histrionic gestures,
against the covenant and law of one’s birth, to gaze in detail upon the endurance of incestuous
abominations! Men are emasculated, and all the pride and vigour of their sex is effeminated
in the disgrace of their enervated body; and he is most pleasing there who has most completely
broken down the man into the woman. He grows into praise by virtue of his crime; and the
more he is degraded, the more skilful he is considered to be. Such a one is looked upon—oh
shame! and looked upon with pleasure. And what cannot such a creature suggest? He inflames
the senses, he flatters the affections, he drives out the more vigorous conscience of
a virtuous breast; nor is there wanting authority for the enticing abomination, that the
mischief may creep upon people with a less perceptible approach. They picture Venus immodest,
Mars adulterous; and that Jupiter of theirs not more supreme in dominion than in
vice, inflamed with earthly love in the midst of his own thunders, now growing white in the
feathers of a swan, now pouring down in a golden shower, now breaking forth by the help
of birds to violate the purity of boys. And now put the question, Can he who looks upon
such things be healthy-minded or modest? Men imitate the gods whom they adore, and to
such miserable beings their crimes become their religion.2120</p>
<p>9. Oh, if placed on that lofty watch-tower you could gaze into the secret places—if you
could open the closed doors of sleeping chambers, and recall their dark recesses to the per-
<note type="footnote">2118 [Alas, that in the modern theatre and opera all this has been reproduced, and Christians applaud!]</note>

<pb n="692"/>
ception of sight,—you would behold things done by immodest persons which no chaste eye
could look upon; you would see what even to see is a crime; you would see what people
embruted with the madness of vice deny that they have done, and yet hasten to do,—men
with frenzied lusts rushing upon men, doing things which afford no gratification even to
those who do them. I am deceived if the man who is guilty of such things as these does not
accuse others of them. The depraved maligns the depraved, and thinks that he himself,
though conscious of the guilt, has escaped, as if consciousness were not a sufficient condemnation.
The same people who are accusers in public are criminals in private, condemning
themselves at the same time as they condemn the culprits; they denounce abroad what they
commit at home, willingly doing what, when they have done, they accuse,—a daring which
assuredly is fitly mated with vice, and an impudence quite in accordance with shameless
people. And I beg you not to wonder at the things that persons of this kind speak: the offence
of their mouths in words is the least of which they are guilty.2121</p>
<p>10. But after considering the public roads full of pitfalls, after battles of many kinds
scattered abroad over the whole world, after exhibitions either bloody or infamous, after
the abominations of lust, whether exposed for sale in brothels or hidden within the domestic
walls—abominations, the audacity of which is greater in proportion to the secrecy of the
crime,—possibly you may think that the Forum at least is free from such things, that it is
neither exposed to exasperating wrongs, nor polluted by the association of criminals. Then
turn your gaze in that direction: there you will discover things more odious than ever, so
that thence you will be more desirous of turning away your eyes, although the laws are
carved on twelve tables, and the statutes are publicly prescribed on brazen tablets. Yet wrong
is done in the midst of the laws themselves; wickedness is committed in the very face of the
statutes; innocence is not preserved even in the place where it is defended. By turns the
rancour of disputants rages; and when peace is broken among the togas,2122 the Forum
echoes with the madness of strife. There close at hand is the spear and the sword, and the
executioner also; there is the claw that tears, the rack that stretches, the fire that burns
up,—more tortures for one poor human body than it has limbs. And in such cases who is
there to help? One’s patron? He makes a feint, and deceives. The judge? But he sells his
sentence. He who sits to avenge crimes commits them, and the judge becomes the culprit,
in order that the accused may perish innocently. Crimes are everywhere common; and
everywhere in the multiform character of sin, the pernicious poison acts by means of degraded
minds. One man forges a will, another by a capital fraud makes a false deposition; on the
one hand, children are cheated of their inheritances, on the other, strangers are endowed
with their estates. The opponent makes his charge, the false accuser attacks, the witness

<pb n="693"/>
defames, on all sides the venal impudence of hired voices sets about the falsification of
charges, while in the meantime the guilty do not even perish with the innocent. There is no
fear about the laws; no concern for either inquisitor or judge; when the sentence can be
bought off for money, it is not cared for. It is a crime now among the guilty to be innocent;
whoever does not imitate the wicked is an offence to them. The laws have come to terms
with crimes, and whatever is public has begun to be allowed. What can be the modesty, what
can be the integrity, that prevails there, when there are none to condemn the wicked, and
one only meets with those who ought themselves to be condemned?</p>
<p>11. But that we may not perchance appear as if we were picking out extreme cases, and
with the view of disparagement were seeking to attract your attention to those things
whereof the sad and revolting view may offend the gaze of a better conscience, I will now
direct you to such things as the world in its ignorance accounts good. Among these also you
will behold things that will shock you. In respect of what you regard as honours, of what
you consider the fasces, what you count affluence in riches, what you think power in the
camp, the glory of the purple in the magisterial office, the power of licence in the chief
command,—there is hidden the virus of ensnaring mischief, and an appearance of smiling
wickedness, joyous indeed, but the treacherous deception of hidden calamity. Just as some
poison, in which the flavour having been medicated with sweetness, craftily mingled in its
deadly juices, seems, when taken, to be an ordinary draught, but when it is drunk up, the
destruction that you have swallowed assails you. You see, forsooth, that man distinguished
by his brilliant dress, glittering, as he thinks, in his purple. Yet with what baseness has he
purchased this glitter! What contempts of the proud has he had first to submit to! what
haughty thresholds has he, as an early courtier, besieged! How many scornful footsteps of
arrogant great men has he had to precede, thronged in the crowd of clients, that by and by
a similar procession might attend and precede him with salutations,—a train waiting not
upon his person, but upon his power! for he has no claim to be regarded for his character,
but for his fasces. Of these, finally, you may see the degrading end, when the time-serving
sycophant has departed, and the hanger-on, deserting them, has defiled the exposed side of
the man who has retired into a private condition.2123 It is then that the mischiefs done to
the squandered family-estate smite upon the conscience, then the losses that have exhausted
the fortune are known,—expenses by which the favour of the populace was bought, and the
people’s breath asked for with fickle and empty entreaties. Assuredly, it was a vain and
foolish boastfulness to have desired to set forth in the gratification of a disappointing spectacle,
what the people would not receive, and what would ruin the magistrates.</p>
<p>12. But those, moreover, whom you consider rich, who add forests to forests, and who,
excluding the poor from their neighbourhood, stretch out their fields far and wide into
<note type="footnote">2123 [Confirmed by all the Roman satirists, as will be recalled by the reader. Conf. Horace, Sat., vi. book i.]</note>

<pb n="694"/>
space without any limits, who possess immense heaps of silver and gold and mighty sums
of money, either in built-up heaps or in buried stores,—even in the midst of their riches
those are torn to pieces by the anxiety of vague thought, lest the robber should spoil, lest
the murderer should attack, lest the envy of some wealthier neighbour should become hostile,
and harass them with malicious lawsuits. Such a one enjoys no security either in his food
or in his sleep. In the midst of the banquet he sighs, although he drinks from a jewelled
goblet; and when his luxurious bed has enfolded his body, languid with feasting, in its
yielding bosom, he lies wakeful in the midst of the down; nor does he perceive, poor wretch,
that these things are merely gilded torments, that he is held in bondage by his gold, and that
he is the slave of his luxury and wealth rather than their master. And oh, the odious blindness
of perception, and the deep darkness of senseless greed! although he might disburden himself
and get rid of the load, he rather continues to brood over his vexing wealth,—he goes on
obstinately clinging to his tormenting hoards. From him there is no liberality to dependents,
no communication to the poor. And yet such people call that their own money, which they
guard with jealous labour, shut up at home as if it were another’s, and from which they derive
no benefit either for their friends, for their children, or, in fine, for themselves. Their possession
amounts to this only, that they can keep others from possessing it; and oh, what a
marvellous perversion of names! they call those things goods, which they absolutely put to
none but bad uses.</p>
<p>13. Or think you that even those are secure,—that those at least are safe with some stable
permanence among the chaplets of honour and vast wealth, whom, in the glitter of royal
palaces, the safeguard of watchful arms surrounds? They have greater fear than others. A
man is constrained to dread no less than he is dreaded. Exaltation exacts its penalties equally
from the more powerful, although he may be hedged in with bands of satellites, and may
guard his person with the enclosure and protection of a numerous retinue. Even as he does
not allow his inferiors to feel security, it is inevitable that he himself should want the sense
of security. The power of those whom power makes terrible to others, is, first of all, terrible
to themselves. It smiles to rage, it cajoles to deceive, it entices to slay, it lifts up to cast down.
With a certain usury of mischief, the greater the height of dignity and honours attained, the
greater is the interest of penalty required.</p>
<p>14. Hence, then, the one peaceful and trustworthy tranquillity, the one solid and firm
and constant security, is this, for a man to withdraw from these eddies of a distracting world,
and, anchored on the ground of the harbour of salvation, to lift his eyes from earth to
heaven; and having been admitted to the gift of God, and being already very near to his God
in mind, he may boast, that whatever in human affairs others esteem lofty and grand, lies
altogether beneath his consciousness. He who is actually greater than the world can crave
nothing, can desire nothing, from the world. How stable, how free from all shocks is that
safeguard; how heavenly the protection in its perennial blessings,—to be loosed from the

<pb n="695"/>
snares of this entangling world, and to be purged from earthly dregs, and fitted for the light
of eternal immortality! He will see what crafty mischief of the foe that previously attacked
us has been in progress against us. We are constrained to have more love for what we shall
be, by being allowed to know and to condemn what we were. Neither for this purpose is it
necessary to pay a price either in the way of bribery or of labour; so that man’s elevation or
dignity or power should be begotten in him with elaborate effort; but it is a gratuitous gift
from God, and it is accessible to all. As the sun shines spontaneously, as the day gives light,
as the fountain flows, as the shower yields moisture, so does the heavenly Spirit infuse itself
into us. When the soul, in its gaze into heaven, has recognised its Author, it rises higher
than the sun, and far transcends all this earthly power, and begins to be that which it believes
itself to be.2124</p>
<p>15. Do you, however, whom the celestial warfare has enlisted in the spiritual camp, only
observe a discipline uncorrupted and chastened in the virtues of religion. Be constant as
well in prayer as in reading; now speak with God, now let God speak with you, let Him instruct
you in His precepts, let Him direct you. Whom He has made rich, none shall make
poor; for, in fact, there can be no poverty to him whose breast has once been supplied with
heavenly food. Ceilings enriched with gold, and houses adorned with mosaics of costly
marble, will seem mean to you, now when you know that it is you yourself who are rather
to be perfected, you who are rather to be adorned, and that that dwelling in which God has
dwelt as in a temple, in which the Holy Spirit has begun to make His abode, is of more importance
than all others. Let us embellish this house with the colours of innocence, let us
enlighten it with the light of justice: this will never fall into decay with the wear of age, nor
shall it be defiled by the tarnishing of the colours of its walls, nor of its gold. Whatever is
artificially beautified is perishing; and such things as contain not the reality of possession
afford no abiding assurance to their possessors. But this remains in a beauty perpetually
vivid, in perfect honour, in permanent splendour. It can neither decay nor be destroyed; it
can only be fashioned into greater perfection when the body returns to it.</p>
<p>16. These things, dearest Donatus, briefly for the present. For although what you profitably
hear delights your patience, indulgent in its goodness, your well-balanced mind, and
your assured faith—and nothing is so pleasant to your ears as what is pleasant to you in
God,—yet, as we are associated as neighbours, and are likely to talk together frequently, we
ought to have some moderation in our conversation; and since this is a holiday rest, and a
time of leisure, whatever remains of the day, now that the sun is sloping towards the evening,
2125 let us spend it in gladness, nor let even the hour of repast be without heavenly grace.

<head>Epistle II.2127</head>
<p>From the Roman Clergy to the Carthaginian Clergy, About the Retirement of
the Blessed Cyprian.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Roman Clergy Had Learnt from Crementius the Sub-Deacon, that
in the Time of Persecution Cyprian Had Withdrawn Himself. Therefore, with
Their Accustomed Zeal for the Faith, They Remind the Carthaginian Clergy of
Their Duty, and Instruct Them What to Do in the Case of the Lapsed, During
the Interval of the Bishop’s Absence.</p>
<p>1. We have been informed by Crementius the sub-deacon, who came to us from you,
that the blessed father2128 Cyprian has for a certain reason withdrawn; “in doing which he
acted quite rightly, because he is a person of eminence, and because a conflict is impending,”
which God has allowed in the world, for the sake of cooperating with His servants in their
struggle against the adversary, and was, moreover, willing that this conflict should show to
angels and to men that the victor shall be crowned, while the vanquished shall in himself
receive the doom which has been made manifest to us. Since, moreover, it devolves upon
us who appear to be placed on high, in the place of a shepherd,2129 to keep watch over the
flock; if we be found neglectful, it will be said to us, as it was said to our predecessors also,
who in such wise negligent had been placed in charge, that “we have not sought for that
which was lost, and have not corrected the wanderer, and have not bound up that which
was broken, but have eaten their milk, and been clothed with their wool;”2130 and then also
the Lord Himself, fulfilling what had been written in the law and the prophets, teaches,
saying, “I am the good shepherd, who lay down my life for the sheep. But the hireling, whose
own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the
wolf scattereth them.”2131 To Simon, too, He speaks thus: “Lovest thou me? He answered,
I do love Thee. He saith to him, Feed my sheep.”2132 We know that this saying arose out of
the very circumstance of his withdrawal, and the rest of the disciples did likewise.2133</p>

<pb n="698"/>
<p>2. We are unwilling, therefore, beloved brethren, that you should be found hirelings,
but we desire you to be good shepherds, since you are aware that no slight danger threatens
you if you do not exhort our brethren to stand stedfast in the faith, so that the brotherhood
be not absolutely rooted out, as being of those who rush headlong into idolatry. Neither is
it in words only that we exhort you to this; but you will be able to ascertain from very many
who come to you from us, that, God blessing us, we both have done and still do all these
things ourselves with all anxiety and worldly risk, having before our eyes rather the fear of
God and eternal sufferings than the fear of men and a short-lived discomfort, not forsaking
the brethren, but exhorting them to stand firm in the faith, and to be ready to go with the
Lord. And we have even recalled those who were ascending2134 to do that to which they
were constrained. The Church stands in faith, notwithstanding that some have been driven
to fall by very terror, whether that they were persons of eminence, or that they were afraid,
when seized, with the fear of man: these, however, we did not abandon, although they were
separated from us, but exhorted them, and do exhort them, to repent, if in any way they
may receive pardon from Him who is able to grant it; lest, haply, if they should be deserted
by us, they should become worse.</p>
<p>3. You see, then, brethren, that you also ought to do the like, so that even those who
have fallen may amend their minds by your exhortation; and if they should be seized once
more, may confess, and may so make amends for their previous sin. And there are other
matters which are incumbent on you, which also we have here added, as that if any who
may have fallen into this temptation begin to be taken with sickness, and repent of what
they have done, and desire communion, it should in any wise be granted them. Or if you
have widows or bedridden people2135 who are unable to maintain themselves, or those who
are in prisons or are excluded from their own dwellings, these ought in all cases to have
some to minister to them. Moreover, catechumens when seized with sickness ought not to
be deceived,2136 but help is to be afforded them. And, as matter of the greatest importance,
if the bodies of the martyrs and others be not buried, a considerable risk is incurred by those
whose duty it is to do this office. By whomsoever of you, then, and on whatever occasion
this duty may have been performed, we are sure that he is regarded as a good servant,—as
one who has been faithful in the least, and will be appointed ruler over ten cities. May God,
however, who gives all things to them that hope in Him, grant to us that we may all be found
<note type="footnote">to reflect on Cyprian’s withdrawal. But note, it asserts that the pasce oves meas was a reproach to St. Peter, and
was understood to be so by his fellow-apostles. In other words, our Lord, so these clergy argue, bade St. Peter

<head>Epistle III.2137</head>
<p>To the Presbyters and Deacons Abiding at Rome. a.d. 250.</p>
<p>Argument.—This is a Familiar and Friendly Epistle; So that It Requires No Formal
Argument, Especially as It Can Be Sufficiently Gathered from the Title Itself.
The Letter of the Roman Clergy, to Which Cyprian is Replying, is Missing.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the elders and deacons, brethren abiding at Rome, sends, greeting. When
the report of the departure of the excellent man, my colleague,2138 was still uncertain among
us, my beloved brethren, and I was wavering doubtfully in my opinion on the matter, I received
a letter sent to me from you by Crementius the sub-deacon, in which I was most
abundantly informed of his glorious end; and I rejoiced greatly that, in harmony with the
integrity of his administration, an honourable consummation also attended him. Wherein,
moreover, I greatly congratulate you, that you honour his memory with a testimony so
public and so illustrious, so that by your means is made known to me, not only what is
glorious to you in connection with the memory of your bishop, but what ought to afford to
me also an example of faith and virtue. For in proportion as the fall of a bishop is an event
which tends ruinously to the fall of his followers, so on the other hand it is a useful and
helpful thing when a bishop, by the firmness of his faith, sets himself forth to his brethren
as an object of imitation.</p>
<p>2. I have, moreover, read another epistle,2139 in which neither the person who wrote
nor the persons to whom it was written were plainly declared; and inasmuch as in the same
letter both the writing and the matter, and even the paper itself, gave me the idea that
something had been taken away, or had been changed from the original, I have sent you
back the epistle as it actually came to hand, that you may examine whether it is the very
same which you gave to Crementius the sub-deacon, to carry. For it is a very serious thing
if the truth of a clerical letter is corrupted by any falsehood or deceit. In order, then, that
we may know this, ascertain whether the writing and subscription are yours, and write me
again what is the truth of the matter. I bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle IV.2140</head>
<p>To the Presbyters and Deacons.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Exhorts His Clergy from His Place of Retirement, that in His
Absence They Should Be United; That Nothing Should Be Wanting to Prisoners
or to the Rest of the Poor; And Further, that They Should Keep the People in
Quiet, Lest, If They Should Rush in Crowds to Visit the Martyrs in Prison, This
Privilege Should at Length Be Forbidden Them. a.d. 250.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his beloved brethren, greeting. Being by the
grace of God in safety, dearest brethren, I salute you, rejoicing that I am informed of the
prosperity of all things in respect of your safety also; and as the condition of the place2141
does not permit me to be with you now, I beg you, by your faith and your religion, to discharge
there both your own office and mine, that there may be nothing wanting either to
discipline or diligence. In respect of means, moreover, for meeting the expenses, whether
for those who, having confessed their Lord with a glorious voice, have been put in prison,
or for those who are labouring in poverty and want, and still stand fast in the Lord, I entreat
that nothing be wanting, since the whole of the small sum which was collected there was
distributed among the clergy for cases of that kind, that many might have means whence
they could assist the necessities and burthens of individuals.</p>
<p>2. I beg also that there may be no lack, on your parts, of wisdom and carefulness to
preserve peace. For although from their affection the brethren are eager to approach and
to visit those good confessors, on whom by their glorious beginnings the divine consideration
has already shed a brightness, yet I think that this eagerness must be cautiously indulged,
and not in crowds,—not in numbers collected together at once, lest from this very thing illwill
be aroused, and the means of access be denied, and thus, while we insatiably wish for
all, we lose all. Take counsel, therefore, and see that this may be more safely managed with
moderation, so that the presbyters also, who there offer2142 with the confessors, may one
by one take turns with the deacons individually; because, by thus changing the persons and
varying the people that come together, suspicion is diminished. For, meek and humble in
all things, as befits the servants of God, we ought to accommodate ourselves to the times,
and to provide for quietness, and to have regard to the people. I bid you, brethren, beloved

<head>Epistle V.2143</head>
<p>To the Presbyters and Deacons.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Argument of This Letter is Nearly the Same as that of the Preceding
One, Except that the Writer Directs the Confessors Also to Be Admonished by
the Clergy of Their Duty, to Give Attention to Humility, and Obey the Presbyters
and Deacons. His Own Retirement Incidentally Furnishes an Occasion for This.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. I had wished indeed,
beloved brethren, with this my letter to greet the whole of my clergy in health and safety.
But since the stormy time which has in a great measure overwhelmed my people, has,
moreover, added this enhancement to my sorrows, that it has touched with its desolation
even a portion of the clergy, I pray the Lord that, by the divine mercy, I may hereafter greet
you at all events as safe, who, as I have learned, stand fast both in faith and virtue. And although
some reasons might appear to urge me to the duty of myself hastening to come to
you, firstly, for instance, because of my eagerness and desire for you, which is the chief
consideration in my prayers, and then, that we might be able to consult together on those
matters which are required by the general advantage, in respect of the government of the
Church, and having carefully examined them with abundant counsel, might wisely arrange
them;—yet it seemed to me better, still to preserve my retreat and my quiet for a while, with
a view to other advantages connected with the peace and safety of us all:—which advantages
an account will be given you by our beloved brother Tertullus, who, besides his other care
which he zealously bestows on divine labours, was, moreover, the author of this counsel;
that I should be cautious and moderate, and not rashly trust myself into the sight of the
public; and especially that I should beware of that place where I had been so often inquired
for and sought after.</p>
<p>2. Relying, therefore, upon your love and your piety, which I have abundantly known,
in this letter I both exhort and command you, that those of you whose presence there is
least suspicious and least perilous, should in my stead discharge my duty, in respect of doing
those things which are required for the religious administration. In the meantime let the
poor be taken care of as much and as well as possible; but especially those who have stood
with unshaken faith and have not forsaken Christ’s flock, that, by your diligence, means be
supplied to them to enable them to bear their poverty, so that what the troublous time has
not effected in respect of their faith, may not be accomplished by want in respect of their
afflictions. Let a more earnest care, moreover, be bestowed upon the glorious confessors.
<note type="footnote">2143 Oxford ed.: Ep. xiv. a.d. 250.</note>

<pb n="704"/>
And although I know that very many of those have been maintained by the vow2144 and by
the love of the brethren, yet if there be any who are in want either of clothing or maintenance,
let them be supplied, with whatever things are necessary, as I formerly wrote to you, while
they were still kept in prison,—only let them know from you and be instructed, and learn
what, according to the authority of Scripture, the discipline of the Church requires of them,
that they ought to be humble and modest and peaceable, that they should maintain the
honour of their name, so that those who have achieved glory by what they have testified,
may achieve glory also by their characters, and in all things seeking the Lord’s approval,
may show themselves worthy, in consummation of their praise, to attain a heavenly crown.
For there remains more than what is yet seen to be accomplished, since it is written “Praise
not any man before his death;”2145 and again, “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give
thee a crown of life.”2146 And the Lord also says, “He that endureth to the end, the same
shall be saved.”2147 Let them imitate the Lord, who at the very time of His passion was not
more proud, but more humble. For then He washed His disciples’ feet, saying, “If I, your
Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one another’s feet. For I have
given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.”2148 Let them also follow
the example of the Apostle Paul, who, after often-repeated imprisonment, after scourging,
after exposures to wild beasts, in everything continued meek and humble; and even after
his rapture to the third heaven and paradise, he did not proudly arrogate anything to himself
when he said, “Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought, but wrought with labour
and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you.”2149</p>
<p>3. These several matters, I pray you, suggest to our brethren. And as “he who humbleth
himself shall be exalted,”2150 now is the time when they should rather fear the ensnaring
adversary, who more eagerly attacks the man that is strongest, and becoming more virulent,
for the very reason that he is conquered, strives to overcome his conqueror. The Lord grant
that I may soon both see them again, and by salutary exhortation may establish their minds
to preserve their glory. For I am grieved when I hear that some of them run about wickedly
and proudly, and give themselves up to follies or to discords; that members of Christ, and
even members that have confessed Christ, are defiled by unlawful concubinage, and cannot

of a few,2151 the honourable glories of many and good confessors are tarnished;2152 whom
they ought to fear, lest, being condemned by their testimony and judgment, they be excluded
from their fellowship. That, finally, is the illustrious and true confessor, concerning whom
afterwards the Church does not blush, but boasts.</p>
<p>4. In respect of that which our fellow-presbyters, Donatus and Fortunatus, Novatus and
Gordius, wrote to me, I have not been able to reply by myself, since, from the first commencement
of my episcopacy, I made up my mind to do nothing on my own private opinion,
without your advice and without the consent of the people.2153 But as soon as, by the grace
of God, I shall have come to you, then we will discuss in common, as our respective dignity
requires, those things which either have been or are to be done. I bid you, brethren beloved
and dearly longed-for, ever heartily farewell, and be mindful of me. Greet the brotherhood
that is with you earnestly from me, and tell them to remember me. Farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle VI.2154</head>
<p>To Rogatianus the Presbyter, and the Other Confessors. a.d. 250.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Exhorts Rogatianus and the Other Confessors to Maintain Discipline,
that None Who Had Confessed Christ in Word Should Seem to Deny Him in
Deed; Casually Rebuking Some of Them, Who, Being Exiled on Account of the
Faith, Were Not Afraid to Return Unbidden into Their Country.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyter Rogatianus, and to the other confessors, his brethren,
greeting. I had both heretofore, dearly beloved and bravest brethren, sent you a letter, in
which I congratulated your faith and virtue with exulting words, and now my voice has no
other object, first of all, than with joyous mind, repeatedly and always to announce the glory
of your name. For what can I wish greater or better in my prayers than to see the flock of
Christ enlightened by the honour of your confession? For although all the brethren ought
to rejoice in this, yet, in the common gladness, the share of the bishop is the greatest. For
the glory of the Church is the glory of the bishop.2155 In proportion as we grieve over those
whom a hostile persecution has cast down, in the same proportion we rejoice over you
whom the devil has not been able to overcome.</p>
<p>2. Yet I exhort you by our common faith, by the true and simple love of my heart towards
you, that, having overcome the adversary in this first encounter, you should hold fast your
glory with a brave and persevering virtue. We are still in the world; we are still placed in the
battle-field; we fight daily for our lives. Care must be taken, that after such beginnings as
these there should also come an increase, and that what you have begun to be with such a
blessed commencement should be consummated in you. It is a slight thing to have been
able to attain anything; it is more to be able to keep what you have attained; even as faith
itself and saving birth makes alive, not by being received, but by being preserved. Nor is it
actually the attainment, but the perfecting, that keeps a man for God. The Lord taught this
in His instruction when He said, “Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse
thing come unto thee.”2156 Conceive of Him as saying this also to His confessor, “Lo thou
art made a confessor; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.” Solomon also, and
Saul, and many others, so long as they walked in the Lord’s ways, were able to keep the grace
given to them. When the discipline of the Lord was forsaken by them, grace also forsook
them.</p>

<pb n="707"/>
<p>3. We must persevere in the straight and narrow road of praise and glory; and since
peacefulness and humility and the tranquillity of a good life is fitting for all Christians, according
to the word of the Lord, who looks to none other man than “to him that is poor
and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at”2157 His word, it the more behoves you confessors,
who have been made an example to the rest of the brethren, to observe and fulfil
this, as being those whose characters should provoke to imitation the life and conduct of
all. For as the Jews were alienated from God, as those on whose account “the name of God
is blasphemed among the Gentiles,”2158 so on the other hand those are dear to God through
whose conformity to discipline the name of God is declared with a testimony of praise, as
it is written, the Lord Himself forewarning and saying, “Let your light so shine before men
that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”2159 And
Paul the apostle says, “Shine as lights in the world.”2160 And similarly Peter exhorts: “As
strangers,” says he, “and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul,
having your conversation honest among the Gentiles; that whereas they speak against you
as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify the Lord.”2161
This, indeed, the greatest part of you, I rejoice to say, are careful for; and, made better by
the honour of your confession itself, guard and preserve its glory by tranquil and virtuous
lives.</p>
<p>4. But I hear that some infect your number, and destroy the praise of a distinguished
name by their corrupt conversation; whom you yourselves, even as being lovers and
guardians of your own praise, should rebuke and check and correct. For what a disgrace is
suffered by your name, when one spends his days in intoxication and debauchery,2162 another
returns to that country whence he was banished, to perish when arrested, not now as
being a Christian, but as being a criminal!2163 I hear that some are puffed up and are arrogant,
although it is written, “Be not high-minded, but fear: for if God spared not the natural
branches, take heed lest He also spare not thee.”2164 Our Lord “was led as a sheep to the
slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearers is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.”2165 “I

am not rebellious,” says He, “neither do I gainsay. I gave my back to the smiters, and my
cheeks to the palms of their hands. I hid not my face from the filthiness of spitting.”2166
And dares any one now, who lives by and in this very One, lift up himself and be haughty,
forgetful, as well of the deeds which He did, as of the commands which He left to us either
by Himself or by His apostles? But if “the servant is not greater than his Lord,”2167 let those
who follow the Lord humbly and peacefully and silently tread in His steps, since the lower
one is, the more exalted he may become; as says the Lord, “He that is least among you, the
same shall be great.”2168</p>
<p>5. What, then, is that—how execrable should it appear to you—which I have learnt with
extreme anguish and grief of mind, to wit, that there are not wanting those who defile the
temples of God, and the members sanctified after confession and made glorious,2169 with
a disgraceful and infamous concubinage, associating their beds promiscuously with women’s!
In which, even if there be no pollution of their conscience, there is a great guilt in this very
thing, that by their offence originate examples for the ruin of others.2170 There ought also
to be no contentions and emulations among you, since the Lord left to us His peace, and it
is written, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”2171 “But if ye bite and find fault with
one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.”2172 From abuse and revilings
also I entreat you to abstain, for “revilers do not attain the kingdom of God;”2173 and
the tongue which has confessed Christ should be preserved sound and pure with its honour.
For he who, according to Christ’s precept, speaks things peaceable and good and just, daily
confesses Christ. We had renounced the world when we were baptized; but we have now
indeed renounced the world when tried and approved by God, we leave all that we have,
and have followed the Lord, and stand and live in His faith and fear.</p>
<p>6. Let us confirm one another by mutual exhortations, and let us more and more go
forward in the Lord; so that when of His mercy He shall have made that peace which He
promises to give, we may return to the Church new and almost changed men, and may be
received, whether by our brethren or by the heathen, in all things corrected and renewed
for the better; and those who formerly admired our glory in our courage may now admire

<head>Epistle VII.2175</head>
<p>To the Clergy, Concerning Prayer to God.
Argument.—The Argument of the Present Epistle is Nearly the Same as that of the
Two Preceding, Except that He Exhorts in This to Diligent Prayer.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. Although I know,
brethren beloved, that from the fear which we all of us owe to God, you also are instantly
urgent in continual petitions and earnest prayers to Him, still I myself remind your religious
anxiety, that in order to appease and entreat the Lord, we must lament not only in words,
but also with fastings and with tears, and with every kind of urgency. For we must perceive
and confess that the so disordered ruin arising from that affliction, which has in a great
measure laid waste, and is even still laying waste, our flock, has visited us according to our
sins, in that we do not keep the way of the Lord, nor observe the heavenly commandments
given to us for our salvation. Our Lord did the will of His Father, and we do not do the will
of our Lord; eager about our patrimony and our gain, seeking to satisfy our pride, yielding
ourselves wholly to emulation and to strife, careless of simplicity and faith, renouncing the
world in words only, and not in deeds, every one of us pleasing himself, and displeasing all
others,2176—therefore we are smitten as we deserve, since it is written: “And that servant,
which knoweth his master’s will, and has not obeyed his will, shall be beaten with many
stripes.”2177 But what stripes, what blows, do we not deserve, when even confessors, who
ought to be an example of virtuous life to others, do not maintain discipline? Therefore,
while an inflated and immodest boastfulness about their own confession excessively elates
some, tortures come upon them, and tortures without any cessation of the tormentor,
without any end of condemnation, without any comfort of death,—tortures which do not
easily let them pass to the crown, but wrench them on the rack until they cause them to
abandon their faith, unless some one taken away by the divine compassion should depart
in the very midst of the torments, gaining glory not by the cessation of his torture, but by
the quickness of his death.</p>

<pb n="711"/>
<p>2. These things we suffer by our own fault and our own deserving, even as the divine
judgment has forewarned us, saying, “If they forsake my law and walk not in my judgments,
if they profane my statutes and keep not my commandments, then will I visit their transgressions
with the rod, and their iniquities with stripes.”2178 It is for this reason that we feel the
rods and the stripes, because we neither please God with good deeds nor atone2179 for our
sins. Let us of our inmost heart and of our entire mind ask for God’s mercy, because He
Himself also adds, saying, “Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not scatter away from
them.”2180 Let us ask, and we shall receive; and if there be delay and tardiness in our receiving,
since we have grievously offended, let us knock, because “to him that knocketh also it shall
be opened,”2181 if only our prayers, our groanings, and our tears, knock at the door; and
with these we must be urgent and persevering, even although prayer be offered with one
mind.2182</p>
<p>3. For,—which the more induced and constrained me to write this letter to you,—you
ought to know (since the Lord has condescended to show and to reveal it) that it was said
in a vision, “Ask, and ye shall obtain.” Then, afterwards, that the attending people were
bidden to pray for certain persons pointed out to them, but that in their petitions there were
dissonant voices, and wills disagreeing, and that this excessively displeased Him who had
said, “Ask, and ye shall obtain,” because the disagreement of the people was out of harmony,
and there was not a consent of the brethren one and simple, and a united concord; since it
is written, “God who maketh men to be of one mind in a house;”2183 and we read in the
Acts of the Apostles, “And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one
soul.”2184 And the Lord has bidden us with His own voice, saying, “This is my command,
that ye love one another.”2185 And again, “I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on
earth as touching anything that you shall ask, it shall be done for you of my Father which
is in heaven.”2186 But if two of one mind can do so much, what might be effected if the unanimity
prevailed among all? But if, according to the peace which our Lord gave us, there
were agreement among all brethren, we should before this have obtained from the divine

mercy what we seek; nor should we be wavering so long in this peril of our salvation and
our faith. Yes, truly, and these evils would not have come upon the brethren, if the brotherhood
had been animated with one spirit.</p>
<p>4. For there also was shown that there sate the father of a family, a young man also being
seated at his right hand, who, anxious and somewhat sad with a kind of indignation, holding
his chin in his right hand, occupied his place with a sorrowful look. But another standing
on the left hand, bore a net, which he threatened to throw, in order to catch the people
standing round.2187 And when he who saw marvelled what this could be, it was told him
that the youth who was thus sitting on the right hand was saddened and grieved because
his commandments were not observed; but that he on the left was exultant because an opportunity
was afforded him of receiving from the father of the family the power of destroying.
This was shown long before the tempest of this devastation arose. And we have seen that
which had been shown fulfilled; that while we despise the commandments of the Lord, while
we do not keep the salutary ordinances of the law that He has given, the enemy was receiving
a power of doing mischief, and was overwhelming, by the cast of his net, those who were
imperfectly armed and too careless to resist.</p>
<p>5. Let us urgently pray and groan with continual petitions. For know, beloved brethren,
that I was not long ago reproached with this also in a vision, that we were sleepy in our
prayers, and did not pray with watchfulness; and undoubtedly God, who “rebukes whom
He loves,”2188 when He rebukes, rebukes that He may amend, amends that He may preserve.
Let us therefore strike off and break away from the bonds of sleep, and pray with urgency
and watchfulness, as the Apostle Paul bids us, saying, “Continue in prayer, and watch in the
same.”2189 For the apostles also ceased not to pray day and night; and the Lord also Himself,
the teacher of our discipline, and the way of our example, frequently and watchfully prayed,
as we read in the Gospel: “He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in
prayer to God.”2190 And assuredly what He prayed for, He prayed for on our behalf, since
He was not a sinner, but bore the sins of others. But He so prayed for us, that in another
place we read, “And the Lord said to Peter, Behold, Satan has desired to sift you as wheat:
but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.”2191 But if for us and for our sins He both
laboured and watched and prayed, how much more ought we to be instant in prayers; and,
first of all, to pray and to entreat the Lord Himself, and then through Him, to make satisfac-

tion to God the Father! We have an advocate and an intercessor for our sins, Jesus Christ
the Lord and our God, if only we repent of our sins past, and confess and acknowledge our
sins, whereby we now offend the Lord, and for the time to come engage to walk in His ways,
and to fear His commandments. The Father corrects and protects us, if we still stand fast
in the faith both in afflictions and perplexities, that is to say, cling closely to His Christ; as
it is written, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress,
or persecution, or famine or nakedness, or peril, or sword?”2192 None of these things can
separate believers, nothing can tear away those who are clinging to His body and blood.
Persecution of that kind is an examination and searching out of the heart. God wills us to
be sifted and proved, as He has always proved His people; and yet in His trials help has
never at any time been wanting to believers.</p>
<p>6. Finally, to the very least of His servants although placed among very many sins, and
unworthy of His condescension, yet He has condescended of His goodness towards us to
command:2193 “Tell him,” said He, “to be safe, because peace is coming; but that, in the
meantime, there is a little delay, that some who still remain may be proved.” But we are admonished
by these divine condescensions both concerning a spare diet and a temperate use
of drink; to wit, lest worldly enticement should enervate the breast now elevated with celestial
vigour, or lest the mind, weighed down by too abundant feasting, should be less watchful
unto prayers and supplication.</p>
<p>7. It was my duty not to conceal these special matters, nor to hide them alone in my
own consciousness,—matters by which each one of us may be both instructed and guided.
And do not you for your part keep this letter concealed among yourselves, but let the brethren
have it to read. For it is the part of one who desires that his brother should not be warned
and instructed, to intercept those words with which the Lord condescends to admonish and
instruct us. Let them know that we are proved by our Lord, and let them never fail of that
faith whereby we have once believed in Him, under the conflict of this present affliction.
Let each one, acknowledging his own sins, even now put off the conversation of the old
man. “For no man who looks back as he putteth his hand to the plough is fit for the kingdom
of God.”2194 And, finally, Lot’s wife, who, when she was delivered, looked back in defiance
of the commandment, lost the benefit of her escape.2195 Let us look not to things which are
behind, whither the devil calls us back, but to things which are before, whither Christ calls

us. Let us lift up our eyes to heaven, lest the earth with its delights and enticements deceive
us. Let each one of us pray God not for himself only, but for all the brethren, even as the
Lord has taught us to pray, when He bids to each one, not private prayer, but enjoined them,
when they prayed, to pray for all in common prayer and concordant supplication.2196 If the
Lord shall behold us humble and peaceable; if He shall see us joined one with another; if
He shall see us fearful concerning His anger; if corrected and amended by the present
tribulation, He will maintain us safe from the disturbances of the enemy. Discipline hath
preceded; pardon also shall follow.</p>
<p>8. Let us only, without ceasing to ask, and with full faith that we shall receive, in simplicity
and unanimity beseech the Lord, entreating not only with groaning but with tears, as it behoves
those to entreat who are situated between the ruins of those who wail, and the remnants
of those who fear; between the manifold slaughter of the yielding, and the little firmness of
those who still stand. Let us ask that peace may be soon restored; that we may be quickly
helped in our concealments and our dangers; that those things may be fulfilled which the
Lord deigns to show to his servants,—the restoration of the Church, the security of our
salvation; after the rains, serenity; after the darkness, light; after the storms and whirlwinds,
a peaceful calm; the affectionate aids of paternal love, the accustomed grandeurs of the divine
majesty whereby both the blasphemy of persecutors may be restrained, the repentance of
the lapsed renewed, and the stedfast faith of the persevering may glory. I bid you, beloved
brethren, ever heartily farewell; and have me in remembrance. Salute the brotherhood in
my name; and remind them to remember me. Farewell.</p>

<p>To the Martyrs and Confessors.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian, Commending the African Martyrs Marvellously for Their
Constancy, Urges Them to Perseverance by the Example of Their Colleague
Mappalicus.</p>
<p>Cyprian to the martyrs and confessors in Christ our Lord and in God the Father, everlasting
salvation. I gladly rejoice and am thankful, most brave and blessed brethren, at
hearing of your faith and virtue, wherein the Church, our Mother, glories. Lately, indeed,
she gloried, when, in consequence of an enduring confession, that punishment was undergone
which drove the confessors of Christ into exile; yet the present confession is so much the
more illustrious and greater in honour as it is braver in suffering. The combat has increased,
and the glory of the combatants has increased also. Nor were you kept back from the struggle
by fear of tortures, but by the very tortures themselves you were more and more stimulated
to the conflict; bravely and firmly you have returned with ready devotion, to contend in the
extremest contest. Of you I find that some are already crowned, while some are even now
within reach of the crown of victory; but all whom the danger has shut up in a glorious
company are animated to carry on the struggle with an equal and common warmth of virtue,
as it behoves the soldiers of Christ in the divine camp: that no allurements may deceive the
incorruptible stedfastness of your faith, no threats terrify you, no sufferings or tortures
overcome you, because “greater is He that is in us, than he that is in the world;”2198 nor is
the earthly punishment able to do more towards casting down, than is the divine protection
towards lifting up. This truth is proved by the glorious struggle of the brethren, who, having
become leaders to the rest in overcoming their tortures, afforded an example of virtue and
faith, contending in the strife, until the strife yielded, being overcome. With what praises
can I commend you, most courageous brethren? With what vocal proclamation can I extol
the strength of your heart and the perseverance of your faith? You have borne the sharpest
examination by torture, even unto the glorious consummation, and have not yielded to
sufferings, but rather the sufferings have given way to you. The end of torments, which the
tortures themselves did not give, the crown has given. The examination by torture waxing
severer, continued for a long time to this result, not to overthrow the stedfast faith, but to
send the men of God more quickly to the Lord. The multitude of those who were present
saw with admiration the heavenly contest,—the contest of God, the spiritual contest, the
battle of Christ,—saw that His servants stood with free voice, with unyielding mind, with

<pb n="716"/>
divine virtue—bare, indeed, of weapons of this world, but believing and armed with the
weapons of faith. The tortured stood more brave than the torturers; and the limbs, beaten
and torn as they were, overcame the hooks that bent and tore them. The scourge, often repeated
with all its rage, could not conquer invincible faith, even although the membrane
which enclosed the entrails were broken, and it was no longer the limbs but the wounds of
the servants of God that were tortured. Blood was flowing which might quench the blaze
of persecution, which might subdue the flames of Gehenna with its glorious gore.2199 Oh,
what a spectacle was that to the Lord,—how sublime, how great, how acceptable to the eyes
of God in the allegiance and devotion of His soldiers! As it is written in the Psalms, when
the Holy Spirit at once speaks to us and warns us: “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of His saints.”2200 Precious is the death which has bought immortality at the cost of
its blood, which has received the crown from the consummation of its virtues. How did
Christ rejoice therein! How willingly did He both fight and conquer in such servants of His,
as the protector of their faith, and giving to believers as much as he who taketh believes that
he receives! He was present at His own contest; He lifted up, strengthened, animated the
champions and assertors of His name. And He who once conquered death on our behalf,
always conquers it in us. “When they,” says He, “deliver you up, take no thought what ye
shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that
speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.”2201 The present struggle has
afforded a proof of this saying. A voice filled with the Holy Spirit broke forth from the
martyr’s mouth when the most blessed Mappalicus said to the proconsul in the midst of his
torments, “You shall see a contest to-morrow.” And that which he said with the testimony
of virtue and faith, the Lord fulfilled. A heavenly contest was exhibited, and the servant of
God was crowned in the struggle of the promised fight. This is the contest which the
prophet Isaiah of old predicted, saying, “It shall be no light contest for you with men, since
God appoints the struggle.”2202 And in order to show what this struggle would be, he added
the words, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and ye shall call His name Emmanuel.”
2203 This is the struggle of our faith in which we engage, in which we conquer, in
which we are crowned. This is the struggle which the blessed Apostle Paul has shown to
us, in which it behoves us to run and to attain the crown of glory. “Do ye not know,” says

he, “that they which run in a race, run all indeed, but one receiveth the prize? So run that
ye may obtain.” “Now they do it that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incor-
ruptible.”2204 Moreover, setting forth his own struggle, and declaring that he himself should
soon be a sacrifice for the Lord’s sake, he says, “I am now ready to be offered, and the time
of my assumption is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also
that love His appearing.”2205 This fight, therefore, predicted of old by the prophets, begun
by the Lord, waged by the apostles, Mappalicus promised again to the proconsul in his own
name and that of his colleagues. Nor did the faithful voice deceive in his promise; he exhibited
the fight to which he had pledged himself, and he received the reward which he deserved.
I not only beseech but exhort the rest of you, that you all should follow that martyr now
most blessed, and the other partners of that engagement,—soldiers and comrades, stedfast
in faith, patient in suffering, victors in tortures,—that those who are united at once by the
bond of confession, and the entertainment of a dungeon, may also be united in the consummation
of their virtue and a celestial crown; that you by your joy may dry the tears of our
Mother, the Church, who mourns over the wreck and death of very many; and that you may
confirm, by the provocation of your example, the stedfastness of others who stand also. If
the battle shall call you out, if the day of your contest shall come engage bravely, fight with
constancy, as knowing that you are fighting under the eyes of a present Lord, that you are
attaining by the confession of His name to His own glory; who is not such a one as that He
only looks on His servants, but He Himself also wrestles in us, Himself is engaged,—Himself
also in the struggles of our conflict not only crowns, but is crowned. But if before the day
of your contest, of the mercy of God, peace shall supervene, let there still remain to you the
sound will and the glorious conscience.2206 Nor let any one of you be saddened as if he were
inferior to those who before you have suffered tortures, have overcome the world and
trodden it under foot, and so have come to the Lord by a glorious road. For the Lord is the
“searcher out of the reins and the hearts.”2207 He looks through secret things, and beholds
that which is concealed. In order to merit the crown from Him, His own testimony alone
is sufficient, who will judge us. Therefore, beloved brethren, either case is equally lofty and
illustrious,—the former more secure, to wit, to hasten to the Lord with the consummation
of our victory,—the latter more joyous; a leave of absence, after glory, being received to

divine condescension illuminates, which in our own times the glorious blood of martyrs
renders illustrious! She was white before in the works of the brethren; now she has become
purple in the blood of the martyrs. Among her flowers are wanting neither roses nor lilies.
Now let each one strive for the largest dignity of either honour. Let them receive crowns,
either white, as of labours, or of purple, as of suffering. In the heavenly camp both peace
and strife have their own flowers, with which the soldier of Christ may be crowned for glory.

me in remembrance. Fare ye well.</p>

<head>Epistle IX.2208</head>
<p>To the Clergy, Concerning Certain Presbyters Who Had Rashly Granted Peace
to the Lapsed Before the Persecution Had Been Appeased, and Without the Privity
of the Bishops.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Argument of This Epistle is Contained in the Following Words of
the XIVth Epistle:—“To the Presbyters and Deacons,” He Says, “Was Not
Wanting the Vigour of the Priesthood, So that Some, Too Little Mindful of
Discipline, and Hasty with a Rash Precipitation, Who Had Already Begun to
Communicate with the Lapsed, Were Checked.”</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. I have long been patient,
beloved brethren, hoping that my forbearing silence would avail to quietness. But since the
unreasonable and reckless presumption of some is seeking by its boldness to disturb both
the honour of the martyrs, and the modesty of the confessors, and the tranquility of the
whole people, it behoves me no longer to keep silence, lest too much reticence should issue
in danger both to the people and to ourselves. For what danger ought we not to fear from
the Lord’s displeasure, when some of the presbyters, remembering neither the Gospel nor
their own place, and, moreover, considering neither the Lord’s future judgment nor the
bishop now placed over them, claim to themselves entire authority,2209—a thing which was
never in any wise done under our predecessors,—with discredit and contempt of the bishop?</p>
<p>2. And I wish, if it could be so without the sacrifice of our brethren’s safety, that they
could make good their claim to all things; I could dissemble and bear the discredit of my
episcopal authority, as I always have dissembled and borne it. But it is not now the occasion
for dissimulating when our brotherhood is deceived by some of you, who, while without
the means of restoring salvation they desire to please, become a still greater stumbling-block
to the lapsed. For that it is a very great crime which persecution has compelled to be committed,
they themselves know who have committed it; since our Lord and Judge has said,
“Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father which
is in heaven; but whosoever shall deny me, him will I also deny.”2210 And again He has said,
“All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies; but he that shall blaspheme
against the Holy Ghost shall not have forgiveness, but is guilty of eternal sin.”2211 Also the

<note type="footnote">2211 Mark iii. 28, 29.</note>

<pb n="720"/>
blessed apostle has said, “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils; ye
cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table and of the table of devils.”2212 He who withholds
these words from our brethren deceives them, wretched that they are; so that they who truly
repenting might satisfy God, both as the Father and as merciful, with their prayers and
works, are seduced more deeply to perish; and they who might raise themselves up fall the
more deeply. For although in smaller sins sinners may do penance for a set time, and according
to the rules of discipline come to public confession,2213 and by imposition of the hand
of the bishop and clergy receive the right of communion: now with their time still unfulfilled,
while persecution is still raging, while the peace of the Church itself is not yet restored, they
are admitted to communion, and their name is presented; and while the penitence is not
yet performed, confession is not yet made, the hands of the bishop and clergy are not yet
laid upon them, the eucharist is given to them; although it is written, “Whosoever shall eat
the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood
of the Lord.”2214</p>
<p>3. But now they are not guilty who so little observe the law of Scripture; but they will
be guilty who are in office and do not suggest these things to brethren, so that, being instructed
by those placed above them, they may do all things with the fear of God, and with the
observance given and prescribed by Him. Then, moreover, they lay the blessed martyrs open
to ill-will, and involve the glorious servants of God with the priest of God; so that although
they, mindful of my place, have directed letters to me, and have asked that their wishes
should then be examined, and peace granted them,—when our Mother, the Church herself,
should first have received peace for the Lord’s mercy, and the divine protection, have brought
me back to His Church,—yet these, disregarding the honour which the blessed martyrs with
the confessors maintain for me, despising the Lord’s law and that observance, which the
same martyrs and confessors bid to be maintained, before the fear of persecution is quenched,
before my return, almost even before the departure of the martyrs, communicate with the
lapsed, and offer and give them the eucharist: when even if the martyrs, in the heat of their
glory, were to consider less carefully the Scriptures, and to desire anything more, they should
be admonished by the presbyters’ and deacons’ suggestions, as was always done in time
past.2215</p>
<p>4. For this reason the divine rebuke does not cease to chastise us night nor day. For besides
the visions of the night, by day also, the innocent age of boys is among us filled with
the Holy Spirit, seeing in an ecstasy with their eyes, and hearing and speaking those things

whereby the Lord condescends to warn and instruct us.2216 And you shall hear all things
when the Lord, who bade me withdraw, shall bring me back again to you. In the meanwhile,
let those certain ones among you who are rash and incautious and boastful, and who do not
regard man, at least fear God, knowing that, if they shall persevere still in the same course,
I shall use that power of admonition which the Lord bids me use; so that they may meanwhile
be withheld from offering,2217 and have to plead their cause both before me and before the
confessors themselves and before the whole people, when, with God’s permission, we begin
to be gathered together once more into the bosom of the Church, our Mother. Concerning
this matter, I have written to the martyrs and confessors, and to the people, letters; both of
which I have bidden to be read to you. I wish you, dearly beloved brethren and earnestly
longed-for, ever heartily farewell in the Lord; and have me in remembrance. Fare ye well.</p>

<head>Epistle X.2218</head>
<p>To the Martyrs and Confessors Who Sought that Peace Should Be Granted to
the Lapsed.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Occasion of This Letter is Given Below in Epistle XIV. As Fol-
lows:—“When I Found that Those Who Had Polluted Their Hands and Mouths
with Sacrilegious Contact, or Had No Less Infected Their Conscience with
Wicked Certificates,” Etc.2219</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the martyrs and confessors, his beloved brethren, greeting. The anxiety
of my situation and the fear of the Lord constrain me, my brave and beloved brethren, to
admonish you in my letters, that those who so devotedly and bravely maintain the faith of
the Lord should also maintain the law and discipline of the Lord. For while it behoves all
Christ’s soldiers to keep the precepts of their commander; to you it is more especially fitting
that you should obey His precepts, inasmuch as you have been made an example to others,
both of valour and of the fear of God. And I had indeed believed that the presbyters and
deacons who are there present with you would admonish and instruct you more fully concerning
the law of the Gospel, as was the case always in time past under my predecessors;
so that the deacons passing in and out of the prison controlled the wishes of the martyrs by
their counsels, and by the Scripture precepts. But now, with great sorrow of mind, I gather
that not only the divine precepts are not suggested to you by them, but that they are even
rather restrained, so that those things which are done by you yourselves, both in respect of
God with caution, and in respect of God’s priest2220 with honour, are relaxed by certain
presbyters, who consider neither the fear of God nor the honour of the bishop. Although
you sent letters to me in which you ask that your wishes should be examined, and that peace
should be granted to certain of the lapsed as soon as with the end of the persecution we
should have begun to meet with our clergy, and to be gathered together once more; those
presbyters, contrary to the Gospel law, contrary also to your respectful petition, before
penitence was fulfilled, before confession even of the gravest and most heinous sin was
made, before hands were placed upon the repentant by the bishops and clergy, dare to offer
<note type="footnote">2218 Oxford ed.: Ep. xv. a.d. 250.</note>
<note type="footnote">2219 That these were everywhere soliciting the martyrs, and were also corrupting the confessors with importunate
and excessive entreaty, so that, without any distinction or examination of the individuals, thousands of
certificates were given, against the Gospel law, I wrote letters in which I recalled by my advice as much as possible
the martyrs and confessors to the Lord’s commands.</note>
<note type="footnote">2220 [Another instance of this word as applied to the bishop, κατ᾽ ἐξοχην. So in St. Chrysostom, De Sacerdotio

<pb n="723"/>
on their behalf, and to give them the eucharist, that is, to profane the sacred body of the
Lord, although it is written, “Whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.”2221</p>
<p>2. And to the lapsed indeed pardon may be granted in respect of this thing. For what
dead person would not hasten to be made alive? Who would not be eager to attain to his
own salvation? But it is the duty of those placed over them to keep the ordinance, and to
instruct those that are either hurrying or ignorant, that those who ought to be shepherds of
the sheep may not become their butchers. For to concede those things which tend to destruction
is to deceive. Nor is the lapsed raised in this manner, but, by offending God, he is more
urged on to ruin. Let them learn, therefore, even from you, what they ought to have taught;
let them reserve your petitions and wishes for the bishops,2222 and let them wait for ripe
and peaceable times to give peace at your requests. The first thing is, that the Mother should
first receive peace from the Lord, and then, in accordance with your wishes, that the peace
of her children should be considered.</p>
<p>3. And since I hear, most brave and beloved brethren, that you are pressed by the
shamelessness of some, and that your modesty suffers violence; I beg you with what entreaties
I may, that, as mindful of the Gospel, and considering what and what sort of things in past
time your predecessors the martyrs conceded, how careful they were in all respects, you also
should anxiously and cautiously weigh the wishes of those who petition you, since, as friends
of the Lord, and hereafter to exercise judgment with Him, you must inspect both the conduct
and the doings and the deserts of each one. You must consider also the kinds and qualities
of their sins, lest, in the event of anything being abruptly and unworthily either promised
by you or done by me, our Church2223 should begin to blush, even before the very Gentiles.
For we are visited and chastened frequently, and we are admonished, that the commandments
of the Lord may be kept without corruption or violation, which I find does not cease to be
the case there among you so as to prevent the divine judgment from instructing very many
of you also in the discipline of the Church. Now this can all be done, if you will regulate
those things that are asked of you with a careful consideration of religion, perceiving and
restraining those who, by accepting persons, either make favours in distributing your benefits,
or seek to make a profit of an unlawful trade.</p>
<p>4. Concerning this I have written both to the clergy and to the people, both of which
letters I have directed to be read to you. But you ought also to bring back and amend that
matter according to your diligence, in such a way as to designate those by name to whom

you desire that peace should be granted. For I hear that certificates are so given to some as
that it is said, “Let such a one be received to communion along with his friends,” which was
never in any case done by the martyrs so that a vague and blind petition should by and by
heap reproach upon us. For it opens a wide door to say, “Such a one with his friends;” and
twenty or thirty or more, may be presented to us, who may be asserted to be neighbours
and connections, and freedmen and servants, of the man who receives the certificate. And
for this reason I beg you that you will designate by name in the certificate those whom you
yourselves see, whom you have known, whose penitence you see to be very near to full satisfaction,
and so direct to us letters in conformity with faith and discipline. I bid you, very
brave and beloved brethren, ever heartily in the Lord farewell; and have me in remembrance.
Fare ye well.</p>

<head>Epistle XI.2224</head>
<p>To the People.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Substance of This Letter is Also Suggested in Epistle XIV, “Among
the People Also,” He Says, “I Have Done What I Could to Quiet Their Minds,
and Have Instructed Them to Be Retained in Ecclesiastical Discipline.”</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to his brethren among the people who stand fast,2225 greeting. That you bewail
and grieve over the downfall of our brethren I know from myself, beloved brethren, who
also bewail with you and grieve for each one, and suffer and feel what the blessed apostle
said: “Who is weak,” said he, “and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?”2226
And again he has laid it down in his epistle, saying, “Whether one member suffer, all the
members suffer with it; or one member rejoice, all the members rejoice with it.”2227 I sympathize
with you in your suffering and grief, therefore, for our brethren, who, having lapsed
and fallen prostrate under the severity of the persecution, have inflicted a like pain on us by
their wounds, inasmuch as they tear away part of our bowels with them,—to these the divine
mercy is able to bring healing. Yet I do not think that there must be any haste, nor that
anything must be done incautiously and immaturely, lest, while peace is grasped at, the divine
indignation be more seriously incurred. The blessed martyrs have written to me about certain
persons, requesting that their wishes may be examined into. When, as soon as peace is given
to us all by the Lord, we shall begin to return to the Church, then the wishes of each one
shall be looked into in your presence, and with your judgment.2228</p>
<p>2. Yet I hear that certain of the presbyters, neither mindful of the Gospel nor considering
what the martyrs have written to me, nor reserving to the bishop the honour of his priesthood
and of his dignity, have already begun to communicate with the lapsed, and to offer on their
behalf, and to give them the eucharist, when it was fitting that they should attain to these
things in due course. For, as in smaller sins which are not committed against God, penitence
may be fulfilled in a set time, and confession may be made with investigation of the life of
him who fulfils the penitence, and no one can come to communion unless the hands of the
bishop and clergy be first imposed upon him; how much more ought all such matters as
these to be observed with caution and moderation, according to the discipline of the Lord,
in these gravest and extremest sins! This warning, indeed, our presbyters and deacons ought

to have given you, that they might cherish the sheep committed to their care, and by the
divine authority might instruct them in the way of obtaining salvation by prayer. I am aware
of the peacefulness as well as the fear of our people, who would be watchful in the satisfaction
and the deprecation of God’s anger, unless some of the presbyters, by way of gratifying
them, had deceived them.</p>
<p>3. Even you, therefore, yourselves, guide them each one, and control the minds of the
lapsed by counsel and by your own moderation, according to the divine precepts. Let no
one pluck the unripe fruit at a time as yet premature. Let no one commit his ship, shattered
and broken with the waves, anew to the deep, before he has carefully repaired it. Let none
be in haste to accept and to put on a rent tunic, unless he has seen it mended by a skilful
workman, and has received it arranged by the fuller. Let them bear with patience my advice,
I beg. Let them look for my return, that when by God’s mercy I come to you, I, with many
of my co-bishops, being called together according to the Lord’s discipline,2229 and in the
presence of the confessors, and with your opinion also, may be able to examine the letters
and the wishes of the blessed martyrs. Concerning this matter I have written both to the
clergy and to the martyrs and confessors, both of which letters I have directed to be read to
you. I bid you, brethren beloved and most longed-for, ever heartily farewell in the Lord;
and have me in remembrance. Fare ye well.</p>

Whether of Their Own Accord, or by the Suggestion of Any Other, Broke Forth

Etc.2231</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. I marvel, beloved
brethren, that you have answered nothing to me in reply to my many letters which I have
frequently written to you, although as well the advantage as the need of our brotherhood
would certainly be best provided for if, receiving information from you, I could accurately
investigate and advise upon the management of affairs. Since, however, I see that there is
not yet any opportunity of coming to you, and that the summer has already begun—a season
that is disturbed with continual and heavy sicknesses,—I think that our brethren must be
dealt with;—that they who have received certificates from the martyrs, and may be assisted
by their privilege with God, if they should be seized with any misfortune and peril of sickness,
should, without waiting for my presence, before any presbyter who might be present, or if
a presbyter should not be found and death begins to be imminent, before even a deacon, be
able to make confession of their sin, that, with the imposition of hands upon them for repentance,
they should come to the Lord with the peace which the martyrs have desired, by
their letters to us, to be granted to them.2232</p>
<p>2. Cherish also by your presence the rest of the people who are lapsed, and cheer them
by your consolation, that they may not fail of the faith and of God’s mercy. For those shall
not be forsaken by the aid and assistance of the Lord, who meekly, humbly, and with true
penitence have persevered in good works; but the divine remedy will be granted to them
also. To the hearers2233 also, if there are any overtaken by danger, and placed near to death,

<p>To the Clergy, Concerning Those Who are in Haste to Receive Peace. a.d. 250.</p>
<p>Argument.—Peace Must Be Attained Through Penitence, and Penitence is Realized
by Keeping the Commandments. They Who are Oppressed with Sickness, If
They are Relieved by the Suffrages of the Martyrs, May Be Admitted to Peace;
But Others are to Be Kept Back Until the Peace of the Church is Secured.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. I have read your letter,
beloved brethren, wherein you wrote that your wholesome counsel was not wanting to our
brethren, that, laying aside all rash haste, they should manifest a religious patience to God,
so that when by His mercy we come together, we may debate upon all kinds of things, according
to the discipline of the Church, especially since it is written, “Remember from
whence thou hast fallen, and repent.”2236 Now he repents, who, remembering the divine
precept, with meekness and patience, and obeying the priests of God, deserves well of the
Lord by his obedience and his righteous works.</p>
<p>2. Since, however, you intimate that some are petulant, and eagerly urge their being received
to communion, and have desired in this matter that some rule should be given by
me to you, I think I have sufficiently written on this subject in the last letter that was sent
to you, that they who have received a certificate from the martyrs, and can be assisted by
their help with the Lord in respect of their sins, if they begin to be oppressed with any sickness
or risk; when they have made confession, and have received the imposition of hands on
them by you in acknowledgment of their penitence, should be remitted to the Lord with
the peace promised to them by the martyrs. But others who, without having received any
certificate from the martyrs, are envious2237 (since this is the cause not of a few, nor of one
church, nor of one province, but of the whole world), must wait, in dependence on the
protection of the Lord, for the public peace of the Church itself. For this is suitable to the
modesty and the discipline, and even the life of all of us, that the chief officers meeting together
with the clergy in the presence also of the people who stand fast, to whom themselves,
moreover, honour is to be shown for their faith and fear, we may be able to order all things
with the religiousness of a common consultation.2238 But how irreligious is it, and mischiev-

peace publicly.”</note>

ous, even to those themselves who are eager, that while such as are exiles, and driven from
their country, and spoiled of all their property, have not yet returned to the Church, some
of the lapsed should be hasty to anticipate even confessors themselves, and to enter into the
Church before them! If they are so over-anxious, they have what they require in their own
power, the times themselves offering them freely more than they ask. The struggle is still
going forward, and the strife is daily celebrated. If they truly and with constancy repent of
what they have done, and the fervour of their faith prevails, he who cannot be delayed may
be crowned.2239 I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and have me in remembrance.

<p>To the Presbyters and Deacons Assembled at Rome.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Gives an Account of His Withdrawal and of the Things Which He
Did Therein, Having Sent to Rome for His Justification, Copies of the Letters
Which He Had Written to His People; Nay, He Makes Use of the Same Words
Which He Had Employed in Them.2241</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to his brethren the presbyters and deacons assembled at Rome, greeting.
Having ascertained, beloved brethren, that what I have done and am doing has been told
to you in a somewhat garbled and untruthful manner, I have thought it necessary to write
this letter to you, wherein I might give an account to you of my doings, my discipline, and
my diligence; for, as the Lord’s commands teach, immediately the first burst of the disturbance
arose, and the people with violent clamour repeatedly demanded me, I, taking into
consideration not so much my own safety as the public peace of the brethren, withdrew for
a while, lest, by my over-bold presence, the tumult which had begun might be still further
provoked. Nevertheless, although absent in body, I was not wanting either in spirit, or in
act, or in my advice, so as to fail in any benefit that I could afford my brethren by my
counsel, according to the Lord’s precepts, in anything that my poor abilities enabled me.</p>
<p>2. And what I did, these thirteen letters sent forth at various times declare to you, which
I have transmitted to you; in which neither counsel to the clergy, nor exhortation to the
confessors, nor rebuke, when it was necessary, to the exiles, nor my appeals and persuasions
to the whole brotherhood, that they should entreat the mercy of God, were wanting to the
full extent that, according to the law of faith and the fear of God, with the Lord’s help, my
poor abilities could endeavour. But afterwards, when tortures came, my words reached both
to our tortured brethren and to those who as yet were only imprisoned with a view to torture,
to strengthen and console them. Moreover, when I found that those who had polluted their
hands and mouths with sacrilegious contact, or had no less infected their consciences with

as possible, the martyrs and confessors to the Lord’s commands. To the presbyters and

mindful of discipline, and hasty, with a rash precipitation, who had already begun to communicate
with the lapsed, were restrained by my interposition. Among the people, moreover,
I have done what I could to quiet their minds, and have instructed them to maintain ecclesiastical
discipline.</p>
<p>3. But afterwards, when some of the lapsed, whether of their own accord, or by the
suggestion of any other, broke forth with a daring demand, as though they would endeavour
by a violent effort to extort the peace that had been promised to them by the martyrs and
confessors; concerning this also I wrote twice to the clergy, and commanded it to be read
to them; that for the mitigation of their violence in any manner for the meantime, if any
who had received a certificate from the martyrs were departing from this life, having made
confession, and received the imposition of hands on them for repentance, they should be
remitted to the Lord with the peace promised them by the martyrs. Nor in this did I give
them a law, or rashly constitute myself the author of the direction; but as it seemed fit both
that honour should be paid to the martyrs, and that the vehemence of those who were
anxious to disturb everything should be restrained; and when, besides, I had read your letter
which you lately wrote hither to my clergy by Crementius the sub-deacon, to the effect that
assistance should be given to those who might, after their lapse, be seized with sickness, and
might penitently desire communion; I judged it well to stand by your judgment, lest our
proceedings, which ought to be united and to agree in all things, should in any respect be
different.2243 The cases of the rest, even although they might have received certificates from
the martyrs, I ordered altogether to be put off, and to be reserved till I should be present,
that so, when the Lord has given to us peace, and several bishops shall have begun to assemble
into one place, we may be able to arrange and reform everything, having the advantage also
of your counsel. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle XV.2244</head>
<p>To Moyses and Maximus, and the Rest of the Confessors.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Burden of This Letter is Given in Epistle XXXI. Below, Where the
Roman Clergy Say: “On Which Subject We Owe You, and Give You Our Deepest
and Abundant Thanks, that You Threw Light into the Gloom of Their Prison
by Your Letters.”2245</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Moyses and Maximus, the presbyters and the other confessors, his brethren,
greeting. Celerinus, a companion both of your faith and virtue, and God’s soldier in glorious
engagements, has come to me, beloved brethren, and represented all of you, as well as each
individual, forcibly to my affection. I beheld in him, when he came, the whole of you; and
when he spoke sweetly and often of your love to me, in his words I heard you. I rejoice very
greatly when such things are brought to me from you by such men as he. In a certain manner
I am also there with you in prison. I think that I who am thus bound to your hearts, enjoy
with you the delights of the divine approval. Your individual love associates me with your
honour; the Spirit does not allow our love to be separated. Confession2246 shuts you up in
prison; affection shuts me up there. And I indeed, remembering you day and night, both
when in the sacrifices I offer prayer with many, and when in retirement I pray with private
petition, beseech of the Lord a full acknowledgment to your crowns and your praises. But
my poor ability is too weak to recompense you; you give more when you remember me in
prayer, since, already breathing only celestial things, and meditating only divine things, you
ascend to loftier heights, even by the delay of your suffering; and by the long lapse of time,
are not wasting, but increasing your glory. A first and single confession makes blessed; you
confess as often as, when asked to retire from prison, you prefer the prison with faith and
virtue; your praises are as numerous as the days; as the months roll onward, ever your
merits increase. He conquers once who suffers at once; but he who continues always battling
with punishments, and is not overcome with suffering, is daily crowned.</p>
<note type="footnote">2244 Oxford ed.: Ep. xxxvii. In the autumn of a.d. 250.</note>
<note type="footnote">2245 “Further, that you came to them in such way as you could enter; that you refreshed their minds, robust
in their own faith and confession, by your appeals and your letters; that, accompanying their happiness with
deserved praises, you inflamed them to a much more ardent desire for heavenly glory; that you urged them
onward in the course; that you animated, as we believe and hope, future victors by the power of your address,
so that, although all this may seem to come from the faith of the confessors and the divine indulgence, yet in
their martyrdom they may seem in some manner to have become debtors to you.”</note>

<pb n="734"/>
<p>2. Now, therefore, let magistrates and consuls or proconsuls go by; let them glory in the
ensigns of their yearly dignity, and in their twelve fasces. Behold, the heavenly dignity in
you is sealed by the brightness of a year’s honour, and already, in the continuance of its
victorious glory, has passed over the rolling circle of the returning year. The rising sun and
the waning moon enlightened the world; but to you, He who made the sun and moon was
a greater light in your dungeon, and the brightness of Christ glowing in your hearts and
minds, irradiated with that eternal and brilliant light the gloom of the place of punishment,
which to others was so horrible and deadly. The winter has passed through the vicissitudes
of the months; but you, shut up in prison, were undergoing, instead of the inclemencies of
winter, the winter of persecution. To the winter succeeded the mildness of spring, rejoicing
with roses and crowned with flowers; but to you were present roses and flowers from the
delights of paradise, and celestial garlands wreathed your brows. Behold, the summer is
fruitful with the fertility of the harvest, and the threshing-floor is filled with grain; but you
who have sown glory, reap the fruit of glory, and, placed in the Lord’s threshing-floor, behold
the chaff burnt up with unquenchable fire; you yourselves as grains of wheat, winnowed
and precious corn, now purged and garnered, regard the dwelling-place of a prison as your
granary. Nor is there wanting to the autumn spiritual grace for discharging the duties of the
season. The vintage is pressed out of doors, and the grape which shall hereafter flow into
the cups is trodden in the presses. You, rich bunches out of the Lord’s vineyard, and branches
with fruit already ripe, trodden by the tribulation of worldly pressure, fill your wine-press
in the torturing prison, and shed your blood instead of wine; brave to bear suffering, you
willingly drink the cup of martyrdom. Thus the year rolls on with the Lord’s servants,—thus
is celebrated the vicissitude of the seasons with spiritual deserts, and with celestial rewards.</p>
<p>3. Abundantly blessed are they who, from your number, passing through these footprints
of glory, have already departed from the world; and, having finished their journey of virtue
and faith, have attained to the embrace and the kiss of the Lord, to the joy of the Lord
Himself. But yet your glory is not less, who are still engaged in contest, and, about to follow
the glories of your comrades, are long waging the battle, and with an unmoved and unshaken
faith standing fast, are daily exhibiting in your virtues a spectacle in the sight of God. The
longer is your strife, the loftier will be your crown. The struggle is one, but it is crowded
with a manifold multitude of contests; you conquer hunger, and despise thirst, and tread
under foot the squalor of the dungeon, and the horror of the very abode of punishment, by
the vigour of your courage. Punishment is there subdued; torture is worn out; death is not
feared but desired, being overcome by the reward of immortality, so that he who has
conquered is crowned with eternity of life. What now must be the mind in you, how elevated,
how large the heart, when such and so great things are resolved, when nothing but the precepts
of God and the rewards of Christ are considered! The will is then only God’s will; and

<pb n="735"/>
although you are still placed in the flesh, it is the life not of the present world, but of the future,
that you now live.</p>
<p>4. It now remains, beloved brethren, that you should be mindful of me; that, among
your great and divine considerations, you should also think of me in your mind and spirit;
and that I should be in your prayers and supplications, when that voice, which is illustrious
by the purification of confession, and praiseworthy for the continual tenor of its honour,
penetrates to God’s ears, and heaven being open to it, passes from these regions of the world
subdued, to the realms above, and obtains from the Lord’s goodness even what it asks. For
what do you ask from the Lord’s mercy which you do not deserve to obtain?—you who have
thus observed the Lord’s commands, who have maintained the Gospel discipline with the
simple vigour of your faith, who, with the glory of your virtue uncorrupted, have stood
bravely by the Lord’s commands, and by His apostles, and have confirmed the wavering
faith of many by the truth of your martyrdom? Truly, Gospel witnesses, and truly, Christ’s
martyrs, resting upon His roots, founded with strong foundation upon the Rock, you have
joined discipline with virtue, you have brought others to the fear of God, you have made
your martyrdoms, examples. I bid you, brethren, very brave and beloved, ever heartily
farewell; and remember me.</p>

<p>To the Presbyters and Deacons About the Foregoing and the Following Letters.</p>
<p>Argument.—No Account is to Be Made of Certificates from the Martyrs Before the
Peace of the Church is Restored.</p>
<p>Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. The Lord speaketh and
saith, “Upon whom shall I look, but upon him that is humble and quiet, and that trembleth
at my words?”2250 Although we ought all to be this, yet especially those ought to be so who
must labour, that, after their grave lapse, they may, by true penitence and absolute humility,
deserve well of the Lord. Now I have read the letter of the whole body of confessors, which
they wish to be made known by me to all my colleagues, and in which they requested that
the peace given by themselves should be assured to those concerning whom the account of
what they have done since their crime has been, in our estimation, satisfactory; which matter,
as it waits for the counsel and judgment of all of us,2251 I do not dare to prejudge, and so
to assume a common cause for my own decision. And therefore, in the meantime, let us
abide by the letters which I lately wrote to you, of which I have now sent a copy to many of
my colleagues,2252 who wrote in reply, that they were pleased with what I had decided, and
that there must be no departure therefrom, until, peace being granted to us by the Lord, we
shall be able to assemble together into one place, and to examine into the cases of individuals.
But that you may know both what my colleague Caldonius wrote to me, and what I replied
to him, I have enclosed with my letter a copy of each letter, the whole of which I beg you to
read to our brethren, that they may be more and more settled down to patience, and not
add another fault to what had hitherto been their former fault, not being willing to obey
either me or the Gospel, nor allowing their cases to be examined in accordance with the
letters of all the confessors. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and have me
in remembrance. Salute all the brotherhood. Fare ye well!</p>

<p>Caldonius to Cyprian.</p>
<p>Argument.—When, in the Urgency of a New Persecution, Certain of the Lapsed Had
Confessed Christ, and So, Before They Went Away into Exile, Sought for Peace,
Caldonius Consults Cyprian as to Whether Peace Should Be Granted Them.</p>
<p>Caldonius to Cyprian and his fellow-presbyters2254 abiding at Carthage, greeting. The
necessity of the times induces us not hastily to grant peace. But it was well to write to you,
that they2255 who, after having sacrificed,2256 were again tried, became exiles. And thus
they seem to me to have atoned for their former crime, in that they now let go their possessions
and homes, and, repenting, follow Christ. Thus Felix, who assisted in the office of
presbyter2257 under Decimus, and was very near to me in bonds (I knew that same Felix
very thoroughly), Victoria, his wife, and Lucius, being faithful, were banished, and have left
their possessions, which the treasury now has in keeping. Moreover, a woman, Bona by
name, who was dragged by her husband to sacrifice, and (with no conscience guilty of the
crime, but because those who held her hands, sacrificed) began to cry against them, “I did
not do it; you it was who did it!”—was also banished.2258 Since, therefore, all these were
asking for peace, saying, “We have recovered the faith which we had lost, we have repented,
and have publicly confessed Christ”—although it seems to me that they ought to receive
peace,—yet I have referred them to your judgment, that I might not appear to presume
anything rashly. If, therefore, you should wish me to do anything by the common decision,
write to me. Greet our brethren; our brethren greet you. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever
heartily farewell.</p>

<p>Cyprian Replies to Caldonius.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Treats of Nothing Peculiar in This Epistle, Beyond Acquiescing
in the Opinion of Caldonius, to Wit, that Peace Should Not Be Refused to Such
Lapsed As, by a True Repentance and Confession of the Name of Christ, Have
Deserved It, and Have Therefore Returned to Him.</p>
<p>Cyprian to Caldonius, his brother, greeting. We have received your letter, beloved
brother, which is abundantly sensible, and full of honesty and faith. Nor do we wonder that,
skilled and exercised as you are in the Scriptures of the Lord, you do everything discreetly
and wisely. You have judged quite correctly about granting peace to our brethren, which
they, by true penitence and by the glory of a confession of the Lord, have restored to themselves,
being justified by their words, by which before they had condemned themselves.
Since, then, they have washed away all their sin, and their former stain, by the help of the
Lord, has been done away by a more powerful virtue, they ought not to lie any longer under
the power of the devil, as it were, prostrate; when, being banished and deprived of all their
property, they have lifted themselves up and have begun to stand with Christ. And I wish
that the others also would repent after their fall, and be transferred into their former condition;
and that you may know how we have dealt with these, in their urgent and eager rashness
and importunity to extort peace, I have sent a book2260 to you, with letters to the number
of five, that I wrote to the clergy and to the people, and to the martyrs also and confessors,
which letters have already been sent to many of our colleagues, and have satisfied them; and
they replied that they also agree with me in the same opinion according to the Catholic faith;
which very thing do you also communicate to as many of our colleagues as you can, that
among all these, may be observed one mode of action and one agreement, according to the
Lord’s precepts.2261 I bid you, beloved brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<p>Celerinus to Lucian.</p>
<p>Argument.—Celerinus, on Behalf of His Lapsed Sisters at Rome, Beseeches Peace
from the Carthaginian Confessors.</p>
<p>1. Celerinus to Lucian, greeting. In writing this letter to you, my lord and brother, I
have been rejoicing and sorrowful,—rejoicing in that I had heard that you had been tried
on behalf of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour, and had confessed His name
in the presence of the magistrates of the world; but sorrowful, in that from the time when
I was in your company I have never been able to receive your letters. And now lately a
twofold sorrow has fallen upon me; that although you knew that Montanus, our common
brother, was coming to me from you out of the dungeon, you did not intimate anything to
me concerning your wellbeing, nor about anything that is done in connection with you.
This, however, continually happens to the servants of God, especially to those who are appointed
for the confession of Christ. For I know that every one looks not now to the things
that are of the world, but that he is hoping for a heavenly crown. Moreover, I said that perhaps
you had forgotten to write to me. For if from the lowest place I may be called by you yours,
or brother, if I should be worthy to hear myself named Celerinus; yet, when I also was in
such a purple2263 confession, I remembered my oldest brethren, and I took notice of them
in my letters, that their former love was still around me and mine. Yet I beseech, beloved
of the Lord, that if, first of all, you are washed in that sacred blood, and have suffered for
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ before my letters find you in this world, or should they
now reach you, that you would answer them to me. So may He crown you whose name you
have confessed. For I believe, that although in this world we do not see each other, yet in
the future we shall embrace one another in the presence of Christ. Entreat that I may be
worthy, even I, to be crowned along with your company.</p>
<p>2. Know, nevertheless, that I am placed in the midst of a great tribulation; and, as if you
were present with me, I remember your former love day and night, God only knows. And
therefore I ask that you will grant my desire, and that you will grieve with me at the (spiritual)
death of my sister, who in this time of devastation has fallen from Christ; for she has sacrificed
and provoked our Lord, as seems manifest to us. And for her deeds I in this day of paschal
rejoicing,2264 weeping day and night, have spent the days in tears, in sackcloth, and ashes,

and I am still spending them so to this day, until2265 the aid of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
affection manifested through you, or through those my lords who have been crowned, from
whom you are about to ask it, shall come to the help of so terrible a shipwreck. For I remember
your former love, that you will grieve with all the rest for our sisters whom you also
knew well—that is, Numeria and Candida,—for whose sin, because they have us as brethren,
we ought to keep watch. For I believe that Christ, according to their repentance and the
works which they have done towards our banished colleagues who came from you—by
whom themselves you will hear of their good works,—that Christ, I say, will have mercy
upon them, when you, His martyrs, beseech Him.</p>
<p>3. For I have heard that you have received the ministry of the purpled ones. Oh, happy
are you, even sleeping on the ground, to obtain your wishes which you have always desired!
You have desired to be sent into prison for His name’s sake, which now has come to pass;
as it is written, “The Lord grant thee according to thine own heart;”2266 and now made a
priest of God over them, and the same their minister has acknowledged it.2267 I ask, therefore
my lord, and I entreat by our Lord Jesus Christ, that you will refer the case to the rest of
your colleagues, your brethren, my lords, and ask from them, that whichever of you is first
crowned, should remit such a great sin to those our sisters, Numeria and Candida. For this
latter I have always called Etecusa2268—God is my witness,—because she gave gifts for
herself that she might not sacrifice; but she appears only to have ascended to the Tria Fata,2269
and thence to have descended. I know, therefore, that she has not sacrificed. Their cause
having been lately heard, the chief rulers2270 commanded them in the meantime to remain
as they are, until a bishop should be appointed.2271 But, as far as possible, by your holy
<note type="footnote">2265 The Oxford edition has a variation here, as follows: “Until our Lord Jesus Christ afford help, and pity
be manifested through you, or through those my lords who may have been crowned, from whom you will entreat

(we pray) that you would be indulgent in all these matters.</p>
<p>4. I entreat, therefore, beloved lord Lucian, be mindful of me, and acquiesce in my petition;
so may Christ grant you that sacred crown which he has given you not only in confession
but also in holiness, in which you have always walked and have always been an example to
the saints as well as a witness, that you will relate to all my lords, your brethren the confessors,
all about this matter, that they may receive help from you. For this, my lord and brother,
you ought to know, that it is not I alone who ask this on their behalf, but also Statius and
Severianus, and all the confessors who have come thence hither from you; to whom these
very sisters went down to the harbour2272 and took them up into the city, and they have
ministered to sixty-five, and even to this day have tended them in all things. For all are with
them. But I ought not to burden that sacred heart of yours any more, since I know that you
will labour with a ready will. Macharius, with his sisters Cornelia and Emerita, salute you,
rejoicing in your sanguinary confession, as well as in that of all the brethren, and Saturninus,
who himself also wrestled with the devil, who also bravely confessed the name of Christ,
who moreover, under the torture of the grappling claws, bravely confessed, and who also
strongly begs and entreats this. Your brethren Calphurnius and Maria, and all the holy
brethren, salute you. For you ought to know this too, that I have written also to my lords
your brethren letters, which I request that you will deign to read to them.</p>

<p>Lucian Replies to Celerinus.</p>
<p>Argument.—Lucian Assents to the Petition of Celerinus.</p>
<p>1. Lucian to Celerinus, his lord, and (if I shall be worthy to be called so) colleague in
Christ, greeting. I have received your letter, most dearly beloved lord and brother, in which
you have so laden me with expressions of kindness, that by reason of your so burdening me
I was almost overcome with such excessive joy; so that I exulted in reading, by the benefit
of your so great humility, the letter, which I also earnestly desired after so long a time to
read, in which you deigned to call me to remembrance, saying to me in your writing, “if I
may be worthy to be called your brother,” of a man such as I am who confessed the name
of God with trembling before the inferior magistrates. For you, by God’s will, when you
confessed, not only frightened back the great serpent himself, the pioneer of Antichrist,2274
(but) have conquered him, by that voice and those divine words, whereby I know how you
love the faith, and how zealous you are for Christ’s discipline, in which I know and rejoice
that you are actively occupied.2275 Now beloved, already to be esteemed among the martyrs,
you have wished to overload me with your letter, in which you told us concerning our sisters,
on whose behalf I wish that we could by possibility mention them without remembering
also so great a crime committed. Assuredly we should not then think of them with so many
tears as we do now.</p>
<p>2. You ought to know what has been done concerning us. When the blessed martyr
Paulus was still in the body, he called me and said to me: “Lucian, in the presence of Christ
I say to you, If any one, after my being called away, shall ask for peace from you, grant it in
my name.” Moreover, all of us whom the Lord has condescended in such tribulation to call
away, by our letters, by mutual agreement, have given peace to all. You see, then, brother,
how (I have done this) in part of what Paulus bade me, as what we in all cases decreed when
we were in this tribulation, wherein by the command of the emperor we were ordered to
be put to death by hunger and thirst, and were shut up in two cells, that so they might
weaken us by hunger and thirst. Moreover, the fire from the effect of our torture was so intolerable2276
that nobody could bear it. But now we have attained the brightness itself. And
therefore, beloved brother, greet Numeria and Candida, who (shall have peace2277) according

to the precept of Paulus, and the rest of the martyrs whose names I subjoin: viz., Bassus in
the dungeon of the perjured,2278 Mappalicus at the torture, Fortunio in prison, Paulus after
torture, Fortunata, Victorinus, Victor, Herennius, Julia, Martial, and Aristo, who by God’s
will were put to death in the prison by hunger, of whom in a few days you will hear of me
as a companion. For now there are eight days, from the day in which I was shut up again,
to the day in which I wrote my letter to you. For before these eight days, for five intervening
days, I received a morsel of bread and water by measure. And therefore, brother, as here,
since the Lord has begun to give peace to the Church itself, according to the precept of
Paulus, and our tractate, the case being set forth before the bishop, and confession being
made, I ask that not only these may have peace, but also (all) those whom you know to be
very near to our heart.</p>
<p>3. All my colleagues greet you. Do you greet the confessors of the Lord who are there
with you, whose names you have intimated, among whom also are Saturninus, with his
companions, but who also is my colleague, and Maris, Collecta, and Emerita, Calphurnius
and Maria, Sabina, Spesina, and the sisters, Januaria, Dativa, Donata. We greet Saturus with
his family, Bassianus and all the clergy, Uranius, Alexius, Quintianus, Colonica, and all
whose names I have not written, because I am already weary. Therefore they must pardon
me. I bid you heartily farewell, and Alexius, and Getulicus, and the money-changers, and
the sisters. My sisters Januaria and Sophia, whom I commend to you, greet you.2279</p>

<head>Epistle XXII.2280</head>
<p>To the Clergy Abiding at Rome, Concerning Many of the Confessors, and Concerning
the Forwardness of Lucian and the Modesty of Celerinus the Confessor.</p>
<p>Argument.—In This Letter Cyprian Informs the Roman Clergy of the Seditious Demand
of the Lapsed to Be Restored to Peace, and of the Forwardness of Lucian.
In Order that They May Better Understand These Matters, Cyprian Takes Care
that Not Only His Own Letters, But Also Those of Celerinus and Lucian, Should
Be Sent to Them.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons abiding at Rome, his brethren, greeting. After
the letters that I wrote to you, beloved brethren, in which what I had done was explained,
and some slight account was given of my discipline and diligence, there came another
matter which, any more than the others, ought not to be concealed from you. For our
brother Lucian, who himself also is one of the confessors, earnest indeed in faith, and robust
in virtue, but little established in the reading of the Lord’s word, has attempted certain things,
constituting himself for a time an authority for unskilled people, so that certificates written
by his hand were given indiscriminately to many persons in the name of Paulus; whereas
Mappalicus the martyr, cautious and modest, mindful of the law and discipline, wrote no
letters contrary to the Gospel, but only, moved with domestic affection for his mother,2281
who had fallen, commanded peace to be given to her. Saturninus, moreover, after his torture,
still remaining in prison, sent out no letters of this kind. But Lucian, not only while Paulus
was still in prison, gave everywhere in his name certificates written with his own hand, but
even after his decease persisted in doing the same things under his name, saying that this
had been commanded him by Paulus, ignorant that he must obey the Lord rather than his
fellow-servant. In the name also of Aurelius, a young man who had undergone the torture,
many certificates were given, written by the hand of the same Lucian, because Aurelius did
not know how to write himself.</p>
<p>2. In order, in some measure, to put a stop to this practice, I wrote letters to them, which
I have sent to you under the enclosure of the former letter, in which I did not fail to ask and
persuade them that consideration might be had for the law of the Lord and the Gospel. But
after I sent my letters to them, that, as it were, something might be done more moderately
and temperately; the same Lucian wrote a letter in the name of all the confessors, in which
well nigh every bond of faith, and fear of God, and the Lord’s command, and the sacredness
and sincerity of the Gospel were dissolved. For he wrote in the name of all, that they had
<note type="footnote">2280 Oxford ed.: Ep. xxvii. a.d. 250.</note>
<note type="footnote">2281 Some read, “his mother and sisters, who had fallen.”</note>

<pb n="746"/>
given peace to all, and that he wished that this decree should be communicated through me
to the other bishops, of which letter I transmitted a copy to you. It was added indeed, “of
whom the account of what they have done since their crime has been satisfactory;”—a thing
this which excites a greater odium against me, because I, when I have begun to hear the
cases of each one and to examine into them, seem to deny to many what they now are all
boasting that they have received from the martyrs and confessors.</p>
<p>3. Finally, this seditious practice has already begun to appear; for in our province,
through some of its cities, an attack has been made by the multitude upon their rulers, and
they have compelled that peace to be given to them immediately which they all cried out
had been once given to them by the martyrs and confessors. Their rulers, being frightened
and subdued, were of little avail to resist them, either by vigour of mind or by strength of
faith. With us, moreover, some turbulent spirits, who in time past were with difficulty governed
by me, and were delayed till my coming, were inflamed by this letter as if by a firebrand,
and began to be more violent, and to extort the peace granted to them. I have sent a copy
to you of the letters that I wrote to my clergy about these matters, and, moreover, what
Caldonius, my colleague, of his integrity and faithfulness wrote, and what I replied to him.
I have sent both to you to read. Copies also of the letter of Celerinus, the good and stout
confessor, which he wrote to Lucian the same confessor—also what Lucian replied to him,—I
have sent to you; that you may know both my labour in respect of everything, and my diligence,
and might learn the truth itself, how moderate and cautious is Celerinus the confessor,
and how reverent both in his humility and fear for our faith; while Lucian, as I have said, is
less skilful concerning the understanding of the Lord’s word, and by his facility, is mischievous
on account of the dislike that he causes for my reverential dealing. For while the Lord
has said that the nations are to be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost, and their past sins are to be done away in baptism; this man, ignorant
of the precept and of the law, commands peace to be granted and sins to be done away in
the name of Paulus; and he says that this was commanded him by Paulus, as you will observe
in the letter sent by the same Lucian to Celerinus, in which he very little considered that it
is not martyrs that make the Gospel, but that martyrs are made by the Gospel;2282 since
Paul also, the apostle whom the Lord called a chosen vessel unto Him, laid down in his
epistle: “I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you into the grace of
Christ, unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and
would pervert the Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any
other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As
we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that
ye have received, let him be accursed.”2283</p>

<pb n="747"/>
<p>4. But your letter, which I received, written to my clergy, came opportunely; as also did
those which the blessed confessors, Moyses and Maximus, Nicostratus, and the rest, sent
to Saturninus and Aurelius, and the others, in which are contained the full vigour of the
Gospel and the robust discipline of the law of the Lord. Your words much assisted me as I
laboured here, and withstood with the whole strength of faith the onset of ill-will, so that
my work was shortened from above, and that before the letters which I last sent you reached
you, you declared to me, that according to the Gospel law, your judgment also strongly and
unanimously concurred with mine. I bid you, brethren, beloved and longed-for, ever
heartily farewell.</p>

<p>To the Clergy, on the Letters Sent to Rome, and About the Appointment of Saturus
as Reader, and Optatus as Sub-Deacon. a.d. 250.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Clergy are Informed by This Letter of the Ordination of Saturus
and Optatus, and What Cyprian Had Written to Rome.</p>
<p>Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. That nothing may be
unknown to your consciousness, beloved brethren, of what was written to me and what I
replied, I have sent you a copy of each letter, and I believe that my rejoinder will not displease
you. But I ought to acquaint you in my letter concerning this, that for a very urgent reason
I have sent a letter to the clergy who abide in the city. And since it behoved me to write by
clergy, while I know that very many of ours are absent, and the few that are there are hardly
sufficient for the ministry of the daily duty, it was necessary to appoint some new ones, who
might be sent. Know, then, that I have made Saturus a reader, and Optatus, the confessor,
a sub-deacon; whom already, by the general advice, we had made next to the clergy, in
having entrusted to Saturus on Easter-day, once and again, the reading; and when with the
teacher-presbyters2285 we were carefully trying readers—in appointing Optatus from among
the readers to be a teacher of the hearers;—examining, first of all, whether all things were
found fitting in them, which ought to be found in such as were in preparation for the clerical
office. Nothing new, therefore, has been done by me in your absence; but what, on the
general advice of all of us had been begun, has, upon urgent necessity, been accomplished.
I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and remember me. Fare ye well.</p>

<head>Epistle XXIV.2286</head>
<p>To Moyses and Maximus and the Rest of the Confessors.</p>
<p>Argument.—This Letter is One of Congratulation to the Roman Confessors.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Moyses and Maximus, the presbyters, and to the other confessors, his very
beloved brethren, greeting. I had already known from rumour, most brave and blessed
brethren, the glory of your faith and virtue, rejoicing greatly and abundantly congratulating
you, that the highest condescension of our Lord Jesus Christ should have prepared you for
the crown by confession of His name. For you, who have become chiefs and leaders in the
battle of our day, have set forward the standard of the celestial warfare; you have made a
beginning of the spiritual contest which God has purposed to be now waged by your valour;
you, with unshaken strength and unyielding firmness, have broken the first onset of the
rising war. Thence have arisen happy openings of the fight; thence have begun good auspices
of victory. It happened that here martyrdoms were consummated by tortures. But he who,
preceding in the struggle, has been made an example of virtue to the brethren, is on common
ground with the martyrs in honour. Hence you have delivered to us garlands woven by your
hand, and have pledged your brethren from the cup of salvation.</p>
<p>2. To these glorious beginnings of confession and the omens of a victorious warfare,
has been added the maintenance of discipline, which I observed from the vigour of your
letter that you lately sent to your colleagues joined with you to the Lord in confession, with
anxious admonition, that the sacred precepts of the Gospel and the commandments of life
once delivered to us should be kept with firm and rigid observance. Behold another lofty
degree of your glory; behold, with confession, a double title to deserving well of God,—to
stand with a firm step, and to drive away in this struggle, by the strength of your faith, those
who endeavour to make a breach in the Gospel, and bring impious hands to the work of
undermining the Lord’s precepts:—to have before afforded the indications of courage, and
now to afford lessons of life. The Lord, when, after His resurrection, He sent forth His
apostles, charges them, saying, “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you.”2287 And the Apostle John, remembering this charge, subsequently lays it down in his
epistle: “Hereby,” says he, “we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.
He that saith he knoweth Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth

is not in him.”2288 You prompt the keeping of these precepts; you observe the divine and
heavenly commands. This is to be a confessor of the Lord; this is to be a martyr of Christ,—to
keep the firmness of one’s profession inviolate among all evils, and secure. 2289For to wish
to become a martyr for the Lord, and to try to overthrow the Lord’s precepts; to use against
Him the condescension that He has granted you;—to become, as it were, a rebel with arms
that you have received from Him;—this is to wish to confess Christ, and to deny Christ’s
Gospel. I rejoice, therefore, on your behalf, most brave and faithful brethren; and as much
as I congratulate the martyrs there honoured for the glory of their strength, so much do I
also equally congratulate you for the crown of the Lord’s discipline. The Lord has shed forth
His condescension in manifold kinds of liberality. He has distributed the praises of good
soldiers and their spiritual glories in plentiful variety. We also are sharers in your honour;
we count your glory our glory, whose times have been brightened by such a felicity, that it
should be the fortune of our day to see the proved servants of God and Christ’s soldiers
crowned. I bid you, most brave and blessed brethren, ever heartily farewell; and remember
me.</p>

<head>Epistle XXV.2290</head>
<p>Moyses, Maximus, Nicostratus, and the Other Confessors Answer the Foregoing
Letter. a.d. 250.</p>
<p>Argument.—They Gratefully Acknowledge the Consolation Which the Roman
Confessors Had Received from Cyprian’s Letter. Martyrdom is Not a Punishment,
But a Happiness. The Words of the Gospel are Brands to Inflame Faith.
In the Case of the Lapsed, the Judgment of Cyprian is Acquiesced in.</p>
<p>1. To Cæcilius Cyprian, bishop of the church of the Carthaginians, Moyses and Maximus,
presbyters, and Nicostratus and Rufinus, deacons, and the other confessors persevering in
the faith of the truth, in God the Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, and in the
Holy Spirit, greeting. Placed, brother, as we are among various and manifold sorrows, on
account of the present desolations of many brethren throughout almost the whole world,2291
this chief consolation has reached us, that we have been lifted up by the receipt of your letter,
and have gathered some alleviation for the griefs of our saddened spirit. From which we
can already perceive that the grace of divine providence wished to keep us so long shut up
in the prison chains, perhaps for no other reason than that, instructed and more vigorously
animated by your letter, we might with a more earnest will attain to the destined crown. For
your letter has shone upon us as a calm in the midst of a tempest, and as the longed-for
tranquillity in the midst of a troubled sea, and as repose in labours, as health in dangers and
pains, as in the densest darkness, the bright and glowing light. Thus we drank it up with a
thirsty spirit, and received it with a hungry desire; so that we rejoice to find ourselves by it
sufficiently fed and strengthened for encounter with the foe. The Lord will reward you for
that love of yours, and will restore you the fruit due to this so good work; for he who exhorts
is not less worthy of the reward of the crown than he who suffers; not less worthy of praise
is he who has taught, than he who has acted also; he is not less to be honoured who has
warned, than he who has fought; except that sometimes the weight of glory more redounds
to him who trains, than to him who has shown himself a teachable learner; for the latter,
perchance, would not have had what he has practised, unless the former had taught him.</p>
<p>2. Therefore, again, we say, brother Cyprian, we have received great joy, great comfort,
great refreshment, especially in that you have described, with glorious and deserved praises,
the glorious, I will not say, deaths, but immortalities of martyrs. For such departures should
have been proclaimed with such words, that the things which were related might be told in
<note type="footnote">2290 Oxford ed.: Ep. xxxi. [This epistle shows that Cyprian’s gentle reproof of their former implied regret at
his retreat (see p. 280, supra) had been effective.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2291 [Note this testimony to the universality of the persecution. Vol. iv. p. 125, this series.]</note>

<pb n="752"/>
such manner as they were done. Thus, from your letter, we saw those glorious triumphs of
the martyrs; and with our eyes in some sort have followed them as they went to heaven, and
have contemplated them seated among angels, and the powers and dominions of heaven.
Moreover, we have in some manner perceived with our ears the Lord giving them the
promised testimony in the presence of the Father. It is this, then, which also raises our
spirit day by day, and inflames us to the following of the track of such dignity.</p>
<p>3. For what more glorious, or what more blessed, can happen to any man from the divine
condescension, than to confess the Lord God, in death itself, before his very executioners?
Than among the raging and varied and exquisite tortures of worldly power, even when the
body is racked and torn and cut to pieces, to confess Christ the Son of God with a spirit still
free, although departing? Than to have mounted to heaven with the world left behind? Than,
having forsaken men, to stand among the angels? Than, all worldly impediments being
broken through, already to stand free in the sight of God? Than to enjoy the heavenly
kingdom without any delay? Than to have become an associate of Christ’s passion in Christ’s
name? Than to have become by the divine condescension the judge of one’s own judge?
Than to have brought off an unstained conscience from the confession of His name? Than
to have refused to obey human and sacrilegious laws against the faith? Than to have borne
witness to the truth with a public testimony? Than, by dying, to have subdued death itself,
which is dreaded by all? Than, by death itself, to have attained immortality? Than when
torn to pieces, and tortured by all the instruments of cruelty, to have overcome the torture
by the tortures themselves? Than by strength of mind to have wrestled with all the agonies
of a mangled body? Than not to have shuddered at the flow of one’s own blood? Than to
have begun to love one’s punishments, after having faith to bear them?2292 Than to think
it an injury to one’s life not to have left it?</p>
<p>4. For to this battle our Lord, as with the trumpet of His Gospel, stimulates us when He
says, “He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth
his own soul more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth
after me, is not worthy of me.”2293 And again, “Blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed shall ye be, when men
shall persecute you, and hate you. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for so did their fathers
persecute the prophets which were before you.”2294 And again, “Because ye shall stand before
kings and powers, and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the
son, and he that endureth to the end shall be saved;”2295 and “To him that overcometh will
<note type="footnote">2292 Supplicia sua post fidem amare coepisse.</note>
<note type="footnote">2293 Matt. x. 37, 38.</note>

<note type="footnote">2295 Matt. x. 18; xxi. 22.</note>

<pb n="753"/>
I give to sit on my throne, even as I also overcame and am set down on the throne of my
Father.”2296 Moreover the apostle: “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall
tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is
written, For thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the
slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors for Him who hath loved
us.”2297</p>
<p>5. When we read these things,2298 and things of the like kind, brought together in the
Gospel, and feel, as it were, torches placed under us, with the Lord’s words to inflame our
faith, we not only do not dread, but we even provoke2299 the enemies of the truth; and we
have already conquered the opponents of God, by the very fact of our not yielding to them,
and have subdued their nefarious laws against the truth. And although we have not yet shed
our blood, we are prepared to shed it. Let no one think that this delay of our departure2300
is any clemency; for it obstructs us, it makes a hindrance to our glory, it puts off heaven, it
withholds the glorious sight of God. For in a contest of this kind, and in the kind of contest
when faith is struggling in the encounter, it is not true clemency to put off martyrs by delay.
Entreat therefore, beloved Cyprian, that of His mercy the Lord will every day more and
more arm and adorn every one of us with greater abundance and readiness, and will confirm
and strengthen us by the strength of His power; and, as a good captain, will at length bring
forth His soldiers, whom He has hitherto trained and proved in the camp of our prison, to
the field of the battle set before them. May He hold forth to us the divine arms, those weapons
that know not how to be conquered,—the breastplate of righteousness, which is never accustomed
to be broken,—the shield of faith, which cannot be pierced through,—the helmet
of salvation, which cannot be shattered,—and the sword of the Spirit, which has never been
wont to be injured. For to whom should we rather commit these things for him to ask for
us, than to our so reverend bishop,2301 as destined victims asking help of the priest?</p>
<p>6. Behold another joy of ours, that, in the duty of your episcopate, although in the
meantime you have been, owing to the condition of the times, divided from your brethren,
you have frequently confirmed the confessors by your letters; that you have ever afforded
necessary supplies from your own just acquisitions; that in all things you have always shown
yourself in some sense present; that in no part of your duty have you hung behind as a
deserter.2302 But what more strongly stimulated us to a greater joy we cannot be silent upon,

but must describe with all the testimony of our voice. For we observe that you have both
rebuked with fitting censure, and worthily, those who, unmindful of their sins, had, with
hasty and eager desire, extorted peace from the presbyters in your absence, and those who,
without respect for the Gospel, had with profane facility granted the holiness2303of the Lord
unto dogs, and pearls to swine; although a great crime, and one which has extended with
incredible destructiveness almost over the whole earth, ought only, as you yourself write,
to be treated cautiously and with moderation, with the advice of all the bishops, presbyters,
deacons, confessors, and even the laymen who abide fast,2304 as in your letters you yourself
also testify; so that, while wishing unseasonably to bring repairs to the ruins, we may not
appear to be bringing about other and greater destruction, for where is the divine word left,
if pardon be so easily granted to sinners? Certainly their spirits are to be cheered and to be
nourished up to the season of their maturity, and they are to be instructed from the Holy
Scriptures how great and surpassing a sin they have committed. Nor let them be animated
by the fact that they are many, but rather let them be checked by the fact that they are not
few.2305 An unblushing number has never been accustomed to have weight in extenuation
of a crime; but shame, modesty, patience, discipline, humility, and subjection, waiting for
the judgment of others upon itself, and bearing the sentence of others upon its own judgment,—
this it is which proves penitence; this it is which skins over a deep wound; this it is
which raises up the ruins of the fallen spirit and restores them, which quells and restrains
the burning vapour of their raging sins. For the physician will not give to the sick the food
of healthy bodies, lest the unseasonable nourishment, instead of repressing, should stimulate
the power of the raging disease,—that is to say, lest what might have been sooner diminished
by abstinence, should, through impatience, be prolonged by growing indigestion.</p>
<p>7. Hands, therefore, polluted with impious sacrifices2306 must be purified with good
works, and wretched mouths defiled with accursed food2307 must be purged with words of
true penitence, and the spirit must be renewed and consecrated in the recesses of the faithful
heart. Let the frequent groanings of the penitents be heard; let faithful tears be shed from
the eyes not once only, but again and again, so that those very eyes which wickedly looked
upon idols may wash away, with tears that satisfy God, the unlawful things that they had
done. Nothing is necessary for diseases but patience: they who are weary and weak wrestle
with their pain; and so at length hope for health, if, by tolerating it, they can overcome their
suffering; for unfaithful is the scar which the physician has too quickly produced; and the

healing is undone by any little casualty, if the remedies be not used faithfully from their very
slowness. The flame is quickly recalled again to a conflagration, unless the material of the
whole fire be extinguished even to the extremest spark; so that men of this kind should justly
know that even they themselves are more advantaged by the very delay, and that more trusty
remedies are applied by the necessary postponement. Besides, where shall it be said that
they who confess Christ are shut up in the keeping of a squalid prison, if they who have
denied Him are in no peril of their faith? Where, that they are bound in the cincture of
chains in God’s name, if they who have not kept the confession of God are not deprived of
communion? Where, that the imprisoned martyrs lay down their glorious lives, if those
who have forsaken the faith do not feel the magnitude of their dangers and their sins? But
if they betray too much impatience, and demand communion with intolerable eagerness,
they vainly utter with petulant and unbridled tongues those querulous and invidious reproaches
which avail nothing against the truth, since they might have retained by their own
right what now by a necessity, which they of their own free will have sought, they are compelled
to sue for.2308 For the faith which could confess Christ, could also have been kept by
Christ in communion. We bid you, blessed and most glorious father, ever heartily farewell
in the Lord; and have us in remembrance.</p>

<head>Epistle XXVI.2309</head>
<p>Cyprian to the Lapsed.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Argument of This Letter is Found Below in Letter XXVII. “They
Wrote to Me,” Says He, “Not Asking that Peace Should Be Granted Them, But
Claiming It for Themselves as Already Granted, Because They Say that Paulus
Has Given Peace to All; As You Will Read in Their Letter of Which I Have Sent
You a Copy, Together with What I Briefly Replied to Them.” But the Letter of
the Lapsed to Which He Replies is Wanting.</p>
<p>1. Our Lord, whose precepts and admonitions we ought to observe, describing the
honour of a bishop2310 and the order of His Church, speaks in the Gospel, and says to Peter:
“I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church; and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever
thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”2311 Thence, through the changes of
times and successions, the ordering of bishops and the plan of the Church flow onwards;
so that the Church is founded upon the bishops, and every act of the Church is controlled
by these same rulers.2312 Since this, then, is founded on the divine law, I marvel that some,
with daring temerity, have chosen to write to me as if they wrote in the name of the Church;
when the Church is established in the bishop and the clergy, and all who stand fast in the
faith. For far be it from the mercy of God and His uncontrolled might to suffer the number
of the lapsed to be called the Church; since it is written, “God is not the God of the dead,
but of the living.”2313 For we indeed desire that all may be made alive; and we pray that, by
our supplications and groans, they may be restored to their original state. But if certain
lapsed ones claim to be the Church, and if the Church be among them and in them, what
is left but for us to ask of these very persons that they would deign to admit us into the
Church? Therefore it behoves them to be submissive and quiet and modest, as those who
ought to appease God, in remembrance of their sin, and not to write letters in the name of
the Church, when they should rather be aware that they are writing to the Church.</p>

<p>2. But some who are of the lapsed have lately written to me, and are humble and meek
and trembling and fearing God, and who have always laboured in the Church gloriously
and liberally, and who have never made a boast of their labour to the Lord, knowing that
He has said, “When ye shall have done all these things, say, We are unprofitable servants:
we have done that which was our duty to do.”2314 Thinking of which things, and although
they had received certificates from the martyrs, nevertheless, that their satisfaction might
be admitted by the Lord, these persons beseeching have written to me that they acknowledge
their sin, and are truly repentant, and do not hurry rashly or importunately to secure peace;
but that they are waiting for my presence, saying that even peace itself, if they should receive
it when I was present, would be sweeter to them. How greatly I congratulate these, the Lord
is my witness, who hath condescended to tell what such, and such sort of servants deserve
of His kindness. Which letters, as I lately received, and now read that you have written very
differently, I beg that you will discriminate between your wishes; and whoever you are who
have sent this letter, add your names to the certificate, and transmit the certificate to me
with your several names. For I must first know to whom I have to reply; then I will respond
to each of the matters that you have written, having regard to the mediocrity of my place
and conduct. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell, and live quietly and tranquilly
according to the Lord’s discipline. Fare ye well.</p>

<head>Epistle XXVII.2315</head>
<p>To the Presbyters and Deacons.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Argument of This Letter is Sufficiently in Agreement with the
Preceding, and It Appears that It is the One of Which He Speaks in the Following
Letter; For He Praises His Clergy for Having Rejected from Communion Gaius
of Didda, a Presbyter, and His Deacon, Who Rashly Communicated with the
Lapsed; And Exhorts Them to Do the Same with Certain Others.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. You have done uprightly
and with discipline, beloved brethren, that, by the advice of my colleagues who were present,
you have decided not to communicate with Gaius the presbyter of Didda, and his deacon;
who, by communicating with the lapsed, and offering their oblations,2316 have been frequently
taken in their wicked errors; and who once and again, as you wrote to me, when
warned by my colleagues not to do this, have persisted obstinately, in their presumption
and audacity, deceiving certain brethren also from among our people, whose benefit we
desire with all humility to consult, and whose salvation we take care for, not with affected
adulation, but with sincere faith, that they may supplicate the Lord with true penitence and
groaning and sorrow, since it is written, “Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent.”
2317 And again, the divine Scripture says, “Thus saith the Lord, When thou shalt be
converted and lament, then thou shalt be saved, and shalt know where thou hast been.”2318</p>
<p>2. Yet how can those mourn and repent, whose groanings and tears some of the presbyters
obstruct when they rashly think that they may be communicated with, not knowing
that it is written, “They who call you happy2319 cause you to err, and destroy the path of
your feet?”2320 Naturally, our wholesome and true counsels have no success, whilst the
salutary truth is hindered by mischievous blandishments and flatteries, and the wounded
and unhealthy mind of the lapsed suffers what those also who are bodily diseased and sick
often suffer; that while they refuse wholesome food and beneficial drink as bitter and distasteful,
and crave those things which seem to please them and to be sweet for the present,
they are inviting to themselves mischief and death by their recklessness and intemperance.

Nor does the true remedy of the skilful physician avail to their safety, whilst the sweet enticement
is deceiving with its charms.</p>
<p>3. Do you, therefore, according to my letters, take counsel about this faithfully and
wholesomely, and do not recede from better counsels; and be careful to read these same
letters to my colleagues also, if there are any present, or if any should come to you; that,
with unanimity and concord, we may maintain a healthful plan for soothing and healing
the wounds of the lapsed, intending to deal very fully with all when, by the Lord’s mercy,
we shall begin to assemble together. In the meantime, if any unrestrained and impetuous
person, whether of our presbyters or deacons or of strangers, should dare, before our decree,
to communicate with the lapsed, let him be expelled from our communion, and plead the
cause of his rashness before all of us when, by the Lord’s permission, we shall assemble together
again.2321 Moreover, you wished me to reply what I thought concerning Philumenus
and Fortunatus, sub-deacons, and Favorinus, an acolyte, who retired in the midst of the
time of trial, and have now returned. Of which thing I cannot make myself sole judge, since
many of the clergy are still absent, and have not considered, even thus late, that they should
return to their place; and this case of each one must be considered separately and fully investigated,
not only with my colleagues, but also with the whole of the people themselves.2322
For a matter which hereafter may constitute an example as regards the ministers of the
Church must be weighed and adjudged with careful deliberation. In the meanwhile, let them
only abstain from the monthly division,2323 not so as to seem to be deprived of the ministry
of the Church, but that all matters being in a sound state, they may be reserved till my
coming. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell. Greet all the brotherhood, and
fare ye well.</p>

<p>To the Presbyters and Deacons Abiding at Rome.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Roman Clergy are Informed of the Temerity of the Lapsed Who
Were Demanding Peace.</p>
<p>Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons abiding at Rome, his brethren, greeting. Both
our common love and the reason of the thing demand, beloved brethren, that I should keep
back from your knowledge nothing of those matters which are transacted among us, that
so we may have a common plan for the advantage of the administration of the Church. For
after I wrote to you the letter which I sent by Saturus the reader, and Optatus the sub-deacon,
the combined temerity of certain of the lapsed, who refuse to repent and to make satisfaction
to God, wrote to me, not asking that peace might be given to them, but claiming it as already
given; because they say that Paulus has given peace to all, as you will read in their letter of
which I have sent you a copy, as well as what I briefly replied to them in the meantime. But
that you may also know what sort of a letter I afterwards wrote to the clergy, I have, moreover,
sent you a copy of this. But if, after all, their temerity should not be repressed either by my
letters or by yours, and should not yield to wholesome counsels, I shall take such proceedings
as the Lord, according to His Gospel, has enjoined to be taken. I bid you, beloved brethren,
ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle XXIX.2325</head>
<p>The Presbyters and Deacons Abiding at Rome, to Cyprian.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Roman Church Declares Its Judgment Concerning the Lapsed to
Be in Agreement with the Carthaginian Decrees. Any Indulgence Shown to the
Lapsed is Required to Be in Accordance with the Law of the Gospel. That the
Peace Granted by the Confessors Depends Only Upon Grace and Good-Will, is
Manifest from the Fact that the Lapsed are Referred to the Bishops. The Seditious
Demand for Peace Made by Felicissimus is to Be Attributed to Faction.</p>
<p>1. The presbyters and deacons abiding at Rome, to Father2326 Cyprian, greeting. When,
beloved brother, we carefully read your letter which you had sent by Fortunatus the subdeacon,
we were smitten with a double sorrow, and disordered with a twofold grief, that
there was not any rest given to you in such necessities of the persecution, and that the unreasonable
petulance of the lapsed brethren was declared to be carried even to a dangerous
boldness of expression. But although those things which we have spoken of severely afflicted
us and our spirit, yet your rigour and the severity that you have used, according to the
proper discipline, moderates the so heavy load of our grief, in that you rightly restrain the
wickedness of some, and, by your exhortation to repentance, show the legitimate way of
salvation. That they should have wished to hurry to such an extreme as this, we are indeed
considerably surprised; as that with such urgency, and at so unseasonable and bitter a time,
being in so great and excessive a sin, they should not so much ask for, as claim, peace for
themselves; nay, should say that they already have it in heaven. If they have it, why do they
ask for what they possess? But if, by the very fact that they are asking for it, it is proved that
they have it not, wherefore do they not accept the judgment of those from whom they have
thought fit to ask for the peace, which they certainly have not got? But if they think that
they have from any other source the prerogative of communion, let them try to compare it
with the Gospel, that so at length it may abundantly avail them, if it is not out of harmony
with the Gospel law. But on what principle can that give Gospel communion which seems
to be established contrary to Gospel truth? For since every prerogative contemplates the
privilege of association, precisely on the assumption of its not being out of harmony with
the will of Him with whom it seeks to be associated; then, because this is alien from His will
with whom it seeks to be associated, it must of necessity lose the indulgence and privilege
of the association.</p>

<note type="footnote">2326 “Papa” = pope. [It may thus be noted what this word meant at Rome: nothing more than the fatherly
address of all bishops.]</note>

<pb n="762"/>
<p>2. Let them, then, see what it is they are trying to do in this matter. For if they say that
the Gospel has established one decree, but the martyrs have established another; then they,
setting the martyrs at variance with the Gospel, will be in danger on both sides. For, on the
one hand, the majesty of the Gospel will already appear shattered and cast down, if it can
be overcome by the novelty of another decree; and, on the other, the glorious crown of
confession will be taken from the heads of the martyrs, if they be not found to have attained
it by the observation of that Gospel whence they become martyrs; so that, reasonably, no
one should be more careful to determine nothing contrary to the Gospel, than he who strives
to receive the name of martyr from the Gospel. We should like, besides, to be informed of
this: if martyrs become martyrs for no other reason than that by not sacrificing they may
keep the peace of the Church even to the shedding of their own blood, lest, overcome by
the suffering of the torture, by losing peace, they might lose salvation; on what principle do
they think that the salvation, which if they had sacrificed they thought that they should not
have, was to be given to those who are said to have sacrificed; although they ought to
maintain that law in others, which they themselves appear to have held before their own
eyes? In which thing we observe that they have put forward against their own cause the very
thing which they thought made for them. For if the martyrs thought that peace was to be
granted to them, why did not they themselves grant it? Why did they think that, as they
themselves say, they were to be referred to the bishops? For he who orders a thing to be
done, can assuredly do that which he orders to be done. But, as we understand, nay, as the
case itself speaks and proclaims, the most holy martyrs thought that a proper measure of
modesty and of truth must be observed on both sides. For as they were urged by many, in
remitting them to the bishop they conceived that they would consult their own modesty so
as to be no further disquieted; and in themselves not holding communion with them, they
judged that the purity of the Gospel law ought to be maintained unimpaired.</p>
<p>3. But of your charity, brother, never desist from soothing the spirits of the lapsed and
affording to the erring the medicine of truth, although the temper of the sick is wont to reject
the kind offices of those who would heal them. This wound of the lapsed is as yet fresh, and
the sore is still rising into a tumour; and therefore we are certain, that when, in the course
of more protracted time, that urgency of theirs shall have worn out, they will love that very
delay which refers them to a faithful medicine; if only there be not those who arm them for
their own danger, and, instructing them perversely, demand on their behalf, instead of the
salutary remedies of delay, the fatal poisons of a premature communion. For we do not believe,
that without the instigation of certain persons they would all have dared so petulantly
to claim peace for themselves. We know the faith of the Carthaginian church,2327 we know
<note type="footnote">2327 [The church at Rome recognises national churches as sisters. The“ Roman Catholic” theory was not
known, even under the Papacy, till the Trent Council, which destroyed “sister churches.”]</note>

<pb n="763"/>
her training, we know her humility; whence also we have marvelled that we should observe
certain things somewhat rudely suggested against you by letter, although we have often become
aware of your mutual love and charity, in many illustrations of reciprocal affection
of one another. It is time, therefore, that they should repent of their fault, that they should
prove their grief for their lapse, that they should show modesty, that they should manifest
humility, that they should exhibit some shame, that, by their submission, they should appeal
to God’s clemency for themselves, and by due honour for2328 God’s priest should draw forth
upon themselves the divine mercy. How vastly better would have been the letters of these
men themselves, if the prayers of those who stood fast had been aided by their own humility!
since that which is asked for is more easily obtained, when he for whom it is asked is worthy,
that what is asked should be obtained.</p>
<p>4. In respect, however, of Privatus of Lambesa, you have acted as you usually do, in desiring
to inform us of the matter, as being an object of anxiety; for it becomes us all to watch
for the body of the whole Church, whose members are scattered through every various
province.2329 But the deceitfulness of that crafty man could not be hid from us even before
we had your letters; for previously, when from the company of that very wickedness a certain
Futurus came, a standard-bearer of Privatus, and was desirous of fraudulently obtaining
letters from us, we were neither ignorant who he was, nor did he get the letters which he
wanted. We bid you heartily farewell in the Lord.</p>

<p>The Roman Clergy to Cyprian.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Roman Clergy Enter into the Matters Which They Had Spoken of
in the Foregoing Letter, More Fully and Substantially in the Present One;
Replying, Moreover, to Another Letter of Cyprian, Which is Thought Not to Be
Extant, and from Which They Quote a Few Words. They Thank Cyprian for
His Letters Sent to the Roman Confessors and Martyrs.2331</p>
<p>1. To Father2332 Cyprian, the presbyters and deacons abiding at Rome, greeting. Although
a mind conscious to itself of uprightness, and relying on the vigour of evangelical
discipline, and made a true witness to itself in the heavenly decrees, is accustomed to be
satisfied with God for its only judge, and neither to seek the praises nor to dread the charges
of any other, yet those are worthy of double praise, who, knowing that they owe their conscience
to God alone as the judge, yet desire that their doings should be approved also by
their brethren themselves. It is no wonder, brother Cyprian, that you should do this, who,
with your usual modesty and inborn industry, have wished that we should be found not so
much judges of, as sharers in, your counsels, so that we might find praise with you in your
doings while we approve them; and might be able to be fellow-heirs with you in your good
counsels, because we entirely accord with them. In the same way we are all thought to have
laboured in that in which we are all regarded as allied in the same agreement of censure and
discipline.</p>
<p>2. For what is there either in peace so suitable, or in a war of persecution so necessary,
as to maintain the due severity of the divine rigour? Which he who resists, will of necessity
wander in the unsteady course of affairs, and will be tossed hither and thither by the various
and uncertain storms of things; and the helm of counsel being, as it were, wrenched from
his hands he will drive the ship of the Church’s safety among the rocks; so that it would
appear that the Church’s safety can be no otherwise secured, than by repelling any who set
themselves against it as adverse waves, and by maintaining the ever-guarded rule of discipline
itself as if it were the rudder of safety in the tempest. Nor is it now but lately that this
counsel has been considered by us, nor have these sudden appliances against the wicked
but recently occurred to us; but this is read of among us as the ancient severity, the ancient

<pb n="765"/>
faith, the ancient discipline,2333 since the apostle would not have published such praise
concerning us, when he said “that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world”2334
unless already from thence that vigour had borrowed the roots of faith from those times;
from which praise and glory it is a very great crime to have become degenerate.2335 For it
is less disgrace never to have attained to the heraldry of praise, than to have fallen from the
height of praise; it is a smaller crime not to have been honoured with a good testimony, than
to have lost the honour of good testimonies; it is less discredit to have lain without the announcement
of virtues, ignoble without praise, than, disinherited of the faith,2336 to have
lost our proper praises. For those things which are proclaimed to the glory of any one, unless
they are maintained by anxious and careful pains, swell up into the odium of the greatest
crime.2337</p>
<p>3. That we are not saying this dishonestly, our former letters have proved, wherein we
have declared our opinion to you with a very plain statement, both against those who had
betrayed themselves as unfaithful by the unlawful presentation of wicked certificates, as if
they thought that they would escape those ensnaring nets of the devil; whereas, not less than
if they had approached to the wicked altars,2338 they were held fast by the very fact that they
had testified to him; and against those who had used those certificates when made, although
they had not been present when they were made, since they had certainly asserted their
presence by ordering that they should be so written. For he is not guiltless of wickedness
who has bidden it to be done; nor is he unconcerned in the crime with whose consent it is
publicly spoken of, although it was not committed by him. And since the whole mystery2339
of faith is understood to be contained in the confession of the name of Christ, he who seeks
for deceitful tricks to excuse himself, has denied Christ; and he who wants to appear to have
satisfied either edicts or laws put forth against the Gospel, has obeyed those edicts by the
very fact by which he wished to appear to have obeyed them. Moreover, also, we have declared
our faith and consent against those, too, who had polluted their hands and their mouths
with unlawful sacrifices, whose own minds were before polluted; whence also their very
hands and mouths were polluted also.2340 Far be it from the Roman Church to slacken her
vigour with so profane a facility, and to loosen the nerves of her severity by overthrowing

the majesty of faith; so that, when the wrecks of your ruined brethren are still not only lying,
but are falling around, remedies of a too hasty kind, and certainly not likely to avail, should
be afforded for communion; and by a false mercy, new wounds should be impressed on the
old wounds of their transgression; so that even repentance should be snatched from these
wretched beings, to their greater overthrow. For where can the medicine of indulgence
profit, if even the physician himself, by intercepting repentance, makes easy way for new
dangers, if he only hides the wound, and does not suffer the necessary remedy of time to
close the scar? This is not to cure, but, if we wish to speak the truth, to slay.2341</p>
<p>4. Nevertheless, you have letters agreeing with our letters from the confessors, whom
the dignity of their confession has still shut up here in prison, and whom, for the Gospel
contest, their faith has once already crowned in a glorious confession; letters wherein they
have maintained the severity of the Gospel discipline, and have revoked the unlawful petitions,
so that they might not be a disgrace to the Church. Unless they had done this, the
ruins of Gospel discipline2342 would not easily be restored, especially since it was to none
so fitting to maintain the tenor of evangelical vigour unimpaired, and its dignity, as to those
who had given themselves up to be tortured and cut to pieces by raging men on behalf of
the Gospel, that they might not deservedly forfeit the honour of martyrdom, if, on the occasion
of martyrdom, they had wished to be betrayers of the Gospel. For he who does not
guard what he has, in that condition whereon he possesses it, by violating the condition
whereon he possesses it, loses what he possessed.</p>
<p>5. In which matter we ought to give you also, and we do give you, abundant thanks, that
you have brightened the darkness of their prison by your letters; that you came to them in
whatever way you could enter; that you refreshed their minds, robust in their own faith and
confession, by your addresses and letters; that, following up their felicities with worthy
praises, you have inflamed them to a much more ardent desire of heavenly glory; that you
urged them forward; that you animated, by the power of your discourse, those who, as we
believe and hope, will be victors by and by; so that although all may seem to come from the
faith of those who confess, and from the divine mercy, yet they seem in their martyrdom
to have become in some sort debtors to you. But once more, to return to the point whence
our discourse appears to have digressed, you shall find subjoined the sort of letters that we
also sent to Sicily; although upon us is incumbent a greater necessity of delaying this affair;
having, since the departure of Fabian of most noble memory, had no bishop appointed as
yet, on account of the difficulties of affairs and times, who can arrange all things of this kind,
and who can take account of those who are lapsed, with authority and wisdom. However,

what you also have yourself declared in so important a matter, is satisfactory to us, that the
peace of the Church must first be maintained; then, that an assembly for counsel being

laity who stand fast,2343 we should deal with the case of the lapsed. For it seems extremely
invidious and burdensome to examine into what seems to have been committed by many,
except by the advice of many; or that one should give a sentence when so great a crime is
known to have gone forth, and to be diffused among so many; since that cannot be a firm
decree which shall not appear to have had the consent of very many.2344 Look upon almost
the whole world devastated, and observe that the remains and the ruins of the fallen are lying
about on every side, and consider that therefore an extent of counsel is asked for, large in
proportion as the crime appears to be widely propagated. Let not the medicine be less than
the wound, let not the remedies be fewer than the deaths, that in the same manner as those
who fell, fell for this reason that they were too incautious with a blind rashness, so those
who strive to set in order this mischief should use every moderation in counsels, lest anything
done as it ought not to be, should, as it were, be judged by all of no effect.</p>
<p>6. Thus, with one and the same counsel, with the same prayers and tears, let us, who up
to the present time seem to have escaped the destruction of these times of ours, as well as
those who appear to have fallen into those calamities of the time, entreat the divine majesty,
and ask peace for the Church’s name. With mutual prayers, let us by turns cherish, guard,
arm one another; let us pray for the lapsed,2345 that they may be raised up; let us pray for
those who stand, that they may not be tempted to such a degree as to be destroyed; let us
pray that those who are said to have fallen may acknowledge the greatness of their sin, and
may perceive that it needs no momentary nor over-hasty cure; let us pray that penitence
may follow also the effects of the pardon of the lapsed; that so, when they have understood
their own crime, they may be willing to have patience with us for a while, and no longer
disturb the fluctuating condition of the Church, lest they may seem themselves to have inflamed
an internal persecution for us, and the fact of their unquietness be added to the heap
of their sins. For modesty is very greatly fitting for them in whose sins it is an immodest
mind that is condemned. Let them indeed knock at the doors, but assuredly let them not
break them down; let them present themselves at the threshold of the church, but certainly
let them not leap over it; let them watch at the gates of the heavenly camp, but let them be
armed with modesty, by which they perceive that they have been deserters; let them resume
the trumpet of their prayers, but let them not therewith sound a point of war; let them arm

themselves indeed with the weapons of modesty, and let them resume the shield of faith,
which they had put off by their denial through the fear of death, but let those that are even
now armed believe that they are armed against their foe, the devil, not against the Church,
which grieves over their fall. A modest petition will much avail them; a bashful entreaty, a
necessary humility, a patience which is not careless. Let them send tears as their ambassadors
for their sufferings; let groanings, brought forth from their deepest heart, discharge the office
of advocate, and prove their grief and shame for the crime they have committed.</p>
<p>7. Nay, if they shudder at the magnitude of the guilt incurred; if with a truly medicinal
hand they deal with the deadly wound of their heart and conscience and the deep recesses
of the subtle mischief, let them blush even to ask; except, again, that it is a matter of greater
risk and shame not to have besought the aid of peace. But let all this be in the sacrament;2346
in the law of their very entreaty let consideration be had for the time; let it be with downcast
entreaty, with subdued petition, since he also who is besought ought to be bent, not provoked;
and as the divine clemency ought to be looked to, so also ought the divine censure; and as
it is written, “I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me,”2347 so it is written,
“Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father and before
His angels.”2348 For God, as He is merciful, so He exacts obedience to His precepts, and
indeed carefully exacts it; and as He invites to the banquet, so the man that hath not a wedding
garment He binds hands and feet, and casts him out beyond the assembly of the saints.
He has prepared heaven, but He has also prepared hell.2349 He has prepared places of refreshment,
but He has also prepared eternal punishment. He has prepared the light that
none can approach unto, but He has also prepared the vast and eternal gloom of perpetual
night.</p>
<p>8. Desiring to maintain the moderation of this middle course in these matters, we for a
long time, and indeed many of us, and, moreover, with some of the bishops who are near
to us and within reach, and some whom, placed afar off, the heat of the persecution had
driven out from other provinces,2350 have thought that nothing new was to be done before
the appointment of a bishop; but we believe that the care of the lapsed must be moderately
dealt with, so that, in the meantime, whilst the grant of a bishop is withheld from us2351 by

with weeping they have betrayed the signs of a grieving and truly penitent spirit, when there
remains, as far as man can tell, no hope of living; to them, finally, such cautious and careful
help should be ministered, God Himself knowing what He will do with such, and in what
way He will examine the balance of His judgment; while we, however, take anxious care
that neither ungodly men should praise our smooth facility, nor truly penitent men accuse

<p>To the Clergy and People, About the Ordination of Aurelius as a Reader.
Argument.—Cyprian Tells the Clergy and People that Aurelius the Confessor Has
Been Ordained a Reader by Him, and Commends, by the Way, the Constancy
of His Virtue and His Mind, Whereby He Was Even Deserving of a Higher Degree
in the Church.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the elders and deacons, and to the whole people, greeting. In ordinations
of the clergy, beloved brethren, we usually consult you beforehand, and weigh the character
and deserts of individuals, with the general advice.2357 But human testimonies must not be
waited for when the divine approval precedes. Aurelius, our brother, an illustrious youth,
already approved by the Lord, and dear to God, in years still very young, but, in the praise
of virtue and of faith, advanced; inferior in the natural abilities of his age, but superior in
the honour he has merited,—has contended here in a double conflict, having twice confessed
and twice been glorious in the victory of his confession, both when he conquered in the
course and was banished, and when at length he fought in a severer conflict, he was triumphant
and victorious in the battle of suffering. As often as the adversary wished to call
forth the servants of God, so often this prompt and brave soldier both fought and conquered.
It had been a slight matter, previously to have engaged under the eyes of a few when he was
banished; he deserved also in the forum to engage with a more illustrious virtue so that,
after overcoming the magistrates, he might also triumph over the proconsul, and, after exile,
might vanquish tortures also. Nor can I discover what I ought to speak most of in him,—the
glory of his wounds or the modesty of his character; that he is distinguished by the honour
of his virtue, or praiseworthy for the admirableness of his modesty. He is both so excellent
in dignity and so lowly in humility, that it seems that he is divinely reserved as one who
should be an example to the rest for ecclesiastical discipline, of the way in which the servants
of God should in confession conquer by their courage, and, after confession, be conspicuous
for their character.</p>
<p>2. Such a one, to be estimated not by his years but by his deserts, merited higher degrees
of clerical ordination and larger increase. But, in the meantime, I judged it well, that he
should begin with the office of reading; because nothing is more suitable for the voice which
has confessed the Lord in a glorious utterance, than to sound Him forth in the solemn repetition
of the divine lessons; than, after the sublime words which spoke out the witness of

Christ, to read the Gospel of Christ whence martyrs are made; to come to the desk after the
scaffold; there to have been conspicuous to the multitude of the Gentiles, here to be beheld
by the brethren; there to have been heard with the wonder of the surrounding people, here
to be heard with the joy of the brotherhood. Know, then, most beloved brethren, that this
man has been ordained by me and by my colleagues who were then present. I know that
you will both gladly welcome these tidings, and that you desire that as many such as possible
may be ordained in our church. And since joy is always hasty, and gladness can bear no
delay, he reads on the Lord’s day, in the meantime, for me; that is, he has made a beginning
of peace, by solemnly entering on his office of a reader.2358 Do you frequently be urgent in
supplications, and assist my prayers by yours, that the Lord’s mercy favouring us may soon
restore both the priest2359 safe to his people, and the martyr for a reader with the priest. I
bid you, beloved brethren in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle XXXIII.2360</head>
<p>To the Clergy and People, About the Ordination of Celerinus as Reader.</p>
<p>Argument.—This Letter is About the Same in Purport with the Preceding, Except
that He Largely Commends the Constancy of Celerinus in His Confession of the
Faith. Moreover, that Both of These Letters Were Written During His Retreat,
is Sufficiently Indicated by the Circumstances of the Context.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, and to the whole people, his brethren in the
Lord, greeting. The divine benefits, beloved brethren, should be acknowledged and embraced,
wherewith the Lord has condescended to embellish and illustrate His Church in our times
by granting a respite to His good confessors and His glorious martyrs, that they who had
grandly confessed Christ should afterwards adorn Christ’s clergy in ecclesiastical ministries.
Exult, therefore, and rejoice with me on receiving my letter, wherein I and my colleagues
who were then present mention to you Celerinus, our brother, glorious alike for his courage
and his character, as added to our clergy, not by human recommendation, but by divine
condescension; who, when he hesitated to yield to the Church, was constrained by her own
admonition and exhortation, in a vision by night, not to refuse our persuasions; and she
had more power, and constrained him, because it was not right, nor was it becoming, that
he should be without ecclesiastical honour, whom the Lord honoured with the dignity of
heavenly glory.2361</p>
<p>2. This man was the first in the struggle of our days; he was the leader among Christ’s
soldiers; he, in the midst of the burning beginnings of the persecution, engaged with the
very chief and author of the disturbance, in conquering with invincible firmness the adversary
of his own conflict.2362 He made a way for others to conquer; a victor with no small amount
of wounds, but triumphant by a miracle, with the long-abiding and permanent penalties of
a tedious conflict. For nineteen days, shut up in the close guard of a dungeon, he was racked
and in irons; but although his body was laid in chains, his spirit remained free and at liberty.
His flesh wasted away by the long endurance of hunger and thirst; but God fed his soul, that
lived in faith and virtue, with spiritual nourishments. He lay in punishments, the stronger
for his punishments; imprisoned, greater than those that imprisoned him; lying prostrate,
but loftier than those who stood; as bound, and firmer than the links which bound him;
judged, and more sublime than those who judged him; and although his feet were bound
on the rack, yet the serpent was trodden on and ground down and vanquished. In his glorious
<note type="footnote">2360 Oxford ed.: Ep. xxxix. a.d. 250.</note>
<note type="footnote">2361 [See testimony of Cornelius, in Euseb., H. E., vi. 43.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2362 [He produced some momentary impression on Decius himself.]</note>

<pb n="774"/>
body shine the bright evidences of his wounds; their manifest traces show forth, and appear
on the man’s sinews and limbs, worn out with tedious wasting away.2363 Great things are
they—marvellous things are they—which the brotherhood may hear of his virtues and of
his praises. And should any one appear like Thomas, who has little faith in what he hears,
the faith of the eyes is not wanting, so that what one hears he may also see. In the servant
of God, the glory of the wounds made the victory; the memory of the scars preserves that
glory.</p>
<p>3. Nor is that kind of title to glories in the case of Celerinus, our beloved, an unfamiliar
and novel thing. He is advancing in the footsteps of his kindred; he rivals his parents and
relations in equal honours of divine condescension. His grandmother, Celerina, was some
time since crowned with martyrdom. Moreover, his paternal and maternal uncles, Laurentius
and Egnatius, who themselves also were once warring in the camps of the world, but
were true and spiritual soldiers of God, casting down the devil by the confession of Christ,
merited palms and crowns from the Lord by their illustrious passion. We always offer sacrifices
for them,2364 as you remember, as often as we celebrate the passions and days of the
martyrs in the annual commemoration. Nor could he, therefore, be degenerate and inferior
whom this family dignity and a generous nobility provoked, by domestic examples of virtue
and faith. But if in a worldly family it is a matter of heraldry and of praise to be a patrician,
of how much greater praise and honour is it to become of noble rank in the celestial heraldry!
I cannot tell whom I should call more blessed,—whether those ancestors, for a posterity so
illustrious, or him, for an origin so glorious. So equally between them does the divine condescension
flow, and pass to and fro, that, just as the dignity of their offspring brightens
their crown, so the sublimity of his ancestry illuminates his glory.</p>
<p>4. When this man, beloved brethren, came to us with such condescension of the Lord,
illustrious by the testimony and wonder of the very man who had persecuted him, what else
behoved to be done except that he should be placed on the pulpit,2365 that is, on the tribunal
of the Church; that, resting on the loftiness of a higher station, and conspicuous to the whole
people for the brightness of his honour, he should read the precepts and Gospel of the Lord,
which he so bravely and faithfully follows? Let the voice that has confessed the Lord daily
be heard in those things which the Lord spoke. Let it be seen whether there is any further
degree to which he can be advanced in the Church. There is nothing in which a confessor
can do more good to the brethren than that, while the reading of the Gospel is heard from
his lips, every one who hears should imitate the faith of the reader. He should have been

<pb n="775"/>
associated with Aurelius in reading; with whom, moreover, he was associated in the alliance
of divine honour; with whom, in all the insignia of virtue and praise, he had been united.
Equal both, and each like to the other, in proportion as they were sublime in glory, in that
proportion they were humble in modesty. As they were lifted up by divine condescension,
so they were lowly in their own peacefulness and tranquillity, and equally affording examples
to every one of virtues and character, and fitted both for conflict and for peace; praiseworthy
in the former for strength, in the latter for modesty.</p>
<p>5. In such servants the Lord rejoices; in confessors of this kind He glories,—whose way
and conversation is so advantageous to the announcement of their glory, that it affords to
others a teaching of discipline. For this purpose Christ has willed them to remain long here
in the Church; for this purpose He has kept them safe, snatched from the midst of death,—a
kind of resurrection, so to speak, being wrought on their behalf; so that, while nothing is
seen by the brethren loftier in honour, nothing more lowly in humility, the way of life of
the brotherhood2366 may accompany these same persons. Know, then, that these for the
present are appointed readers, because it was fitting that the candle should be placed in a
candlestick, whence it may give light to all, and that their glorious countenance should be
established in a higher place, where, beheld by all the surrounding brotherhood, they may
give an incitement of glory to the beholders. But know that I have already purposed the
honour of the presbytery for them, that so they may be honoured with the same presents
as the presbyters, and may share the monthly divisions2367 in equalled quantities, to sit with
us hereafter in their advanced and strengthened years; although in nothing can he seem to
be inferior in the qualities of age who has consummated his age by the dignity of his glory.
I bid you, brethren, beloved and earnestly longed-for, ever heartily farewell.</p>

have been admonished and instructed by divine condescension, that Numidicus the presbyter
should be appointed in the number of Carthaginian presbyters, and should sit with us among
the clergy,—a man illustrious by the brightest light of confession, exalted in the honour
both of virtue and of faith; who by his exhortation sent before himself an abundant number
of martyrs, slain by stones and by the flames, and who beheld with joy his wife abiding by
his side, burned (I should rather say, preserved) together with the rest. He himself, half
consumed, overwhelmed with stones, and left for dead,—when afterwards his daughter,
with the anxious consideration of affection, sought for the corpse of her father,—was found
half dead, was drawn out and revived, and remained unwillingly2369 from among the companions
whom he himself had sent before. But the reason of his remaining behind, as we
see, was this: that the Lord might add him to our clergy, and might adorn with glorious
priests the number of our presbyters that had been desolated by the lapse of some.2370 And
when God permits, he shall be advanced to a larger office in his region, when, by the Lord’s
protection, we have come into your presence once more. In the meantime, let what is revealed
be done, that we receive this gift of God with thanksgiving, hoping from the Lord’s mercy
more ornaments of the same kind, that so the strength of His Church being renewed, He

from my own portion, which I have left with Rogatianus, our fellow-presbyter;2372 which

<p>To the Clergy, Bidding Them Show Every Kindness to the Confessors in Prison.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Exhorts His Clergy that Every Kindness and Care Should Be Exer-

Who Died, in Prison; That the Days of Their Death Should Be Carefully Noted,
for the Purpose of Celebrating Their Memory Annually; And, Finally, that They
Should Not Forget the Poor Also.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, his brethren, greeting. Although I know,
dearest brethren, that you have frequently been admonished in my letters to manifest all
care for those who with a glorious voice have confessed the Lord, and are confined in prison;
yet, again and again, I urge it upon you, that no consideration be wanting to them to whose
glory there is nothing wanting. And I wish that the circumstances of the place and of my
station would permit me to present myself at this time with them; promptly and gladly
would I fulfil all the duties of love towards our most courageous brethren in my appointed
ministry. But I beseech you, let your diligence be the representative of my duty, and do all
those things which behove to be done in respect of those whom the divine condescension
has rendered illustrious in such merits of their faith and virtue. Let there be also a more
zealous watchfulness and care bestowed upon the bodies of all those who, although they
were not tortured in prison, yet depart thence by the glorious exit of death. For neither is
their virtue nor their honour too little for them also to be allied with the blessed martyrs.
As far as they could, they bore whatever they were prepared and equipped to bear. He who
under the eyes of God has offered himself to tortures and to death, has suffered whatever
he was willing to suffer; for it was not he that was wanting to the tortures, but the tortures
that were wanting to him. “Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess
before my Father which is in heaven,”2374 saith the Lord. They have confessed Him. “He
that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved,”2375 saith the Lord. They have endured
and have carried the uncorrupted and unstained merits of their virtues through, even unto
the end. And, again, it is written, “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown
of life.”2376 They have persevered in their faithfulness, and stedfastness, and invincibleness,
even unto death. When to the willingness and the confession of the name in prison and in
chains is added also the conclusion of dying, the glory of the martyr is consummated.</p>

<p>2. Finally, also, take note of their days on which they depart, that we may celebrate their
commemoration among the memorials of the martyrs,2377 although Tertullus, our most
faithful and devoted brother, who, in addition to the other solicitude and care which he

blessed brethren in prison pass by the gate of a glorious death to their immortality; and
there are celebrated here by us oblations and sacrifices for their commemorations, which
things, with the Lord’s protection, we shall soon celebrate with you. Let your care also (as
I have already often written) and your diligence not be wanting to the poor,—to such, I
mean, as stand fast in the faith and bravely fight with us, and have not left the camp of Christ;
to whom, indeed, we should now show a greater love and care, in that they are neither
constrained by poverty nor prostrated by the tempest of persecution, but faithfully serve
with the Lord, and have given an example of faith to the other poor. I bid you, brethren
beloved, and greatly longed-for, ever heartily farewell; and remember me. Greet the brotherhood
in my name. Fare ye well.</p>

<p>To Caldonius, Herculanus, and Others, About the Excommunication of Felicissimus.</p>
<p>Argument.—Felicissimus, Together with His Companions in Sedition, is to Be Restrained
from the Communion of All.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Caldonius and Herculanus, his colleagues, also to Rogatianus and Numidicus,
his fellow-presbyters, greeting. I have been greatly grieved, dearest brethren, at the
receipt of your letter, that although I have always proposed to myself and wished to keep
all our brotherhood safe, and to preserve the flock unharmed, as charity requires, you tell
me now that Felicissimus has been attempting many things with wickedness and craft; so
that, besides his old frauds and plundering, of which I had formerly known a good deal, he
has now, moreover, tried to divide with the bishop a portion of the people; that is, to separate
the sheep from the shepherd, and sons from their parents, and to scatter the members of
Christ. And although I sent you as my substitutes to discharge the necessities of our brethren,
with funds, and if any, moreover, wished to exercise their crafts, to assist their wishes with
such an addition as might be sufficient, and at the same time also to take note of their ages
and conditions and deserts,—that I also, upon whom falls the charge of knowing all of them
thoroughly, might promote any that were worthy and humble and meek to the offices of
the ecclesiastical administration;—he has interfered, and directed that no one should be
relieved, and that those things which I had desired should not be ascertained by careful examination;
he has also threatened our brethren, who had first approached to be relieved,
with a wicked exercise of power, and with a violent dread that those who desired to obey
me should not communicate with him in death.2379</p>
<p>2. And since, after all these things, neither moved by the honour of my station, nor
shaken by your authority and presence, but of his own impulse, disturbing the peace of the
brethren he hath rushed forth with many more, and asserted himself as a leader of a faction
and chief of a sedition with a hasty madness—in which respect, indeed, I congratulate several
of the brethren that they have withdrawn from this boldness, and have rather chosen
to consent with you, so that they may remain with the Church, their mother, and receive
their stipends from the bishop who dispenses them, which, indeed, I know for certain, that
others also will peaceably do, and will quickly withdraw from their rash error,—in the
meantime, since Felicissimus has threatened that they should not communicate with him

in death2380 who had obeyed us, that is, who communicated with us, let him receive the
sentence which he first of all declared, that he may know that he is excommunicated by us;
inasmuch as he adds to his frauds and rapines, which we have known by the clearest truth,
the crime also of adultery, which our brethren, grave men, have declared that they have
discovered, and have asseverated that they will prove; all which things we shall then judicially
examine, when, with the Lord’s permission, we shall assemble in one place with many of
our colleagues. But Augendus also, who, considering neither his bishop nor his Church, has
equally associated himself with him in this conspiracy and faction, if he should further
persevere with him, let him bear the sentence which that factious and impetuous man has
provoked on himself. Moreover, whoever shall ally himself with his conspiracy and faction,
let him know that he shall not communicate in the Church with us, since of his own accord
he has preferred to be separated from the Church. Read this letter of mine to our brethren,
and also transmit it to Carthage to the clergy, the names being added of those who have
joined themselves with Felicissimus. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and
remember me. Fare ye well.</p>

<head>Epistle XXXIX.2385</head>
<p>To the People, Concerning Five Schismatic Presbyters of the Faction of Felicissimus.</p>
<p>Argument.—In Like Manner, as in the Epistle But One Before This, Cyprian Told
the Clergy, So Now He Tells the People, that Felicissimus is to Be Avoided, Together
with Five Presbyters of His Faction, Who Not Only Granted Peace to the
Lapsed Without Any Discrimination, But Stirred Up Sedition and Schism Against
Himself.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the whole people, greeting. Although, dearest brethren, Virtius,2386 a most
faithful and upright presbyter, and also Rogatianus and Numidicus, presbyters, confessors,
and illustrious by the glory of the divine condescension, and also the deacons, good men
and devoted to the ecclesiastical administration in all its duties, with the other ministers,
afford you the full attention of their presence, and do not cease to confirm individuals by
their assiduous exhortations, and, moreover, to govern and reform the minds of the lapsed
by their wholesome counsels, yet, as much as I can, I admonish, and as I can, I visit you with
my letters. By my letters I say, dearest brethren; for the malignity and treachery of certain
of the presbyters has accomplished this, that I should not be allowed to come to you before
Easter-day; since mindful of their conspiracy, and retaining that ancient venom against my
episcopate, that is, against your suffrage and God’s judgment, they renew their old attack
upon me, and once more begin their sacrilegious machinations with their accustomed craft.
And, indeed, of God’s providence, neither by our wish nor desire, nay, although we were
forgiving and silent, they have suffered the punishment which they had deserved; so that,
not cast out by us, they of their own accord have cast themselves out. They themselves, before
their own conscience, have passed sentence on themselves in accordance with your suffrages
and the divine. These conspirators and evil men of their own accord have driven themselves
from the Church.</p>
<p>2. Now it has appeared whence came the faction of Felicissimus; on what root and by
what strength it stood. These men supplied in former times encouragements and exhortations
to certain confessors, not to agree with their bishop, not to maintain the ecclesiastical discipline
with faith and quietness according to the Lord’s precepts, not to keep the glory of
their confession with an uncorrupt and unspotted conversation. And lest it should be too
little to have corrupted the minds of certain confessors, and to have wished to arm a portion
of our broken fraternity against God’s priesthood, they have now turned their attention

<note type="footnote">2386 Some read “Britius” or “Briccius.”</note>

<pb n="784"/>
with their envenomed deceitfulness to the ruin of the lapsed, to turn away from the healing
of their wound the sick and the wounded, and those who, by the misfortune of their fall,
are less fit and less sturdy to take stronger counsel; and invite them, by the falsehood of a
fallacious peace, to a fatal rashness, leaving off prayers and supplications, whereby, with
long and continual satisfaction, the Lord is to be appeased.</p>
<p>3. But I pray you, brethren, watch against the snares of the devil, and, taking care for
your own salvation, be diligently on your guard against this death-bearing fallacy. This is
another persecution and another temptation. Those five presbyters are none other than the
five leaders who were lately associated with the magistrates in an edict, that they might
overthrow our faith, that they might turn away the feeble hearts of the brethren to their
deadly nets by the prevarication of the truth. Now the same scheme, the same overturning,
is again brought about by the five presbyters, linked with Felicissimus, to the destruction
of salvation, that God should not be besought, and that he who has denied Christ should
not appeal for mercy to the same Christ whom he had denied; that after the fault of the
crime, repentance also should be taken away; and that the Lord should not be appeased
through bishops and priests, but that the Lord’s priests being forsaken, a new tradition of
a sacrilegious appointment should arise, contrary to the evangelical discipline. And although
it was once arranged as well by us as by the confessors and the city2387 clergy, and moreover
by all the bishops appointed either in our province or beyond the sea,2388 that no novelty
should be introduced in respect of the case of the lapsed unless we all assembled into one
place, and our counsels being compared, should decide upon a moderate sentence, tempered
alike with discipline and with mercy;—against this our counsel they have rebelled, and all
priestly authority and power is destroyed by factious conspiracies.</p>
<p>4. What sufferings do I now endure, dearest brethren, that I myself am not able to come
to you at the present juncture, that I myself cannot approach you each one, that I myself
cannot exhort you according to the teaching of the Lord and of His Gospel! An exile of,
now, two years2389 was not sufficient, and a mournful separation from you, from your
countenance, and from your sight,—continual grief and lamentation, which, in my loneliness
without you, breaks me to pieces with my constant mourning, nor my tears flowing day and
night, that there is not even an opportunity for the priest, whom you made with so much
love and eagerness, to greet you, nor to be enfolded in your embraces. This greater grief is
added to my worn spirit, that in the midst of so much solicitude and necessity I am not able
myself to hasten to you, since, by the threats and by the snares of perfidious men, we are

anxious that on our coming a greater tumult may not arise there; and so, although the
bishop ought to be careful for peace and tranquillity in all things, he himself should seem
to have afforded material for sedition, and to have embittered persecution anew. Hence,
however, beloved brethren, I not only admonish but counsel you, not rashly to trust to
mischievous words, nor to yield an easy consent to deceitful sayings, nor to take darkness
for light, night for day, hunger for food, thirst for drink, poison for medicine, death for
safety. Let not the age nor the authority deceive you of those who, answering to the ancient
wickedness of the two elders;2390 as they attempted to corrupt and violate the chaste
Susannah,2391 are thus also attempting, with their adulterous doctrines, to corrupt the
chastity of the Church and violate the truth of the Gospel.</p>
<p>5. The Lord cries aloud, saying, “Hearken not unto the words of the false prophets, for
the visions of their own hearts deceive them. They speak, but not out of the mouth of the
Lord. They say to them that despise the word of the Lord, Ye shall have peace.”2392 They
are now offering peace who have not peace themselves. They are promising to bring back
and recall the lapsed into the Church, who themselves have departed from the Church.
There is one God, and Christ is one, and there is one Church, and one chair founded upon
the rock by the word of the Lord.2393 Another altar cannot be constituted nor a new
priesthood be made, except the one altar and the one priesthood. Whosoever gathereth
elsewhere, scattereth. Whatsoever is appointed by human madness, so that the divine disposition
is violated, is adulterous, is impious, is sacrilegious. Depart far from the contagion
of men of this kind, and flee from their words, avoiding them as a cancer and a plague, as
the Lord warns you and says, “They are blind leaders of the blind. But if the blind lead the
blind, they shall both fall into the ditch.”2394 They intercept your prayers, which you pour
forth with us to God day and night, to appease Him with a righteous satisfaction. They intercept
your tears with which you wash away the guilt of the sin you have committed; they
intercept the peace which you truly and faithfully ask from the mercy of the Lord; and they
do not know that it is written, “And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, that hath
spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God, shall be put to death.”2395 Let no one,
beloved brethren, make you to err from the ways of the Lord; let no one snatch you, Chris-

tians, from the Gospel of Christ; let no one take sons of the Church away from the Church;
let them perish alone for themselves who have wished to perish; let them remain outside
the Church alone who have departed from the Church; let them alone be without bishops
who have rebelled against bishops; let them alone undergo the penalties of their conspiracies
who formerly, according to your votes, and now according to God’s judgment, have deserved
to undergo the sentence of their own conspiracy and malignity.</p>
<p>6. The Lord warns us in His Gospel, saying, “Ye reject the commandment of God, that
ye may establish your own tradition.”2396 Let them who reject the commandment of God
and endeavour to keep their own tradition be bravely and firmly rejected by you; let one
downfall be sufficient for the lapsed; let no one by his fraud hurl down those who wish to
rise; let no one cast down more deeply and depress those who are down, on whose behalf
we pray that they may be raised up by God’s hand and arm; let no one turn away from all
hope of safety those who are half alive and entreating that they may receive their former
health; let no one extinguish every light of the way of salvation to those that are wavering
in the darkness of their lapse. The apostle instructs us, saying, “If any man teach otherwise,
and consent not to the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ and His doctrine, he is
lifted up with foolishness: from such withdraw thyself.”2397 And again he says, “Let no man
deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the
children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them.”2398 There is no reason
that you should be deceived with vain words, and begin to be partakers of their depravity.
Depart from such, I entreat you, and acquiesce in our counsels, who daily pour out for you
continual prayers to the Lord, who desire that you should be recalled to the Church by the
clemency of the Lord, who pray for the fullest peace from God, first for the mother, and
then for her children. Join also your petitions and prayers with our prayers and petitions;
mingle your tears with our wailings. Avoid the wolves who separate the sheep from the
shepherd; avoid the envenomed tongue of the devil, who from the beginning of the world,
always deceitful and lying, lies that he may deceive, cajoles that he may injure, promises
good that he may give evil, promises life that he may put to death. Now also his words are
evident, and his poisons are plain. He promises peace, in order that peace may not possibly
be attained; he promises salvation, that he who has sinned may not come to salvation; he
promises a Church, when he so contrives that he who believes him may utterly perish apart
from the Church.</p>

bravely, and to maintain your glorious stability, which you kept in persecution with

a continual firmness; and if any of you by the circumvention of the adversary have fallen,
that in this second temptation you should faithfully take counsel for your hope and your
peace; and in order that the Lord may pardon you, that you should not depart from the
priests of the Lord, since it is written, “And the man that will do presumptuously, and will
not hearken unto the priest or unto the judge that shall be in those days, even that man shall
die.”2399 Of this persecution this is the latest and final temptation, which itself also, by the
Lord’s protection, shall quickly pass away; so that I shall be again presented to you after
Easter-day with my colleagues, who, being present, we shall be able as well to arrange as to
complete the matters which require to be done according to your judgment and to the
general advice of all of us as it has been decided before.2400 But if anybody, refusing to repent
and to make satisfaction to God, shall yield to the party of Felicissimus and his satellites,
and shall join himself to the heretical faction, let him know that he cannot afterwards return
to the Church and communicate with the bishops and the people of Christ. I bid you, dearest
brethren, ever heartily farewell, and that you plead with me in continual prayer that the
mercy of God may be entreated.</p>

Church of Carthage are Rejected by Cyprian.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius, his brother, greeting. There have come to us, beloved brother,
sent by Novatian, Maximus the presbyter, and Augendus the deacon, and a certain Machæus
and Longinus. But, as we discovered, as well from the letters which they brought with them,
as from their discourse and declaration, that Novatian had been made bishop; disturbed by
the wickedness of an unlawful ordination made in opposition to the Catholic Church, we
considered at once that they must be restrained from communion with us; and having, in
the meanwhile, refuted and repelled the things which they pertinaciously and obstinately
endeavoured to assert, I and several of my colleagues, who had come together to me, were
awaiting the arrival of our colleagues Caldonius and Fortunatus, whom we had lately sent
to you as ambassadors, and to our fellow-bishops, who were present at your ordination,2403
in order that, when they came and reported the truth of the matter, the wickedness of the
adverse party might be quelled through them, by greater authority and manifest proof. But
there came, in addition, Pompeius and Stephanus, our colleagues, who themselves also, by
way of instructing us thereon, put forward manifest proofs and testimonies in conformity
with their gravity and faithfulness, so that it was not even necessary that those who had
come, as sent by Novatian, should be heard any further. And when in our solemn assembly2404
they burst in with invidious abuse and turbulent clamour, demanding that the
accusations, which they said that they brought and would prove, should be publicly investigated
by us and by the people, we said that it was not consistent with our gravity to suffer
the honour of our colleague, who had already been chosen and ordained and approved by
the laudable sentence of many, to be called into question any further by the abusive voice
of rivals. And because it would be a long business to collect into a letter the matters in which

or from city to city, through certain districts, they seek for companions in their obstinacy
and error to join to themselves in their schism. To whom we have once given this reply, nor
shall we cease to command them to lay aside their pernicious dissensions and disputes, and
to be aware that it is an impiety to forsake their Mother; and to acknowledge and understand
that when a bishop2406 is once made and approved by the testimony and judgment of his
colleagues and the people, another can by no means be appointed.2407 Thus, if they consult
their own interest peaceably and faithfully, if they confess themselves to be maintainers of

Caldonius And Fortunatus, Which Fully Testified to Its Legitimacy; And Incidentally
Repeats, in Respect of the Contrary Faction of the Novatian Party, that
He Did Not in the Very First Instance Give His Adhesion to That, But Rather
to Cornelius, Even to the Extent of Refusing to Receive Accusations Against
Him.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. As was fitting for God’s servants, and especially
for upright and peaceable priests, dearest brother, we recently sent our colleagues
Caldonius and Fortunatus, that they might, not only by the persuasion of our letters, but
by their presence and the advice of all of you, strive and labour with all their power to bring
the members of the divided body into the unity of the Catholic Church, and associate them
into the bond of Christian charity. But since the obstinate and inflexible pertinacity of the
adverse party has not only rejected the bosom and the embrace of its root and Mother, but
even, with a discord spreading and reviving itself worse and worse, has appointed a bishop
for itself, and, contrary to the sacrament once delivered of the divine appointment and of
Catholic Unity, has made an adulterous and opposed head outside the Church; having received
your letters as well as those of our colleagues, at the coming also of our colleagues
Pompeius and Stephanus, good men and very dear to us, by whom all these things were
undoubtedly alleged and proved to us with general gladness,2409 in conformity with the
requirements alike of the sanctity and the truth of the divine tradition and ecclesiastical institution,
we have directed our letters to you. Moreover, bringing these same things under
the notice of our several colleagues throughout the province, we have bidden also that our
brethren, with letters from them, be directed to you.</p>
<p>2. This has been done, although our mind and intention had been already plainly declared
to the brethren, and to the whole of the people in this place, when, having received letters
lately from both parties, we read your letters, and intimated your ordination to the episcopate,
in the ears of every one. Moreover, remembering the common honour, and having respect
for the sacerdotal gravity and sanctity, we repudiated those things which from the other
party had been heaped together with bitter virulence into a document transmitted to us;

alike considering and weighing, that in so great and so religious an assembly of brethren,
in which God’s priests were sitting together, and His altar was set, they ought neither to be
read nor to be heard. For those things should not easily be put forward, nor carelessly and
rudely published, which may move a scandal by means of a quarrelsome pen in the minds
of the hearers, and confuse brethren, who are placed far apart and dwelling across the sea,
with uncertain opinions. Let those beware, who, obeying either their own rage or lust, and
unmindful of the divine law and holiness, rejoice to throw abroad in the meantime things
which they cannot prove; and although they may not be successful in destroying and ruining
innocence, are satisfied with scattering stains upon it with lying reports and false rumours.
Assuredly, we should exert ourselves, as it is fitting for prelates and priests to do, that such
things, when they are written by any, should be repudiated as far as we are concerned. For
otherwise, what will become of that which we learn and which we declare to be laid down
in Scripture: “Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile?”2410 And elsewhere:
“Thy mouth abounded in malice, and thy tongue embraced deceit. Thou satest and
spakest against thy brother, and slanderedst thine own mother’s son.”2411 Also what the
apostle says: “Let no corrupt communication proceed from thy mouth, but that which is
good to the edifying of faith, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.”2412 Further, we
show what the right course of conduct to pursue is,2413 if, when such things are written by
the calumnious temerity of some, we do not allow them to be read among us: and therefore,
dearest brother, when such letters came to me against you, even though they were the letters
of your co-presbyter sitting with you,2414 as they breathed a tone of religious simplicity,
and did not echo with any barkings of curses and revilings, I ordered them to be read to the
clergy and the people.</p>
<p>3. But in desiring letters from our colleagues,2415 who were present at your ordination
at that place, we did not forget the ancient usage, nor did we seek for any novelty. For it was
sufficient for you to announce yourself by letters2416 to have been made bishop, unless there
had been a dissenting faction on the other side, who by their slanderous and calumnious
fabrications disturbed the minds and perplexed the hearts of our colleagues, as well as of

several of the brethren. To set this matter at rest, we judged it necessary to obtain thence
the strong and decided authority of our colleagues who wrote to us; and they, declaring the
testimony of their letters to be fully deserved by your character, and life, and teaching, have
deprived even your rivals, and those who delight either in novelty or evil, of every scruple
of doubt or of difference; and, according to our advice weighed in wholesome reason, the
minds of the brethren tossing about in this sea have sincerely and decidedly approved your
priesthood. For this, my brother, we especially both labour after, and ought to labour after,
to be careful to maintain as much as we can the unity delivered by the Lord, and through
His apostles to us their successors, and, as far as in us lies, to gather into the Church the
dispersed and wandering sheep which the wilful faction and heretical temptation of some
is separating from their Mother; those only being left outside, who by their obstinacy and
madness have persisted, and have been unwilling to return to us; who themselves will have
to give an account to the Lord of the dissension and separation made by them, and of the
Church that they have forsaken.</p>
<p>4. But, so far as pertains to the cause of certain presbyters here, and of Felicissimus, that
you may know what has been done here, our colleagues have sent you letters subscribed by
their own hand, that you may learn, when you have heard the parties, from their letters what
they have thought and what they have pronounced. But you will do better,2417 brother, if
you will also bid copies of the letters which I had sent lately by our colleagues Caldonius
and Fortunatus to you, to be read for the common satisfaction, which I had written concerning
the same Felicissimus and his presbytery to the clergy there, and also to the people, to
be read to the brethren there; declaring your ordination, and the course of the whole transaction,
that so as well there as here the brotherhood may be informed of all things by us.
Moreover, I have here transmitted also copies of the same by Mettius the sub-deacon, sent
by me, and by Nicephorus the acolyte. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<p>Cyprian to Maximus and Nicostratus, and the other confessors, greeting. As you have
frequently gathered from my letters, beloved, what honour I have ever observed in my mode
of speaking for your confession, and what love for the associated brotherhood; believe, I
entreat you, and acquiesce in these my letters, wherein I both write and with simplicity and
fidelity consult for you, and for your doings, and for your praise. For it weighs me down
and saddens me, and the intolerable grief of a smitten, almost prostrate, spirit seizes me,
when I find that you there, contrary to ecclesiastical order, contrary to evangelical law,
contrary to the unity of the Catholic institution, had consented that another bishop should
be made.2421 That is what is neither right nor allowable to be done; that another church
should be set up; that Christ’s members should be torn asunder; that the one mind and body
of the Lord’s flock should be lacerated by a divided emulation. I entreat that in you, at all
events, that unlawful rending of our brotherhood may not continue; but remembering both
your confession and the divine tradition, you may return to the Mother whence you have
gone forth; whence you came to the glory of confession with the rejoicing of the same
Mother. And think not that you are thus maintaining the Gospel of Christ when you separate
yourselves from the flock of Christ, and from His peace and concord; since it is more fitting
for glorious and good soldiers to sit down within their own camp, and so placed within to
manage and provide for those things which are to be dealt with in common. For as our unanimity
and concord ought by no means to be divided, and because we cannot forsake the
Church and go outside her to come to you, we beg and entreat you with what exhortations
we can, rather to return to the Church your Mother, and to our brotherhood. I bid you,

<p>To Cornelius, Concerning Polycarp the Adrumetine.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Excuses Himself in This Letter for What Had Occurred, in That,
During the Time that He Was at Adrumetum, Letters Had Been Sent Thence by
the Clergy of Polycarp, Not to Cornelius, But to the Roman Clergy, Notwithstanding
that Previously Polycarp Himself Had Written Rather to Cornelius. It Appears
Tolerably Plain from the Context Itself that This Was Written After the Preceding
Ones.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. I have read your letters, dearest brother,
which you sent by Primitivus our co-presbyter, in which I perceived that you were annoyed
that, whereas letters from the Adrumetine colony in the name of Polycarp were directed to
you, yet after Liberalis and I came to that place, letters began to be directed thence to the
presbyters and to the deacons.</p>
<p>2. In respect of which I wish you to know, and certainly to believe, that it was done from
no levity or contempt. But when several of our colleagues who had assembled into one place
had determined that, while our co-bishops Caldonius and Fortunatus were sent as ambassadors
to you, all things should be in the meantime suspended as they were, until the same
colleagues of ours, having reduced matters there to peace, or, having discovered their truth,
should return to us; the presbyters and deacons abiding in the Adrumetine colony; in the
absence of our co-bishop Polycarp, were ignorant of what had been decided in common by
us. But when we came before them, and our purpose was understood, they themselves also
began to observe what the others did, so that the agreement of the churches abiding there
was in no respect broken.</p>
<p>3. Some persons, however, sometimes disturb men’s minds and spirits by their words,
in that they relate things otherwise than is the truth. For we, who furnish every person who
sails hence with a plan that they may sail without any offence, know that we have exhorted
them to acknowledge and hold the root and matrix of the Catholic Church.2423 But since
our province is wide-spread, and has Numidia and Mauritania attached to it; lest a schism
made in the city should confuse the minds of the absent with uncertain opinions, we decided—
having obtained by means of the bishops the truth of the matter, and having got a
greater authority for the proof of your ordination, and so at length every scruple being got
rid of from the breast of every one—that letters should be sent you by all who were placed

anywhere in the province; as in fact is done, that so the whole of our colleagues might decidedly
approve of and maintain both you and your communion, that is as well to the unity
of the Catholic Church as to its charity. That all which has by God’s direction come to pass,
and that our design has under Providence been forwarded, we rejoice.</p>
<p>4. For thus as well the truth as the dignity of your episcopate has been established in the
most open light, and with the most manifest and substantial approval; so that from the
replies of our colleagues, who have thence written to us, and from the account and from the
testimonies of our co-bishops Pompeius, and Stephanus, and Caldonius, and Fortunatus,
both the needful cause and the right order, and moreover the glorious innocence, of your
ordination might be known by all. That we, with the rest of our colleagues, may steadily and
firmly administer this office, and keep it in the concordant unanimity of the Catholic Church,
the divine condescension will accomplish; so that the Lord who condescends to elect and
appoint for Himself priests in His Church, may protect them also when elected and appointed
by His good-will and help, inspiring them to govern, and supplying both vigour for restraining
the contumacy of the wicked, and gentleness for cherishing the penitence of the lapsed.

<head>Epistle XLV.2424</head>
<p>Cornelius to Cyprian, on the Return of the Confessors to Unity.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cornelius Informs Cyprian of the Solemn Return of the Confessors to
the Church, and Describes It.</p>
<p>1. Cornelius to Cyprian his brother, greeting. In proportion to the solicitude and anxiety
that we sustained in respect of those confessors who had been circumvented and almost
deceived and alienated from the Church by the craft and malice of that wily and subtle
man,2425 was the joy with which we were affected, and the thanks which we gave to Almighty
God and to our Lord Christ, when they, acknowledging their error, and perceiving the
poisoned cunning of the malignant man, as if of a serpent, came back, as they with one heart
profess, with singleness of will to the Church from which they had gone forth. And first,
indeed, our brethren of approved faith, loving peace and desiring unity, announced that
the swelling pride of these men was already soothed;2426 yet there was no fitting assurance
to induce us easily to believe that they were thoroughly changed. But afterwards, Urbanus
and Sidonius the confessors came to our presbyters, affirming that Maximus the confessor
and presbyter, equally with themselves, desired to return into the Church; but since many
things had preceded this which they had contrived, of which you also have been made aware
from our co-bishops and from my letters, so that faith could not hastily be reposed in them,
we determined to hear from their own mouth and confession those things which they had
sent by the messengers. And when they came, and were required by the presbyters to give
an account of what they had done, and were charged with having very lately repeatedly sent
letters full of calumnies and reproaches, in their name, through all the churches, and had
disturbed nearly all the churches; they affirmed that they had been deceived, and that they
had not known what was in those letters; that only through being misled they had also
committed schismatical acts, and been the authors of heresy, so that they suffered hands to
be imposed on him as if upon a bishop.2427 And when these and other matters had been
charged upon them, they entreated that they might be done away and altogether discharged
from memory.</p>
<p>2. The whole of this transaction therefore being brought before me, I decided that the
presbytery2428 should be brought together; (for there were present five bishops, who were

also present to-day;) so that by well-grounded counsel it might be determined with the
consent of all what ought to be observed in respect of their persons. And that you may know
the feeling of all, and the advice of each one, I decided also to bring to your knowledge our
various opinions, which you will read subjoined. When these things were done, Maximus,
Urbanus, Sidonius, and several brethren who had joined themselves to them, came to the
presbytery, desiring with earnest prayers that what had been done before might fall into
oblivion, and no mention might be made of it; and promising that henceforth, as though
nothing had been either done or said, all things on both sides being forgiven, they would
now exhibit to God a heart clean and pure, following the evangelical word which says,
“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”2429 What remained was, that the
people should be informed of all this proceeding, that they might see those very men established
in the Church whom they had long seen and mourned as wanderers and scattered.
Their will being known, a great concourse of the brotherhood was assembled. There was
one voice from all, giving thanks to God; all were expressing the joy of their heart by tears,
embracing them as if they had this day been set free from the penalty of the dungeon. And
to quote their very own words,—“We,” they say, “know that Cornelius is bishop of the most
holy Catholic Church elected by Almighty God, and by Christ our Lord. We confess our
error; we have suffered imposture; we were deceived by captious perfidy and loquacity. For
although we seemed, as it were, to have held a kind of communion with a man who was a
schismatic and a heretic, yet our mind was always sincere in the Church. For we are not ignorant
that there is one God; that there is one Christ the Lord whom we have confessed,
and one Holy Spirit; and that in the Catholic Church there ought to be one bishop.”2430
Were we not rightly induced by that confession of theirs,2431 to allow that what they had
confessed before the power of the world they might approve when established in the Church?
Wherefore we bade Maximus the presbyter to take his own place; the rest we received with
great approbation of the people. But we remitted all things to Almighty God, in whose power
all things are reserved.</p>
<p>3. These things therefore, brother, written to you in the same hour, at the same moment,
we have transmitted; and I have sent away at once Nicephorus the acolyte, hastening to
descend to embarkation, that so, no delay being made, you might, as if you had been present
among that clergy and in that assembly of people, give thanks to Almighty God and to Christ
our Lord. But we believe—nay, we confide in it for certain—that the others also who have
been ranged in this error will shortly return into the Church when they see their leaders

from Schism.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Congratulates Him on the Return of the Confessors to the Church,
and Reminds Him How Much that Return Benefits the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. I profess that I both have rendered and
do render the greatest thanks without ceasing, dearest brother, to God the Father Almighty,
and to His Christ the Lord and our God and Saviour, that the Church is thus divinely protected,
and its unity and holiness is not constantly nor altogether corrupted by the obstinacy
of perfidy and heretical wickedness. For we have read your letter, and have exultingly received
the greatest joy from the fulfilment of our common desire; to wit, that Maximus the presbyter,
and Urbanus, the confessors, with Sidonius and Macarius, have re-entered into the Catholic
Church, that is, that they have laid aside their error, and given up their schismatical, nay,
their heretical madness, and have sought again in the soundness of faith the home of unity
and truth; that whence they had gone forth to glory, thither they might gloriously return;
and that they who had confessed Christ should not afterwards desert the camp of Christ,
and that they might not tempt the faith of their charity and unity,2433 who had not been
overcome in strength and courage. Behold the safe and unspotted integrity of their praise;
behold the uncorrupted and substantial dignity of these confessors, that they have departed
from the deserters and fugitives, that they have left the betrayers of the faith, and the impugners
of the Catholic Church. With reason did both the people and the brotherhood receive
them when they returned, as you write, with the greatest joy; since in the glory of confessors
who had maintained their glory, and returned to unity, there is none who does not reckon
himself a partner and a sharer.</p>
<p>2. We can estimate the joy of that day2434 from our own feelings. For if, in this place,
the whole number of the brethren rejoiced at your letter which you sent concerning their
confession, and received this tidings of common rejoicing with the greatest alacrity, what
must have been the joy there when the matter itself, and the general gladness, was carried
on under the eyes of all? For since the Lord in His Gospel says that there is the highest “joy
in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,”2435 how much greater is the joy in earth, no less
than in heaven, over confessors who return with their glory and with praise to the Church

of God, and make a way of returning for others by the faith and approval of their example?
For this error had led away certain of our brethren, so that they thought they were following
the communion of confessors. When this error was removed, light was infused into the
breasts of all, and the Catholic Church has been shown to be one, and to be able neither to
be cut nor divided. Nor can any one now be easily deceived by the talkative words of a raging
schismatic, since it has been proved that good and glorious soldiers of Christ could not long
be detained without the Church by the deceitfulness and perfidy of others. I bid you, dearest
brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

let care be taken that it be made known to all our co-bishops and brethren, that Nicostratus
is accused of many crimes, and that not only has he committed frauds and plunders on his
secular patroness, whose affairs he managed; but, moreover (which is reserved to him for
a perpetual punishment), he has abstracted no small deposits of the Church; that Evaristus
has been the author of a schism; and that Zetus has been appointed bishop in his room, and
his successor to the people over whom he had previously presided. But he contrived greater
and worse things by his malice and insatiable wickedness than those which he was then always

that the Day After the Guilty Faction Had Come to Him He Had Received Cornelius’
Letter. Then He Describes at Length Novatus’ Crimes, and the Schism
that Had Before Been Stirred Up by Him in Africa.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. You have acted, dearest brother, both with
diligence and love, in sending us in haste Nicephorus the acolyte, who both told us the
glorious gladness concerning the return of the confessors, and most fully instructed us
against the new and mischievous devices of Novatian and Novatus for attacking the Church
of Christ. For whereas on the day before, that mischievous faction of heretical wickedness
had arrived here, itself already lost and ready to ruin others who should join it, on the day
after, Nicephorus arrived with your letter. From which we both learnt ourselves, and have
begun to teach and to instruct others, that Evaristus from being a bishop has now not remained
even a layman; but, banished from the see and from the people, and an exile from
the Church of Christ, he roves about far and wide through other provinces, and, himself
having made shipwreck of truth and faith, is preparing for some who are like him, as fearful
shipwrecks. Moreover, that Nicostratus, having lost the diaconate of sacred administrations,
because he had abstracted the Church’s money by a sacrilegious fraud, and disowned the
deposits of the widows and orphans, did not wish so much to come into Africa as to escape
thither from the city, from the consciousness of his rapines and his frightful crimes. And
now a deserter and a fugitive from the Church, as if to have changed the clime were to
change the man, he goes on to boast and announce himself a confessor, although he can no
longer either be or be called a confessor of Christ who has denied Christ’s Church. For when
the Apostle Paul says, “For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery; but I speak
concerning Christ and the Church;”2439—when, I say, the blessed apostle says this, and with
his sacred voice testifies to the unity of Christ with the Church, cleaving to one another with
indivisible links, how can he be with Christ who is not with the spouse of Christ, and in His
Church?2440 Or how does he assume to himself the charge of ruling or governing the Church,
who has spoiled and wronged the Church of Christ?</p>

<p>2. For about Novatus there need have been nothing told by you to us, since Novatus
ought rather to have been shown by us to you, as always greedy of novelty, raging with the
rapacity of an insatiable avarice, inflated with the arrogance and stupidity of swelling pride;
always known with bad repute to the bishops there; always condemned by the voice of all
the priests as a heretic and a perfidious man; always inquisitive, that he may betray: he flatters
for the purpose of deceiving, never faithful that he may love; a torch and fire to blow up the
flames of sedition; a whirlwind and tempest to make shipwrecks of the faith; the foe of quiet,
the adversary of tranquillity, the enemy of peace. Finally, when Novatus withdrew thence
from among you, that is, when the storm and the whirlwind departed, calm arose there in
part, and the glorious and good confessors who by his instigation had departed from the
Church, after he retired from the city, returned to the Church. This is the same Novatus
who first sowed among us the flames of discord and schism; who separated some of the
brethren here from the bishop; who, in the persecution itself, was to our people, as it were,
another persecution, to overthrow the minds of the brethren. He it is who, without my leave
or knowledge, of his own factiousness and ambition appointed his attendant Felicissimus
a deacon, and with his own tempest sailing also to Rome to overthrow the Church, endeavoured
to do similar and equal things there, forcibly separating a part of the people from the
clergy, and dividing the concord of the fraternity that was firmly knit together and mutually
loving one another. Since Rome from her greatness plainly ought to take precedence of
Carthage, he there committed still greater and graver crimes.2441 He who in the one place
had made a deacon contrary to the Church, in the other made a bishop. Nor let any one be
surprised at this in such men. The wicked are always madly carried away by their own furious
passions; and after they have committed crimes, they are agitated by the very consciousness
of a depraved mind. Neither can those remain in God’s Church, who have not maintained
its divine and ecclesiastical discipline, either in the conversation of their life or the peace of
their character. Orphans despoiled by him, widows defrauded, moneys moreover of the
Church withheld, exact from him those penalties which we behold inflicted in his madness.
His father also died of hunger in the street, and afterwards even in death was not buried by
him. The womb of his wife was smitten by a blow of his heel; and in the miscarriage that
soon followed, the offspring was brought forth, the fruit of a father’s murder. And now does
he dare to condemn the hands of those who sacrifice, when he himself is more guilty in his
feet, by which the son, who was about to be born, was slain?</p>
<p>3. He long ago feared this consciousness of crime. On account of this he regarded it as
certain that he would not only be turned out of the presbytery, but restrained from commu-

nion; and by the urgency of the brethren, the day of investigation was coming on, on which
his cause was to be dealt with before us, if the persecution had not prevented. He, welcoming
this, with a sort of desire of escaping and evading condemnation, committed all these crimes,

anticipated the judgment of the priests by a voluntary departure, as if to have anticipated

by him, we labour that they may avoid the mischievous neighbourhood of the crafty impostor,
that they may escape the deadly nets of his solicitations, that they may once more seek the
Church from which he deserved by divine authority to be expelled. Such indeed, with the
Lord’s help, we trust may return by His mercy, for one cannot perish unless it is plain that
he must perish, since the Lord in His Gospel says, “Every planting which my heavenly
Father hath not planted shall be rooted up.”2442 He alone who has not been planted in the
precepts and warnings of God the Father, can depart from the Church: he alone can forsake
the bishops2443 and abide in his madness with schismatics and heretics. But the mercy of
God the Father, and the indulgence of Christ our Lord, and our own patience, will unite the
rest with us. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<p>From Cyprian to the Confessors, Congratulating Them on Their Return from
Schism.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Congratulates the Roman Confessors on Their Return into
the Church, and Replies to Their Letters.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Maximus the presbyter, also to Urbanus, and Sidonius, and Macharius,
his brethren, greeting. When I read your letters, dearest brethren, that you wrote to me
about your return, and about the peace of the Church, and the brotherly restoration, I confess
that I was as greatly overjoyed as I had before been overjoyed when I learnt the glory of your
confession, and thankfully received tidings of the heavenly and spiritual renown of your
warfare. For this, moreover, is another confession of your faith and praise; to confess that
the Church is one, and not to become a sharer in other men’s error, or rather wickedness;
to seek anew the same camp whence you went forth, whence with the most vigorous strength
you leapt forth to wage the battle and to subdue the adversary. For the trophies from the
battle-field ought to be brought back thither whence the arms for the field had been received,
lest the Church of Christ should not retain those same glorious warriors whom Christ had
furnished for glory. Now, however, you have kept in the peace of the Lord the fitting tenor
of your faith and the law of undivided charity and concord, and have given by your walk
an example of love and peace to others; so that the truth of the Church, and the unity of the
Gospel mystery which is held by us, are also linked together by your consent and bond; and
confessors of Christ do not become the leaders of error, after having stood forth as praiseworthy
originators of virtue and honour.</p>
<p>2. Let others consider how much they may congratulate you, or how much each one
may glory for himself: I confess that I congratulate you more, and I more boast of you to
others, in respect of this your peaceful return and charity. For you ought in simplicity to
hear what was in my heart. I grieved vehemently, and I was greatly afflicted, that I could
not hold communion with those whom once I had begun to love. After the schismatical and
heretical error laid hold of you, on your going forth from prison, it seemed as if your glory
had been left in the dungeon. For there the dignity of your name seemed to have stayed
behind when the soldiers of Christ did not return from the prison to the Church, although
they had gone into the prison with the praise and congratulations of the Church.</p>
<p>3. For although there seem to be tares in the Church, yet neither our faith nor our
charity ought to be hindered, so that because we see that there are tares in the Church we
ourselves should withdraw from the Church: we ought only to labour that we may be wheat,
<note type="footnote">2446 Oxford ed.: Ep. liv. a.d. 252.</note>

<pb n="808"/>
that when the wheat shall begin to be gathered into the Lord’s barns, we may receive fruit
for our labour and work. The apostle in his epistle says, “In a great house there are not only
vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour and some to
dishonour.”2447 Let us strive, dearest brethren, and labour as much as we possibly can, that
we may be vessels of gold or silver. But to the Lord alone it is granted to break the vessels
of earth, to whom also is given the rod of iron. The servant cannot be greater than his lord,
nor may any one claim to himself what the Father has given to the Son alone, so as to think
that he can take the fan for winnowing and purging the threshing-floor, or can separate by
human judgment all the tares from the wheat. That is a proud obstinacy and a sacrilegious
presumption which a depraved madness assumes to itself. And while some are always assuming
to themselves more dominion than meek justice demands, they perish from the
Church; and while they insolently extol themselves, blinded by their own swelling, they lose
the light of truth. For which reason we also, keeping moderation, and considering the Lord’s
balances, and thinking of the love and mercy of God the Father, have long and carefully
pondered with ourselves, and have weighed what was to be done with due moderation.</p>
<p>4. All which matters you can look into thoroughly, if you will read the tracts2448 which
I have lately read here, and have, for the sake of our mutual love, transmitted to you also
for you to read; wherein there is neither wanting for the lapsed, censure which may rebuke,
nor medicine which may heal. Moreover, my feeble ability has expressed as well as it could
the unity of the Catholic Church.2449 Which treatise I now more and more trust will be
pleasing to you, since you now read it in such a way as both to approve and love it; inasmuch
as what we have written in words you fulfil in deeds, when you return to the Church in the
unity of charity and peace. I bid you, dearest brethren, and greatly longed-for, ever heartily
farewell.</p>

<p>To Antonianus About Cornelius and Novatian.</p>
<p>Argument.—When Antonianus, Having Received Letters from Novatian, Had Begun
to Be Disposed in His Mind Towards His Party, Cyprian Confirms Him in His
Former Opinion, Namely, that of Continuing to Hold Communion with His
Bishop and So with the Catholic Church. He Excuses Himself for His Own
Change of Opinion in Respect of the Lapsed, and at the End He Explains Wherein
Consists the Novatian Heresy.2451</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Antonianus his brother, greeting. I received your first letters, dearest
brother, firmly maintaining the concord of the priestly college, and adhering to the Catholic
Church, in which you intimated that you did not hold communion with Novatian, but followed
my advice, and held one common agreement with Cornelius our co-bishop.2452 You
wrote, moreover, for me to transmit a copy of those same letters to Cornelius our colleague,
so that he might lay aside all anxiety, and know at once that you held communion with him,
that is, with the Catholic Church.2453</p>
<p>2. But subsequently there arrived other letters of yours sent by Quintus our co-presbyter,
in which I observed that your mind, influenced by the letters of Novatian, had begun to
waver. For although previously you had settled your opinion and consent firmly, you desired
in these letters that I should write to you once more what heresy Novatian had introduced,
or on what grounds Cornelius holds communion with Trophimus and the sacrificers. In
which matters, indeed, if you are anxiously careful, from solicitude for the faith, and are
diligently seeking out the truth of a doubtful matter, the hesitating anxiety of a mind undecided
in the fear of God, is not to be blamed.</p>
<p>3. Yet, as I see that after the first opinion expressed in your letter, you have been disturbed
subsequently by letters of Novatian, I assert this first of all, dearest brother, that grave men,
and men who are once established upon the strong rock with solid firmness, are not moved,
I say not with a light air, but even with a wind or a tempest, lest their mind, changeable and
<note type="footnote">2450 Oxford ed.: Ep. lv. a.d. 252.</note>
<note type="footnote">2451 That he may induce him to this, he narrates the history of the whole disturbance between Cornelius and
Novatian, and explains that Cornelius was an excellent man, and legitimately elected; while Novatian was guilty
of many crimes, and had obtained an unlawful election.</note>

<pb n="810"/>
uncertain, be frequently agitated hither and thither by various opinions, as by gusts of wind
rushing on them, and so be turned from its purpose with some reproach of levity. That the
letters of Novatian may not do this with you, nor with any one, I will set before you, as you
have desired, my brother, an account of the matter in few words. And first of all indeed, as
you also seem troubled about what I too have done, I must clear my own person and cause
in your eyes, lest any should think that I have lightly withdrawn from my purpose, and while
at first and at the commencement I maintained evangelical vigour, yet subsequently I seem
to have turned my mind from discipline and from its former severity of judgment, so as to
think that those who have stained their conscience with certificates, or have offered abominable
sacrifices, are to have peace made easy to them. Both of which things have been done
by me, not without long-balanced and pondered reasons.</p>
<p>4. For when the battle was still going on, and the struggle of a glorious contest was raging
in the persecution, the courage of the soldiers had to be excited with every exhortation, and
with full urgency, and especially the minds of the lapsed had to be roused with the trumpet
call, as it were, of my voice, that they might pursue the way of repentance, not only with
prayers and lamentations; but, since an opportunity was given of repeating the struggle and
of regaining salvation, that they might be reproved by my voice, and stimulated rather to
the ardour of confession and the glory of martyrdom. Finally, when the presbyters and
deacons had written to me about some persons, that they were without moderation and
were eagerly pressing forward to receive communion; replying to them in my letter which
is still in existence,2454 then I added also this: “If these are so excessively eager, they have
what they require in their own power, the time itself providing for them more than they
ask: the battle is still being carried on, and the struggle is daily celebrated: if they truly and
substantially repent of what they have done, and the ardour of their faith prevails, he who
cannot be delayed may be crowned.” But I put off deciding what was to be arranged about
the case of the lapsed, so that when quiet and tranquillity should be granted, and the divine
indulgence should allow the bishops to assemble into one place, then the advice gathered
from the comparison of all opinions being communicated and weighed, we might determine
what was necessary to be done. But if any one, before our council,2455 and before the opinion
decided upon by the advice of all, should rashly wish to communicate with the lapsed, he
himself should be withheld from communion.</p>
<p>5. And this also I wrote very fully to Rome, to the clergy who were then still acting
without a bishop, and to the confessors, Maximus the presbyter, and the rest who were then
shut up in prison, but are now in the Church, joined with Cornelius. You may know that I
wrote this from their reply, for in their letter they wrote thus: “However, what you have
<note type="footnote">2454 Ep. xiii. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">2455 [The provincial council, clearly.]</note>

<pb n="811"/>
yourself also declared in so important a matter is satisfactory to us, that the peace of the
Church must first be maintained; then, that an assembly for counsel being gathered together,
with bishop, presbyters, deacons, and confessors, as well as with the laity who stand fast, we
should deal with the case of the lapsed.”2456 It was added also—Novatian then writing, and
reciting with his own voice what he had written, and the presbyter Moyses, then still a
confessor, but now a martyr, subscribing—that peace ought to be granted to the lapsed who
were sick and at the point of departure. Which letter was sent throughout the whole world,
and was brought to the knowledge of all the churches and all the brethren.2457</p>
<p>6. According, however, to what had been before decided, when the persecution was
quieted, and opportunity of meeting was afforded; a large number of bishops, whom their
faith and the divine protection had preserved in soundness and safety, we met together; and
the divine Scriptures being brought forward2458 on both sides, we balanced the decision
with wholesome moderation, so that neither should hope of communion and peace be
wholly denied to the lapsed, lest they should fail still more through desperation, and, because
the Church was closed to them, should, like the world, live as heathens; nor yet, on the
other hand, should the censure of the Gospel be relaxed, so that they might rashly rush to
communion, but that repentance should be long protracted, and the paternal clemency be
sorrowfully besought, and the cases, and the wishes, and the necessities of individuals be
examined into, according to what is contained in a little book, which I trust has come to
you, in which the several heads of our decisions are collected. And lest perchance the
number of bishops in Africa should seem unsatisfactory, we also wrote to Rome, to Cornelius
our colleague, concerning this thing, who himself also holding a council with very many
bishops, concurred in the same opinion as we had held, with equal gravity and wholesome
moderation.2459</p>
<p>7. Concerning which it has now become necessary to write to you, that you may know
that I have done nothing lightly, but, according to what I had before comprised in my letters,
had put off everything to the common determination of our council, and indeed communicated
with no one of the lapsed as yet, so long as there still was an opening by which the
lapsed might receive not only pardon, but also a crown. Yet afterwards, as the agreement
of our college, and the advantage of gathering the fraternity together and of healing their
wound required, I submitted to the necessity of the times, and thought that the safety of the
many must be provided for; and I do not now recede from these things which have once

<pb n="812"/>
been determined in our council by common agreement, although many things are ventilated
by the voices of many, and lies against God’s priests uttered from the devil’s mouth, and
tossed about everywhere, to the rupture of the concord of Catholic unity. But it behoves
you, as a good brother and a fellow-priest like-minded, not easily to receive what malignants
and apostates may say, but carefully to weigh what your colleagues, modest and grave men,
may do, from an investigation of our life and teaching.</p>
<p>8. I come now, dearest brother, to the character of Cornelius our colleague, that with
us you may more justly know Cornelius, not from the lies of malignants and detractors, but
from the judgment of the Lord God, who made him a bishop, and from the testimony of
his fellow-bishops, the whole number of whom has agreed with an absolute unanimity
throughout the whole world. For,—a thing which with laudable announcement commends
our dearest Cornelius to God and Christ, and to His Church, and also to all his fellowpriests,—
he was not one who on a sudden attained to the episcopate; but, promoted through
all the ecclesiastical offices, and having often deserved well of the Lord in divine administrations,
he ascended by all the grades of religious service to the lofty summit of the Priesthood.
Then, moreover, he did not either ask for the episcopate itself, nor did he wish it; nor, as
others do when the swelling of their arrogance and pride inflates them, did he seize upon
it;2460 but quiet otherwise, and meek and such as those are accustomed to be who are chosen
of God to this office, having regard to the modesty of his virgin continency, and the humility
of his inborn and guarded veneration, he did not, as some do, use force to be made a bishop,
but he himself suffered compulsion, so as to be forced to receive the episcopal office. And
he was made bishop by very many of our colleagues who were then present in the city of
Rome, who sent to us letters concerning his ordination, honourable and laudatory, and remarkable
for their testimony in announcement of him. Moreover, Cornelius was made
bishop by the judgment of God and of His Christ, by the testimony of almost all the clergy,
by the suffrage of the people who were then present, and by the assembly of ancient priests
and good men, when no one had been made so before him, when the place of Fabian, that
is, when the place of Peter2461 and the degree of the sacerdotal throne was vacant; which
being occupied by the will of God, and established by the consent of all of us, whosoever
now wishes to become a bishop, must needs be made from without; and he cannot have the
ordination of the Church who does not hold the unity of the Church. Whoever he may be,
although greatly boasting about himself, and claiming very much for himself, he is profane,
he is an alien, he is without. And as after the first there cannot be a second, whosoever is
made after one who ought to be alone, is not second to him, but is in fact none at all.</p>
<note type="footnote">2460 [Novatian and his like.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2461 [On the death of Fabian, see Ep. iii. p. 281; sufferings of Cornelius (inference), p. 303; Decius, p. 299.]</note>

<pb n="813"/>
<p>9. Then afterwards, when he had undertaken the episcopate, not obtained by solicitation
nor by extortion, but by the will of God who makes priests; what a virtue there was in the
very undertaking of his episcopate, what strength of mind, what firmness of faith,—a thing
that we ought with simple heart both thoroughly to look into and to praise,—that he intrepidly
sate at Rome in the sacerdotal chair at that time when a tyrant, odious to God’s priests,
was threatening things that can, and cannot be spoken, inasmuch as he would much more
patiently and tolerantly hear that a rival prince was raised up against himself than that a
priest of God was established at Rome. Is not this man, dearest brother, to be commended
with the highest testimony of virtue and faith? Is not he to be esteemed among the glorious
confessors and martyrs, who for so long a time sate awaiting the manglers of his body and
the avengers of a ferocious tyrant, who, when Cornelius resisted their deadly edicts, and
trampled on their threats and sufferings and tortures by the vigour of his faith, would either
rush upon him with the sword, or crucify him, or scorch him with fire, or rend his bowels
and his limbs with some unheard-of kind of punishment? Even though the majesty and
goodness of the protecting Lord guarded, when made, the priest whom He willed to be
made; yet Cornelius, in what pertains to his devotion and fear, suffered2462 whatever he
could suffer, and conquered the tyrant first of all by his priestly office, who was afterwards
conquered in arms and in war.</p>
<p>10. But in respect to certain discreditable and malignant things that are bandied about
concerning him, I would not have you wonder when you know that this is always the work
of the devil, to wound God’s servants with lies, and to defame a glorious name by false
opinions, so that they who are bright in the light of their own conscience may be tarnished
by the reports of others. Moreover, you are to know that our colleagues have investigated,
and have certainly discovered that he has been blemished with no stain of a certificate, as
some intimate; neither has he mingled in sacrilegious communion with the bishops who
have sacrificed, but has merely associated with us those whose cause had been heard, and
whose innocence was approved.</p>
<p>11. For with respect to Trophimus also, of whom you wished tidings to be written to
you, the case is not as the report and the falsehood of malignant people had conveyed it to
you. For, as our predecessors often did, our dearest brother, in bringing together the
brethren, yielded to necessity; and since a very large part of the people had withdrawn with
Trophimus, now when Trophimus returned to the Church, and atoned for, and with the
penitence of prayer confessed his former error, and with perfect humility and satisfaction
recalled the brotherhood whom he had lately taken away, his prayers were heard; and not
only Trophimus, but a very great number of brethren who had been with Trophimus, were
admitted into the Church of the Lord, who would not all have returned to the Church unless
<note type="footnote">2462 [On the death of Fabian, see Ep. iii. p. 281; sufferings of Cornelius (inference), p, 303; Decius, p. 299.]</note>

<pb n="814"/>
they had come in Trophimus’ company. Therefore the matter being considered there with
several colleagues,2463 Trophimus was received, for whom the return of the brethren and
salvation restored to many made atonement. Yet Trophimus was admitted in such a manner
as only to communicate as a layman, not, according to the information given to you by the
letters of the malignants, in such a way as to assume the place of a priest.
12. But, moreover, in respect of what has been told you, that Cornelius communicates
everywhere with those who have sacrificed, this intelligence has also arisen from the false
reports of the apostates. For neither can they praise us who depart from us, nor ought we
to expect to please them, who, while they displease us, and revolt against the Church, violently
persist in soliciting brethren away from the Church. Wherefore, dearest brethren, do not
with facility either hear or believe whatever is currently rumoured against Cornelius and
about me.</p>
<p>13. For if any are seized with sicknesses, help is given to them in danger, as it has been
decided. Yet after they have been assisted, and peace has been granted to them in their
danger, they cannot be suffocated by us, or destroyed,2464 or by our force or hands urged
on to the result of death; as if, because peace is granted to the dying, it were necessary that
those who have received peace should die; although the token of divine love and paternal
lenity appears more in this way, that they, who in peace given to them receive the pledge of
life, are moreover here bound to life by the peace they have received. And therefore, if with
peace received, a reprieve is given by God, no one ought to complain of the priests for this,
when once it has been decided that brethren are to be aided in peril. Neither must you
think, dearest brother, as some do, that those who receive certificates are to be put on a par
with those who have sacrificed; since even among those who have sacrificed, the condition
and the case are frequently different. For we must not place on a level one who has at once
leapt forward with good-will to the abominable sacrifice, and one who, after long struggle
and resistance, has reached that fatal result under compulsion; one who has betrayed both
himself and all his connections, and one who, himself approaching the trial in behalf of all,
has protected his wife and his children, and his whole family, by himself undergoing the
danger; one who has compelled his inmates or friends to the crime, and one who has spared
inmates and servants, and has even received many brethren who were departing to banishment
and flight, into his house and hospitality; showing and offering to the Lord many souls
living and safe to entreat for a single wounded one.</p>
<p>14. Since, then, there is much difference2465 between those who have sacrificed, what
a want of mercy it is, and how bitter is the hardship, to associate those who have received
<note type="footnote">2463 [Not by a mere decision, but by consent of “colleagues.”]</note>
<note type="footnote">2464 Opprimi.</note>
<note type="footnote">2465 [Jude 22.]</note>

<pb n="815"/>
certificates, with those who have sacrificed, when he by whom the certificate has been received
may say, “I had previously read, and had been made aware by the discourse of the bishop,2466
that we must not sacrifice to idols, that the servant of God ought not to worship images;
and therefore, in order that I might not do this which was not lawful, when the opportunity
of receiving a certificate was offered, which itself also I should not have received, unless the
opportunity had been put before me, I either went or charged some other person going to
the magistrate, to say that I am a Christian, that I am not allowed to sacrifice, that I cannot
come to the devil’s altars, and that I pay a price for this purpose, that I may not do what is
not lawful for me to do.” Now, however, even he who is stained with having received a certificate,—
after he has learnt from our admonitions that he ought not even to have done this,
and that although his hand is pure, and no contact of deadly food has polluted his lips, yet
his conscience is nevertheless polluted, weeps when he hears us, and laments, and is now
admonished of the thing wherein he has sinned, and having been deceived, not so much by
guilt as by error, bears witness that for another time he is instructed and prepared.</p>
<p>15. If we reject the repentance of those who have some confidence in a conscience that
may be tolerated; at once with their wife, with their children, whom they had kept safe, they
are hurried by the devil’s invitation into heresy or schism; and it will be attributed to us in
the day of judgment, that we have not cared for the wounded sheep,2467 and that on account
of a single wounded one we have lost many sound ones. And whereas the Lord left the ninety
and nine that were whole, and sought after the one wandering and weary, and Himself carried
it, when found, upon His shoulders, we not only do not seek the lapsed, but even drive them
away when they come to us; and while false prophets are not ceasing to lay waste and tear
Christ’s flock, we give an opportunity to dogs and wolves, so that those whom a hateful
persecution has not destroyed, we ruin by our hardness and inhumanity. And what will
become, dearest brother, of what the apostle says: “I please all men in all things, not seeking
mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. Be ye followers of me, as
I also am of Christ.”2468 And again: “To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the
weak.”2469 And again: “Whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one
member rejoice, all the members rejoice with it.”2470</p>
<p>16. The principle of the philosophers and stoics is different, dearest brother, who say
that all sins are equal, and that a grave man ought not easily to be moved. But there is a wide
difference between Christians and philosophers. And when the apostle says, “Beware, lest

which do not come from God’s clemency, but are begotten of the presumption of a too rigid
philosophy. Concerning Moses, moreover, we find it said in the Scriptures, “Now the man
Moses was very meek;”2472 and the Lord in His Gospel says, “Be ye merciful, as your Father
also had mercy upon you;”2473 and again, “They that be whole need not a physician, but
they that are sick.”2474 What medical skill can he exercise who says, “I cure the sound only,
who have no need of a physician?” We ought to give our assistance, our healing art, to those
who are wounded; neither let us think them dead, but rather let us regard them as lying half
alive, whom we see to have been wounded in the fatal persecution, and who, if they had
been altogether dead, would never from the same men become afterwards both confessors
and martyrs.2475</p>
<p>17. But since in them there is that, which, by subsequent repentance, may be strengthened
into faith; and by repentance strength is armed to virtue, which could not be armed if one
should fall away through despair; if, hardly and cruelly separated from the Church, he should
turn himself to Gentile ways and to worldly works, or, if rejected by the Church, he should
pass over to heretics and schismatics; where, although he should afterwards be put to death
on account of the name, still, being placed outside the Church, and divided from unity and
from charity, he could not in his death be crowned. And therefore it was decided, dearest
brother, the case of each individual having been examined into, that the receivers of certificates
should in the meantime be admitted, that those who had sacrificed should be assisted
at death, because there is no confession in the place of the departed,2476 nor can any one
be constrained by us to repentance, if the fruit of repentance be taken away. If the battle
should come first, strengthened by us, he will be found ready armed for the battle; but if
sickness should press hard upon him before the battle, he departs with the consolation of
peace and communion.</p>
<p>18. Moreover, we do not prejudge when the Lord is to be the judge; save that if He shall
find the repentance of the sinners full and sound, He will then ratify what shall have been
here determined by us. If, however, any one should delude us with the pretence of repentance,
God, who is not mocked, and who looks into man’s heart, will judge of those things which
we have imperfectly looked into, and the Lord will amend the sentence of His servants; while
yet, dearest brother, we ought to remember that it is written, “A brother that helpeth a

brother shall be exalted;”2477 and that the apostle also has said, “Let all of you severally have
regard to yourselves, lest ye also be tempted. Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil
the law of Christ;”2478 also that, rebuking the haughty, and breaking down their arrogance,
he says in his epistle, “Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall;”2479 and in
another place he says, “Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? To his own master
he standeth or falleth; yea, he shall stand, for God is able to make him stand.”2480 John also
proves that Jesus Christ the Lord is our Advocate and Intercessor for our sins, saying, “My
little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Supporter: and He is the propitiation for our
sins.”2481 And Paul also, the apostle, in his epistle, has written, “If, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us; much more, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from
wrath through Him.”2482</p>
<p>19. Considering His love and mercy, we ought not to be so bitter, nor cruel, nor inhuman
in cherishing the brethren, but to mourn with those that mourn, and to weep with them
that weep, and to raise them up as much as we can by the help and comfort of our love;
neither being too ungentle and pertinacious in repelling their repentance; nor, again, being
too lax and easy in rashly yielding communion. Lo! a wounded brother lies stricken by the
enemy in the field of battle. There the devil is striving to slay him whom he has wounded;
here Christ is exhorting that he whom He has redeemed may not wholly perish. Whether
of the two do we assist? On whose side do we stand? Whether do we favour the devil, that
he may destroy, and pass by our prostrate lifeless brother, as in the Gospel did the priest
and Levite; or rather, as priests of God and Christ, do we imitate what Christ both taught
and did, and snatch the wounded man from the jaws of the enemy, that we may preserve
him cured for God the judge?2483</p>
<p>20. And do not think, dearest brother, that either the courage of the brethren will be
lessened, or that martyrdoms will fail for this cause, that repentance is relaxed to the lapsed,
and that the hope of peace is offered to the penitent. The strength of the truly believing remains
unshaken; and with those who fear and love God with their whole heart, their integrity
continues steady and strong. For to adulterers even a time of repentance is granted by us,

and peace is given. Yet virginity is not therefore deficient in the Church, nor does the glorious
design of continence languish through the sins of others. The Church, crowned with so
many virgins, flourishes; and chastity and modesty preserve the tenor of their glory. Nor is
the vigour of continence broken down because repentance and pardon are facilitated to the
adulterer. It is one thing to stand for pardon, another thing to attain to glory: it is one thing,
when cast into prison, not to go out thence until one has paid the uttermost farthing; another
thing at once to receive the wages of faith and courage. It is one thing, tortured by long
suffering for sins, to be cleansed and long purged by fire;2484 another to have purged all sins
by suffering. It is one thing, in fine, to be in suspense till the sentence of God at the day of
judgment; another to be at once crowned by the Lord.</p>
<p>21. And, indeed, among our predecessors, some of the bishops here in our province
thought that peace was not to be granted to adulterers, and wholly closed the gate of repentance
against adultery. Still they did not withdraw from the assembly of their co-bishops,
nor break the unity of the Catholic Church2485 by the persistency of their severity or censure;
so that, because by some peace was granted to adulterers, he who did not grant it should be
separated from the Church. While the bond of concord remains, and the undivided sacrament
of the Catholic Church endures, every bishop disposes and directs his own acts, and will
have to give an account of his purposes to the Lord.2486</p>
<p>22. But I wonder that some are so obstinate as to think that repentance is not to be
granted to the lapsed, or to suppose that pardon is to be denied to the penitent, when it is
written, “Remember whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works,”2487 which
certainly is said to him who evidently has fallen, and whom the Lord exhorts to rise up again
by his works, because it is written, “Alms do deliver from death,”2488 and not, assuredly,
from that death which once the blood of Christ extinguished, and from which the saving
grace of baptism and of our Redeemer has delivered us, but from that which subsequently
creeps in through sins. Moreover, in another place time is granted for repentance; and the
Lord threatens him that does not repent: “I have,” saith He, “many things against thee, because
thou sufferest thy wife Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce

my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols; and I gave her a
space to repent, and she will not repent of her fornication. Behold, I will cast her into a bed,
and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their
deeds;”2489 whom certainly the Lord would not exhort to repentance, if it were not that He
promises mercy to them that repent. And in the Gospel He says, “I say unto you, that likewise
joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
persons that need no repentance.”2490 For since it is written, “God did not make death,
neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living,”2491 assuredly He who wills that
none should perish, desires that sinners should repent, and by repentance should return
again to life. Thus also He cries by Joel the prophet, and says, “And now, thus saith the Lord
your God, Turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and
with mourning; and rend your heart, and not your garments, and return unto the Lord your
God; for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth
Him of the evil appointed.”2492 In the Psalms, also, we read as well the rebuke as the clemency
of God, threatening at the same time as He spares, punishing that He may correct; and when
He has corrected, preserving. “I will visit,” He says, “their transgressions with the rod, and
their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from
them.”2493</p>
<p>23. The Lord also in His Gospel, setting forth the love of God the Father, says, “What
man is there of you, whom, if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish,
will he give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give good things to them that ask
Him?”2494 The Lord is here comparing the father after the flesh, and the eternal and liberal
love of God the Father. But if that evil father upon earth, deeply offended by a sinful and
evil son, yet if he should see the same son afterwards reformed, and, the sins of his former
life being put away, restored to sobriety and morality and to the discipline of innocence by
the sorrow of his repentance, both rejoices and gives thanks, and with the eagerness of a
father’s exultation, embraces the restored one, whom before he had cast out; how much
more does that one and true Father, good, merciful, and loving—yea, Himself Goodness
and Mercy and Love—rejoice in the repentance of His own sons! nor threatens punishment
to those who are now repenting, or mourning and lamenting, but rather promises pardon

and clemency. Whence the Lord in the Gospel calls those that mourn, blessed; because he
who mourns calls forth mercy.2495 He who is stubborn and haughty heaps up wrath against
himself, and the punishment of the coming judgment. And therefore, dearest brother, we
have decided that those who do not repent, nor give evidence of sorrow for their sins with
their whole heart, and with manifest profession of their lamentation, are to be absolutely
restrained from the hope of communion and peace if they begin to beg for them in the midst
of sickness and peril; because it is not repentance for sin, but the warning of urgent death,
that drives them to ask; and he is not worthy to receive consolation in death who has not
reflected that he was about to die.</p>
<p>24. In reference, however, to the character of Novatian, dearest brother, of whom you
desired that intelligence should be written you what heresy he had introduced; know that,
in the first place, we ought not even to be inquisitive as to what he teaches, so long as he
teaches out of the pale of unity. Whoever he may be, and whatever he may be, he who is not
in the Church of Christ is not a Christian. Although he may boast himself, and announce
his philosophy or eloquence with lofty words, yet he who has not maintained brotherly love
or ecclesiastical unity has lost even what he previously had been. Unless he seems to you to
be a bishop, who—when a bishop has been made in the Church by sixteen2496 co-bishops—
strives by bribery to be made an adulterous and extraneous bishop by the hands of
deserters; and although there is one Church, divided by Christ throughout the whole world
into many members, and also one episcopate diffused through a harmonious multitude of
many bishops;2497 in spite of God’s tradition, in spite of the combined and everywhere
compacted unity of the Catholic Church, is endeavouring to make a human church, and is
sending his new apostles through very many cities, that he may establish some new foundations
of his own appointment. And although there have already been ordained in each city,
and through all the provinces, bishops old in years, sound in faith, proved in trial, proscribed
in persecution, (this one) dares to create over these other and false bishops: as if he could
either wander over the whole world with the persistence of his new endeavour, or break
asunder the structure of the ecclesiastical body, by the propagation of his own discord, not
knowing that schismatics are always fervid at the beginning, but that they cannot increase
nor add to what they have unlawfully begun, but that they immediately fail together with
their evil emulation. But he could not hold the episcopate, even if he had before been made
bishop, since he has cut himself off from the body of his fellow-bishops, and from the unity
of the Church; since the apostle admonishes that we should mutually sustain one another,
and not withdraw from the unity which God has appointed, and says, “Bearing with one

<pb n="821"/>
another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”2498 He
then who neither maintains the unity of the Spirit nor the bond of peace, and separates
himself from the band of the Church, and from the assembly of priests, can neither have
the power nor the honour of a bishop, since he has refused to maintain either the unity or
the peace of the episcopate.2499</p>
<p>25. Then, moreover, what a swelling of arrogance it is, what oblivion of humility and
gentleness, what a boasting of his own arrogance, that any one should either dare, or think
that he is able, to do what the Lord did not even grant to the apostles; that he should think
that he can discern the tares from the wheat, or, as if it were granted to him to bear the fan
and to purge the threshing-floor, should endeavour to separate the chaff from the wheat;
and since the apostle says, “But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver, but also of wood and of earth,”2500 should think to choose the vessels of gold and of
silver, to despise, to cast away, and to condemn the vessels of wood and of clay; while the
vessels of wood are not burnt up except in the day of the Lord by the flame of the divine
burning, and the vessels of clay are only broken by Him to whom is given the rod of iron.</p>
<p>26. Or if he appoints himself a searcher and judge of the heart and reins, let him in all
cases judge equally. And as he knows that it is written, “Behold, thou art made whole; sin
no more, lest a worse thing happen unto thee,”2501 let him separate the fraudulent and
adulterers from his side and from his company, since the case of an adulterer is by far both
graver and worse than that of one who has taken a certificate, because the latter has sinned
by necessity, the former by free will: the latter, thinking that it is sufficient for him that he
has not sacrificed, has been deceived by an error; the former, a violator of the matrimonial
tie of another, or entering a brothel, into the sink and filthy gulf of the common people, has
befouled by detestable impurity a sanctified body and God’s temple, as says the apostle:
“Every sin that a man doeth is without the body, but he that committeth fornication sinneth
against his own body.”2502 And yet to these persons themselves repentance is granted, and
the hope of lamenting and atoning is left, according to the saying of the same apostle: “I
fear lest, when I come to you, I shall bewail many of those who have sinned already, and
have not repented of the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness which they have
committed.”2503</p>

<p>27. Neither let the new heretics flatter themselves in this, that they say that they do not
communicate with idolaters; although among them there are both adulterers and fraudulent
persons, who are held guilty of the crime of idolatry, according to the saying of the apostle:
“For know this with understanding, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous
man, whose guilt is that of idolatry, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
God.”2504 And again: “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; putting
off fornication, uncleanness, and evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which are the service
of idols: for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God.”2505 For as our bodies are members
of Christ, and we are each a temple of God, whosoever violates the temple of God by adultery,
violates God; and he who, in committing sins, does the will of the devil, serves demons and
idols. For evil deeds do not come from the Holy Spirit, but from the prompting of the adversary,
and lusts born of the unclean spirit constrain men to act against God and to obey
the devil. Thus it happens that if they say that one is polluted by another’s sin, and if they
contend, by their own asseveration, that the idolatry of the delinquent passes over to one
who is not guilty according to their own word; they cannot be excused from the crime of
idolatry, since from the apostolic proof it is evident that the adulterers and defrauders with
whom they communicate are idolaters. But with us, according to our faith and the given
rule of divine preaching, agrees the principle of truth, that every one is himself held fast in
his own sin; nor can one become guilty for another, since the Lord forewarns us, saying,
“The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked
shall be upon him.”2506 And again: “The fathers shall not die for the children, and the children
shall not die for the fathers. Every one shall die in his own sin.”2507 Reading and ob-
serving this, we certainly think that no one is to be restrained from the fruit of satisfaction,
and the hope of peace, since we know, according to the faith of the divine Scriptures, God
Himself being their author, and exhorting in them, both that sinners are brought back to
repentance, and that pardon and mercy are not denied to penitents.2508</p>
<p>28. And oh, mockery of a deceived fraternity! Oh, vain deception of miserable and
senseless mourners! Oh, ineffectual and profitless tradition of heretical institution! to exhort
to the repentance of atonement, and to take away the healing from the atonement; to say
to our brethren, “Mourn and shed tears, and groan day and night, and labour largely and

frequently for the washing away and cleansing of your sin; but, after all these things, you
shall die without the pale of the Church. Whatsoever things are necessary to peace, you
shall do, but none of that peace which you seek shall you receive!” Who would not perish
at once? Who would not fall away, from very desperation? Who would not turn away his
mind from all design of lamentation? Do you think that the husbandman could labour if
you should say, “Till the field with all the skill of husbandry, diligently persevere in its cultivation;
but you shall reap no harvest, you shall press no vintage, you shall receive no fruits
of your olive-yard, you shall gather no apples from the trees;” or if, urging upon any one
the possession and use of ships, you were to say, “Purchase, my brother, material from excellent
woods; inweave your keel with the strongest and chosen oak; labour on the rudder,
the ropes, the sails, that the ship may be constructed and fitted; but when you have done
this, you shall never behold the result from its doings and its voyages?”</p>
<p>29. This is to shut up and to cut off the way of grief and of repentance; so that while in
all Scripture the Lord God sooths those who return to Him and repent, repentance itself is
taken away by our hardness and cruelty, which intercepts the fruits of repentance. But if we
find that none ought to be restrained from repenting, and that peace may be granted by His
priests to those who entreat and beseech the Lord’s mercy, inasmuch as He is merciful and
loving, the groaning of those who mourn is to be admitted, and the fruit of repentance is
not to be denied to those who grieve. And because in the place of the departed there is no
confession, neither can confession be made there,2509 they who have repented from their
whole heart, and have asked for it, ought to be received within the Church, and to be kept
in it for the Lord, who will of a surety judge, when He comes to His Church, those whom
He shall find within it. But apostates and deserters, or adversaries and enemies, and those
who lay waste the Church of Christ, cannot, even if outside the Church they have been slain
for His name, according to the apostle, be admitted to the peace of the Church, since they
have neither kept the unity of the spirit nor of the Church.</p>
<p>30. These few things for the present, out of many, dearest brother, I have run over as
briefly as I could, that I might thereby both satisfy your desire, and might link you more
and more closely to the society of our college and body.2510 But if there should arise to you
an opportunity and power of coming to us, we shall be able to confer more fully together,
and to consider more fruitfully and more at large the things which make for a salutary
agreement. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<p>To Fortunatus and His Other Colleagues, Concerning Those Who Had Been
Overcome by Tortures.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Being Consulted by His Colleagues, Whether Certain Lapsed
Persons Who Had Been Overpowered by Torture Should Be Admitted to Communion,

of Three Years, He Thought They Should Be Received; But as After the Festival
of Easter There Would Be a Council of Bishops with Him, He Would Then
Consider the Matter with Them.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Fortunatus, Ahymnus, Optatus, Privatianus, Donatulus, and Felix, his
brethren, greeting. You have written to me, dearest brethren, that when you were in the city
of Capsa for the purpose of ordaining a bishop, Superius, our brother and colleague brought
before you, that Ninus, Clementianus, and Florus, our brethren, who had been previously
laid hold of in the persecution, and confessing the name of the Lord, had overcome the violence
of the magistracy, and the attack of a raging populace, afterwards, when they were
tortured before the proconsul with severe sufferings, were vanquished by the acuteness of
the torments, and fell, through their lengthened agonies, from the degree of glory to which
in the full virtue of faith they were tending, and after this grave lapse, incurred not willingly
but of necessity, had not yet ceased their repentance for the space of three years: of whom
you thought it right to consult whether it was well to receive them now to communion.</p>
<p>2. And indeed, in respect of my own opinion, I think that the Lord’s mercy will not be
wanting to those who are known to have stood in the ranks of battle, to have confessed the
name,2512 to have overcome the violence of the magistrates and the rush of the raging
populace with the persistency of unshaken faith, to have suffered imprisonment, to have
long resisted, amidst the threats of the proconsul and the warring of the surrounding people,
torments that wrenched and tore them with protracted repetition; so that in the last moment
to have been vanquished by the infirmity of the flesh, may be extenuated by the plea of
preceding deserts. And it may be sufficient for such to have lost their glory, but that we
ought not, moreover, to close the place of pardon to them, and deprive them of their Father’s
love and of our communion; to whom we think it may be sufficient for entreating the mercy
of the Lord, that for three years continually and sorrowfully, as you write, they have
lamented with excessive penitential mourning. Assuredly I do not think that peace is incautiously
and over-hastily granted to those, who by the bravery of their warfare, have not, we

see, been previously wanting to the battle; and who, if the struggle should come on anew,
might be able to regain their glory. For when it was decided in the council that penitents in
peril of sickness should be assisted, and have peace granted to them, surely those ought to
precede in receiving peace whom we see not to have fallen by weakness of mind, but who,
having engaged in the conflict, and being wounded, have not been able to sustain the crown
of their confession through weakness of the flesh; especially since, in their desire to die, they
were not permitted to be slain, but the tortures wrenched their wearied frames long enough,
not to conquer their faith, which is unconquerable, but to exhaust the flesh, which is weak.</p>
<p>3. Since, however, you have written for me to give full consideration to this matter with
many of my colleagues; and so great a subject claims greater and more careful counsel from
the conference of many; and as now almost all, during the first celebrations of Easter, are
dwelling at home with their brethren: when they shall have completed the solemnity to be
celebrated among their own people, and have begun to come to me, I will consider it more
at large with each one, so that a decided opinion, weighed in the council of many priests,
on the subject on which you have consulted me, may be established among us, and may be
written to you. I bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.2513</p>

<p>To Cornelius, Concerning Granting Peace to the Lapsed.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Announces This Decree of the Bishops in the Name of the

<p>1. We had indeed decided some time ago, dearest brother, having mutually taken
counsel one with another, that they who, in the fierceness of persecution, had been overthrown
by the adversary, and had lapsed, and had polluted themselves with unlawful sacrifices,
should undergo a long and full repentance; and if the risk of sickness should be urgent,
should receive peace on the very point of death. For it was not right, neither did the love of
the Father nor divine mercy allow, that the Church should be closed to those that knock,
or the help of the hope of salvation be denied to those who mourn and entreat, so that when
they pass from this world, they should be dismissed to their Lord without communion and
peace; since He Himself who gave the law, that things which were bound on earth should

<note type="footnote">2515 As the African bishops had previously decided in a certain council, that the lapsed, except after long
penitence, should not be received to peace, unless perchance peril of sickness was urgent; now on the appearance
of a new persecution they decided that peace was to be granted to all those who had repented, so that they might
be the more courageous for the contest of suffering.</note>

also be bound in heaven, allowed, moreover, that things might be loosed there which were
here first loosed in the Church. But now, when we see that the day of another trouble is
again beginning to draw near, and are admonished by frequent and repeated intimations
that we should be prepared and armed for the struggle which the enemy announces to us,
that we should also prepare the people committed to us by divine condescension, by our
exhortations, and gather together from all parts all the soldiers of Christ who desire arms,
and are anxious for the battle within the Lord’s camp: under the compulsion of this necessity,
we have decided that peace is to be given to those who have not withdrawn from the Church
of the Lord, but have not ceased from the first day of their lapse to repent, and to lament,
and to beseech the Lord; and we have decided that they ought to be armed and equipped
for the battle which is at hand.</p>
<p>2. For we must comply with fitting intimations and admonitions, that the sheep may
not be deserted in danger by the shepherds, but that the whole flock may be gathered together
into one place, and the Lord’s army may be arrived for the contest of the heavenly warfare.
For the repentance of the mourners was reasonably prolonged for a more protracted time,
help only being afforded to the sick in their departure, so long as peace and tranquillity
prevailed, which permitted the long postponement of the tears of the mourners, and late
assistance in sickness to the dying. But now indeed peace is necessary, not for the sick, but
for the strong; nor is communion to be granted by us to the dying, but to the living, that we
may not leave those whom we stir up and exhort to the battle unarmed and naked, but may
fortify them with the protection of Christ’s body and blood. And, as the Eucharist is appointed
for this very purpose that it may be a safeguard to the receivers, it is needful that we may
arm those whom we wish to be safe against the adversary with the protection of the Lord’s
abundance. For how do we teach or provoke them to shed their blood in confession of His
name, if we deny to those who are about to enter on the warfare the blood of Christ? Or
how do we make them fit for the cup of martyrdom, if we do not first admit them to drink,
in the Church, the cup of the Lord2518 by the right of communion?</p>
<p>3. We should make a difference, dearest brother, between those who either have
apostatized, and, having returned to the world which they have renounced, are living heathenish
lives, or, having become deserters to the heretics, are daily taking up parricidal arms
against the Church; and those who do not depart from the Church’s threshold, and, constantly
and sorrowfully imploring divine and paternal consolation, profess that they are now prepared
for the battle, and ready to stand and fight bravely for the name of their Lord and for
their own salvation. In these times we grant peace, not to those who sleep, but to those who
watch. We grant peace, not amid indulgences, but amid arms. We grant peace, not for rest,
but for the field of battle. If, according to what we hear, and desire, and believe of them,
<note type="footnote">2518 [Compare Luke xxii. 15, 42 and Ps. cxvi. 13.]</note>

<pb n="828"/>
they shall stand bravely, and shall overthrow the adversary with us in the encounter, we
shall not repent of having granted peace to men so brave. Yea, it is the great honour and
glory of our episcopate to have granted peace to martyrs, so that we, as priests, who daily
celebrate the sacrifices of God, may prepare offerings and victims for God. But if—which
may the Lord avert from our brethren—any one of the lapsed should deceive, seeking peace
by guile, and at the time of the impending struggle receiving peace without any purpose of
doing battle, he betrays and deceives himself, hiding one thing in his heart and pronouncing
another with his voice. We, so far as it is allowed to us to see and to judge, look upon the
face of each one; we are not able to scrutinize the heart and to inspect the mind. Concerning
these the Discerner and Searcher of hidden things judges, and He will quickly come and
judge of the secrets and hidden things of the heart. But the evil ought not to stand in the
way of the good, but rather the evil ought to be assisted by the good. Neither is peace,
therefore, to be denied to those who are about to endure martyrdom, because there are some
who will refuse it, since for this purpose peace should be granted to all who are about to
enter upon the warfare, that through our ignorance he may not be the first one to be passed
over, who in the struggle is to be crowned.</p>
<p>4. Nor let any one say, “that he who accepts martyrdom is baptized in his own blood,
and peace is not necessary to him from the bishop, since he is about to have the peace of
his own glory, and about to receive a greater reward from the condescension of the Lord.”
First of all, he cannot be fitted for martyrdom who is not armed for the contest by the Church;
and his spirit is deficient which the Eucharist received does not raise and stimulate. For the
Lord says in His Gospel: “But when they deliver you up, take no thought what ye shall speak;
for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the
Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.”2519 Now, since He says that the Spirit of the
Father speaks in those who are delivered up and set in the confession of His name, how can
he be found prepared or fit for that confession who has not first, in the reception of peace,
received the Spirit of the Father, who, giving strength to His servants, Himself speaks and
confesses in us? Then, besides—if, having forsaken everything that he has, a man shall flee,
and dwelling in hiding-places and in solitude, shall fall by chance among thieves, or shall
die in fever and in weakness, will it not be charged upon us that so good a soldier, who has
forsaken all that he hath, and contemning his house, and his parents, and his children, has
preferred to follow his Lord, dies without peace and without communion? Will not either
inactive negligence or cruel hardness be ascribed to us in the day of judgment, that, pastors
though we are, we have neither been willing to take care of the sheep trusted and committed
to us in peace, nor to arm them in battle? Would not the charge be brought against us by
the Lord, which by His prophet He utters and says? “Behold, ye consume the milk, and ye
<note type="footnote">2519 Matt. x. 19, 20.</note>

<pb n="829"/>
clothe you with the wool, and ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not my flock. The weak
have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye comforted
that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which strayed, neither
have ye sought that which was lost, and that which was strong ye wore out with labour. And
my sheep were scattered, because there were no shepherds: and they became meat to all the
beasts of the field; and there was none who sought after them, nor brought them back.
Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my
sheep of their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding my sheep; neither shall they feed
them any more: and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, and I will feed them with
judgment.”2520</p>
<p>5. Lest, then, the sheep committed to us by the Lord be demanded back from our mouth,
wherewith we deny peace, wherewith we oppose to them rather the severity of human cruelty
than the benignity of divine and paternal love; we have determined2521 by the suggestion of
the Holy Spirit and the admonition of the Lord, conveyed by many and manifest visions,
because the enemy is foretold and shown to be at hand, to gather within the camp the soldiers
of Christ, to examine the cases of each one, and to grant peace to the lapsed, yea, rather to
furnish arms to those who are about to fight. And this, we trust, will please you in contemplation
of the paternal mercy. But if there be any (one) of our colleagues who, now that the
contest is urgent, thinks that peace should not be granted to our brethren and sisters, he
shall give an account to the Lord in the day of judgment, either of his grievous rigour or of
his inhuman hardness. We, as befitted our faith and charity and solicitude, have laid before
you what was in our own mind, namely, that the day of contest has approached, that a violent
enemy will soon rise up against us, that a struggle is coming on, not such as it has been, but
much more serious and fierce. This is frequently shown to us from above; concerning this
we are often admonished by the providence and mercy of the Lord, of whose help and love
we who trust in Him may be secure, because He who in peace foretells to His soldiers that
the battle will come, will give to them when they are warring victory in the encounter. We
bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LIV.2522</head>
<p>To Cornelius, Concerning Fortunatus and Felicissimus, or Against the Heretics.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Chiefly Warns Cornelius in This Letter Not to Hear the
Calumnies of Felicissimus and Fortunatus Against Him, and Not to Be Frightened
by Their Threats, But to Be of a Brave Spirit, as Becomes God’s Priests in Opposition
to Heretics; Namely, Those Who, After the Custom Prevailing Among
Heretics, Began Their Heresy and Schisms with the Contempt of One Bishop in
the Church.2523</p>
<p>1. I have read your letter, dearest brother, which you sent by Saturus our brother the
acolyte, abundantly full of fraternal love and ecclesiastical discipline and priestly reproof;
in which you signified that Felicissimus,2524 no new enemy of Christ, but long ago excommunicated
for his very many and grave crimes, and condemned not only by my judgment,
but also by that of very many of my fellow-bishops, has been rejected by you there, and that
when he came attended by a band and faction of desperadoes, he was driven from the Church
with the full rigour with which it behoves a bishop to act. From which Church long ago he
was driven, with others like himself, by the majesty of God and the severity of Christ our
Lord and Judge; that the author of schism and disagreement, the fraudulent user of money
entrusted to him, the violator of virgins, the destroyer and corrupter of many marriages,
should not, by the dishonour of his presence and his immodest and incestuous contact, violate
further the spouse of Christ, hitherto uncorrupt, holy, modest.</p>
<p>2. But yet, when I read your other letter, brother, which you subjoined to your first one,
I was considerably surprised at observing that you were in some degree disturbed by the
threats and terrors of those who had come, when, according to what you wrote, they had
attacked and threatened you with the greatest desperation, that if you would not receive the
letters which they had brought, they would read them publicly, and would utter many base
and disgraceful things, and such as were worthy of their mouth. But if the matter is thus,
dearest brother, that the audacity of the most wicked men is to be dreaded, and that what
evil men cannot do rightly and equitably, they may accomplish by daring and desperation,
there is an end of the vigour of the episcopacy, and of the sublime and divine power of
governing the Church; nor can we continue any longer, or in fact now be Christians, if it is
come to this, that we are to be afraid of the threats or the snares of outcasts. For both Gentiles

<pb n="831"/>
and Jews threaten, and heretics and all those, of whose hearts and minds the devil has taken
possession, daily attest their venomous madness with furious voice. We are not, therefore,
to yield because they threaten; nor is the adversary and enemy on that account greater than
Christ, because he claims for himself and assumes so much in the world. There ought to
abide with us, dearest brother, an immoveable strength of faith; and against all the irruptions
and onsets of the waves that roar against us, a steady and unshaken courage should plant
itself as with the fortitude and mass of a resisting rock. Nor does it matter whence comes
the terror or the danger to a bishop, who lives subject to terrors and dangers, and is nevertheless
made glorious by those very terrors and dangers. For we ought not to consider and
regard the mere threats of the Gentiles or of the Jews, when we see that the Lord Himself
was deserted by His brethren, and was betrayed by him whom He Himself had chosen
among His apostles; that also in the beginning of the world it was none other than a brother
who slew righteous Abel, and an angry brother pursued the fleeing Jacob, and the youthful
Joseph was sold by the act of his brethren. In the Gospel also we read that it was foretold
that our foes should rather be of our own household, and that they who have first been associated
in the sacrament of unity2525 shall be they who shall betray one another. It makes
no difference who delivers up or who rages, since God permits those to be delivered up
whom He appoints to be crowned. For it is no ignominy to us to suffer from our brethren
what Christ suffered, nor is it glory to them to do what Judas did. But what insolence it is
in them, what swelling and inflated and vain boasting on the part of these threateners, there
to threaten me in my absence, when here they have me present in their power! I do not fear
their reproaches with which they daily wound themselves and their own life; I do not tremble
at their clubs and stones and swords, which they brandish with parricidal words: as far as
lies in their power such men are homicides before God. Yet they are not able to slay unless
the Lord have allowed them to slay; and although I must die but once, yet they daily slay
me by their hatred, their words, and their villanies.</p>
<p>3. But, dearest brother, ecclesiastical discipline is not on that account to be forsaken,
nor priestly censure to be relaxed, because we are disturbed with reproaches or are shaken
with terrors; since Holy Scripture meets and warns us, saying, “But he who presumes and
is haughty, the man who boasts of himself, who hath enlarged his soul as hell, shall accomplish
nothing.”2526 And again: “And fear not the words of a sinful man, for his glory shall be dung
and worms. To-day he is lifted up, and to-morrow he shall not be found, because he is turned
into his earth, and his thought shall perish.”2527 And again: “I have seen the wicked exalted,
and raised above the cedars of Libanus: I went by, and, lo, he was not; yea, I sought him,
<note type="footnote">2525 [“The sacramental host of God’s elect.”—The Task, Cowper.]</note>

<note type="footnote">2527 1 Mac. ii. 62, 63.</note>

<pb n="832"/>
and his place was not found.”2528 Exaltation, and puffing up, and arrogant and haughty
boastfulness, spring not from the teaching of Christ who teaches humility, but from the
spirit of Antichrist, whom the Lord rebukes by His prophet, saying, “For thou hast said in
thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will place my throne above the stars of God: I will
sit on a lofty mountain, above the lofty mountains to the north: I will ascend above the
clouds; I will be like the Most High.”2529 And he added, saying, “Yet thou shalt descend
into hell, to the foundations of the earth; and they that see thee shall wonder at thee.”2530
Whence also divine Scripture threatens a like punishment to such in another place, and
says, “For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is injurious and proud,
and upon every one that is lifted up, and lofty.”2531 By his mouth, therefore, and by his
words, is every one at once betrayed; and whether he has Christ in his heart, or Antichrist,
is discerned in his speaking, according to what the Lord says in His Gospel, “O generation
of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart
the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure bringeth forth good things; and
an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.”2532 Whence also that rich
sinner who implores help from Lazarus, then laid in Abraham’s bosom, and established in
a place of comfort, while he, writhing in torments, is consumed by the heats of burning
flame, suffers most punishment of all parts of his body in his mouth and his tongue, because
doubtless in his mouth and his tongue he had most sinned.2533</p>
<p>4. For since it is written, “Neither shall revilers inherit the kingdom of God,”2534 and
again the Lord says in His Gospel, “Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool; and
whosoever shall say, Raca, shall be in danger of the Gehenna of fire,”2535 how can they evade
the rebuke of the Lord the avenger, who heap up such expressions, not only on their brethren,
but also on the priests, to whom is granted such honour of the condescension of God, that
whosoever should not obey his priest, and him that judgeth here for the time, was immediately
to be slain? In Deuteronomy the Lord God speaks, saying, “And the man that will do
presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest or to the judge, whosoever he shall
be in those days, that man shall die; and all the people, when they hear, shall fear, and shall

do no more wickedly.”2536 Moreover, to Samuel when he was despised by the Jews, God
says; “They have not despised thee, but they have despised me.”2537 And the Lord also in
the Gospel says, “He that heareth you, heareth me, and Him that sent me; and he that rejecteth
you, rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me, rejecteth Him that sent me.”2538 And when
he had cleansed the leprous man, he said, “Go, show thyself to the priest.”2539 And when
afterwards, in the time of His passion, He had received a buffet from a servant of the priest,
and the servant said to Him, “Answerest thou the high priest so?”2540 the Lord said nothing
reproachfully against the high priest, nor detracted anything from the priest’s honour; but
rather asserting His own innocence, and showing it, He says, “If I have spoken evil, bear
witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?”2541 Also subsequently, in the Acts of
the Apostles, the blessed Apostle Paul, when it was said to him, “Revilest thou God’s
priest?”2542—although they had begun to be sacrilegious, and impious, and bloody, the Lord
having already been crucified, and had no longer retained anything of the priestly honour
and authority—yet Paul, considering the name itself, however empty, and the shadow, as
it were, of the priest, said, “I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written,
Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.”2543</p>
<p>5. When, then, such and so great examples, and many others, are precedents whereby
the priestly authority and power by the divine condescension is established, what kind of
people, think you, are they who, being enemies of the priests, and rebels against the Catholic
Church, are frightened neither by the threatening of a forewarning Lord, nor by the vengeance
of coming judgment? For neither have heresies arisen, nor have schisms originated, from
any other source than from this, that God’s priest is not obeyed; nor do they consider that
there is one person for the time priest in the Church, and for the time judge in the stead of
Christ;2544 whom, if, according to divine teaching, the whole fraternity should obey, no one
would stir up anything against the college of priests; no one, after the divine judgment, after
the suffrage of the people, after the consent of the co-bishops, would make himself a judge,
not now of the bishop, but of God. No one would rend the Church by a division of the unity

of Christ.2545 No one, pleasing himself, and swelling with arrogance, would found a new
heresy, separate and without, unless any one be of such sacrilegious daring and abandoned
mind, as to think that a priest is made without God’s judgment, when the Lord says in His
Gospel, “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them does not fall to the
ground without the will of your Father.”2546 When He says that not even the least things
are done without God’s will, does any one think that the highest and greatest things are
done in God’s Church either without God’s knowledge or permission, and that priests—that
is, His stewards—are not ordained by His decree? This is not to have faith, whereby we live;
this is not to give honour to God, by whose direction and decision we know and believe that
all things are ruled and governed. Undoubtedly there are bishops made, not by the will of
God, but they are such as are made outside of the Church—such as are made contrary to
the ordinance and tradition of the Gospel, as the Lord Himself in the twelve prophets asserts,
saying, “They have set up a king for themselves, and not by me.”2547 And again: “Their
sacrifices are as the bread of mourning; all that eat thereof shall be polluted.”2548 And the
Holy Spirit also cries by Isaiah, and says, “Woe unto you, children that are deserters. Thus
saith the Lord, Ye have taken counsel, but not of me; and ye have made a covenant, but not
of my Spirit, that ye may add sin to sin.”2549</p>
<p>6. But—I speak to you as being provoked; I speak as grieving; I speak as constrained—
when a bishop is appointed into the place of one deceased, when he is chosen in
time of peace by the suffrage of an entire people, when he is protected by the help of God
in persecution, faithfully linked with all his colleagues, approved to his people by now four
years’ experience in his episcopate; observant of discipline in time of peace; in time of disturbance,
proscribed with the name of his episcopate applied and attached to him; so often
asked for in the circus “for the lions;” in the amphitheatre, honoured with the testimony of
the divine condescension; even in these very days on which I have written this letter to you,
on account of the sacrifices which, by proclaimed edict, the people were commanded to
celebrate, demanded anew in the circus “for the lions” by the clamour of the populace;—when
such a one, dearest brother, is seen to be assailed by some desperate and reckless men, and
by those who have their place outside the Church, it is manifest who assails him: not assuredly
Christ, who either appoints or protects his priests; but he who, as the adversary of
Christ and the foe to His Church, for this purpose persecutes with his malice the ruler of

the Church, that when the pilot is removed, he may rage more atrociously and more violently
with a view to the Church’s dispersion.</p>
<p>7. Nor ought it, my dearest brother, to disturb any one who is faithful and mindful of
the Gospel, and retains the commands of the apostle who forewarns us; if in the last days
certain persons, proud, contumacious, and enemies of God’s priests, either depart from the
Church or act against the Church, since both the Lord and His apostles have previously
foretold that there should be such. Nor let any one wonder that the servant placed over them
should be forsaken by some, when His own disciples forsook the Lord Himself, who performed
such great and wonderful works, and illustrated the attributes of God the Father by
the testimony of His doings. And yet He did not rebuke them when they went away, nor
even severely threaten them; but rather, turning to His apostles, He said, “Will ye also go
away?”2550 manifestly observing the law whereby a man left to his own liberty, and established
in his own choice, himself desires for himself either death or salvation. Nevertheless,
Peter,2551 upon whom by the same Lord the Church had been built, speaking one for all,
and answering with the voice of the Church, says, “Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast
the words of eternal life; and we believe, and are sure that Thou art the Christ, the Son of
the living God:”2552 signifying, doubtless, and showing that those who departed from Christ
perished by their own fault, yet that the Church which believes on Christ, and holds that
which it has once learned, never departs from Him at all, and that those are the Church who
remain in the house of God; but that, on the other hand, they are not the plantation planted
by God the Father, whom we see not to be established with the stability of wheat, but blown
about like chaff by the breath of the enemy scattering them, of whom John also in his epistle
says, “They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, no doubt
they would have continued with us.”2553 Paul also warns us, when evil men perish out of
the Church, not to be disturbed, nor to let our faith be lessened by the departure of the
faithless. “For what,” he says, “if some of them have departed from the faith? Hath their
unbelief made the faith of God of none effect? God forbid! For God is true, but every man
a liar.”2554</p>
<p>8. For our own part, it befits our conscience, dearest brother, to strive that none should
perish going out of the Church by our fault; but if any one, of his own accord and by his
own sin, should perish, and should be unwilling to repent and to return to the Church, that

we who are anxious for their well-being should be blameless in the day of judgment, and
that they alone should remain in punishment who refused to be healed by the wholesomeness
of our advice. Nor ought the reproaches of the lost to move us in any degree to depart from
the right path and from the sure rule, since also the apostle instructs us, saying, “If I should
please men, I should not be the servant of Christ.”2555 There is a great difference whether
one desires to deserve well of men or of God. If we seek to please men, the Lord is offended.
But if we strive and labour that we may please God, we ought to contemn human reproaches
and abuse.</p>
<p>9. But that I did not immediately write to you, dearest brother, about Fortunatus, that
pseudo-bishop, constituted by a few, and those, inveterate heretics, the matter was not such
as ought at once and hastily to be brought under your notice, as if it were great or to be
feared; especially since you already know well enough the name of Fortunatus, who is one
of the five presbyters who some time back deserted from the Church, and were lately excommunicated
by the judgment of our fellow-bishops,2556 men both numerous and entitled to
the greatest respect, who on this matter wrote to you last year. Also you would recognise
Felicissimus, the standard-bearer of sedition, who himself also is comprised in those same
letters long ago written to you by our co-bishops,2557 and who not only was excommunicated
by them here, but moreover was lately driven from the Church by you there. Since I was
confident that these things were in your knowledge, and knew for certain that they abode
in your memory and discipline, I did not think it necessary that the follies of heretics should
be told you quickly and urgently. For indeed it ought not to pertain to the majesty or the
dignity of the Catholic Church, to concern itself with what the audacity of heretics and
schismatics may attempt among themselves. For Novatian’s party is also said to have now
made Maximus the presbyter—who was lately sent to us as an ambassador for Novatian,
and rejected from communion with us—their false bishop in that place; and yet I had not
written to you about this, since all these things are slighted by us; and I had sent to you lately
the names of the bishops appointed there, who with wholesome and sound discipline govern
the brethren in the Catholic Church.2558 And this certainly, therefore, it was decided by the
advice of all of us to write to you, that there might be found a short method of destroying
error and of finding out truth, that you and our colleagues might know to whom to write,
and reciprocally, from whom it behoved you to receive letters; but if any one, except those
whom we have comprised in our letter, should dare to write to you, you would know either

that he was polluted by sacrifice, or by receiving a certificate, or that he was one of the
heretics, and therefore perverted and profane. Nevertheless, having gained an opportunity,
by means of a very great friend and a clerk, I have written to you by Felicianus the acolyte,
whom you had sent with Perseus our colleague, among other matters which were to be
brought under your notice from their party, about that Fortunatus also. But while our
brother Felicianus is either retarded there by the wind or is detained by receiving other letters
from us, he has been forestalled by Felicissimus hastening to you. For thus wickedness always
hastens, as if by its speed it could prevail against innocence.</p>
<p>10. But I intimated to you, my brother, by Felicianus, that there had come to Carthage,
Privatus, an old heretic in the colony of Lambesa, many years ago condemned for many
and grave crimes by the judgment of ninety bishops, and severely remarked upon in the
letters of Fabian and Donatus, also our predecessors, as is not hidden from your knowledge;
2559 who, when he said that he wished to plead his cause before us in the council which
we held on the Ides of May then past, and was not permitted, made for himself that Fortunatus
a pretended bishop, worthy of his college. And there had also come with him a certain
Felix, whom he himself had formerly appointed a pseudo-bishop outside the Church, in
heresy. But Jovinus also, and Maximus, were present as companions with the proved
heretic,2560 condemned for wicked sacrifices and crimes proved against them by the judgment
of nine bishops, our colleagues, and again excommunicated also by many of us last year in
a council. And with these four was also joined Repostus of Suturnica, who not only fell
himself in the persecution, but cast down by sacrilegious persuasion the greatest part of his
people. These five, with a few who either had sacrificed, or had evil consciences, concurred
in desiring Fortunatus as a false bishop for themselves, that so, their crimes agreeing, the
ruler should be such as those who are ruled.</p>
<p>11. Hence also, dearest brother, you may now know the other falsehoods which desperate
and abandoned men have there spread about, that although, of the sacrificers, or of the
heretics, there were not more than five false bishops who came to Carthage, and appointed
Fortunatus as the associate of their madness; yet they, as children of the devil, and full of
lies, dared, as you write, to boast that there were present twenty-five bishops; which falsehood
they boasted here also before among our brethren, saying that twenty-five bishops would
come from Numidia to make a bishop for them. After they were detected and confounded
in this their lie (only five who had made shipwreck coming together, and these being excommunicated
by us), they sailed to Rome with the reward of their lies, as if the truth could not
sail after them, and convict their lying tongues by proof of the certainty. And this, my

brother, is real madness, not to think nor to know that lies do not long deceive, that the
night only lasts so long as until the day brightens; but that when the day is clear and the sun
has arisen, the darkness and gloom give place to light, and the robberies which were going
on through the night cease. In fine, if you were to seek the names from them, they would
have none which they could even falsely give. For such among them is the penury even of
wicked men, that neither of sacrificers nor of heretics can there be collected twenty-five for
them; and yet, for the sake of deceiving the ears of the simple and the absent, the number
is exaggerated by a lie, as if, even if this number were true, either the Church would be
overcome by heretics, or righteousness by the unrighteous.</p>
<p>12. Nor does it behove me, dearest brother, to do like things to them, and to go through
in my discourse those things which they have committed, and still commit, since we have
to consider what it becomes God’s priests to utter and to write. Nor ought grief to speak
among us so much as shame, and I ought not to seem provoked rather to heap together reproaches
than crimes and sins. Therefore I am silent upon the deceits practised in the
Church. I pass over the conspiracies and adulteries, and the various kinds of crimes. That
circumstance alone, however, of their wickedness, in which the cause is not mine, nor man’s,
but God’s, I do not think must be withheld; that from the very first day of the persecution,
while the recent crimes of the guilty were still hot, and not only the devil’s altars, but the
very hands and the mouths of the lapsed, were still smoking with the abominable sacrifices,
they did not cease to communicate with the lapsed, and to interfere with their repentance.
God cries, “He that sacrificeth unto any gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be rooted
out.”2561 And in the Gospel the Lord says, “Whosoever shall deny me, him will I deny.”2562
And in another place the divine indignation and anger are not silent, saying, “To them hast
thou poured out a drink-offering, and to them hast thou offered a meat-offering. Shall I not
be angry with these things? saith the Lord.”2563 And they interfere that God may not be
entreated, who Himself declares that He is angry; they interpose that Christ may not be besought
with prayers and satisfactions, who professes that him who denies Him He will deny.</p>
<p>13. In the very time of persecution we wrote letters on this matter, but we were not attended
to. A full council being held, we decreed, not only with our consent, but also with
our threatening, that the brethren should repent,2564 and that none should rashly grant
peace to those who did not repent. And those sacrilegious persons rush with impious madness
against God’s priests, departing from the Church; and raising their parricidal arms against
the Church, in order that the malice of the devil may consummate their work,2565 take pains

that the divine clemency may not heal the wounded in His Church. They corrupt the repentance
of the wretched men by the deceitfulness of their lies, that it may not satisfy an offended
God—that he who has either blushed or feared to be a Christian before, may not afterwards
seek Christ his Lord, nor he return to the Church who had departed from the Church. Efforts
are used that the sins may not be atoned for with just satisfactions and lamentations, that
the wounds may not be washed away with tears. True peace is done away by the falsehood
of a false peace; the healthful bosom of a mother is closed by the interference of the stepmother,
that weeping and groaning may not be heard from the breast and from the lips of
the lapsed. And beyond this, the lapsed are compelled with their tongues and lips, in the
Capitol2566 wherein before they had sinned, to reproach the priests—to assail with contumelies
and with abusive words the confessors and virgins, and those righteous men who are
most eminent for the praise of the faith, and most glorious in the Church. By which things,
indeed, it is not so much the modesty and the humility and the shame of our people that
are smitten, as their own hope and life that are lacerated. For neither is it he who hears, but
he who utters the reproach, that is wretched; nor is it he who is smitten by his brother, but
he who smites a brother, that is a sinner under the law; and when the guilty do a wrong to
the innocent, they suffer the injury who think that they are doing it. Finally, their mind is
smitten by these things, and their spirit is dull, and their sense of right is estranged: it is
God’s wrath that they do not perceive their sins, lest repentance should follow as it is written,
“And God gave them the spirit of torpor,”2567 that is, that they may not return and be healed,
and be made whole after their sins by just prayers and satisfactions. Paul the apostle in his
epistle lays it down, and says, “They received not the love of the truth, that they might be
saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a
lie: that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”
2568 The highest degree of happiness is, not to sin; the second, to acknowledge our
sins. In the former, innocence flows pure and unstained to preserve us; in the latter, there
comes a medicine to heal us. Both of these they have lost by offending God, both because
the grace is lost which is received from the sanctification of baptism, and repentance comes
not to their help, whereby the sin is healed. Think you, brother, that their wickednesses
against God are trifling, their sins small and moderate—since by their means the majesty
of an angry God is not besought, since the anger and the fire and the day of the Lord is not
feared—since, when Antichrist is at hand the faith of the militant people is disarmed by the
taking away of the power of Christ and His fear? Let the laity see to it how they may amend

this.2569 A heavier labour is incumbent on the priests in asserting and maintaining the
majesty of God, that we seem not to neglect anything in this respect, when God admonishes
us, and says, “And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you. If ye will not hear, and
if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord, I will even send a
curse upon you, and I will curse your blessing.”2570 Is honour, then, given to God when the
majesty and decree of God are so condemned, that when He declares that He is indignant
and angry with those who sacrifice, and when He threatens eternal penalties and perpetual
punishments, it is proposed by the sacrilegious, and said, Let not the wrath of God be considered,
let not the judgment of the Lord be feared, let not any knock at the Church of Christ;
but repentance being done away with, and no confession of sin being made, the bishops
being despised and trodden under foot, let peace be proclaimed by the presbyters in deceitful
words; and lest the lapsed should rise up, or those placed without should return to the
Church, let communion be offered to those who are not in communion?</p>
<p>14. To these also it was not sufficient that they had withdrawn from the Gospel, that
they had taken away from the lapsed the hope of satisfaction and repentance, that they had
taken away those involved in frauds or stained with adulteries, or polluted with the deadly
contagion of sacrifices, lest they should entreat God, or make confession of their crimes in
the Church, from all feeling and fruit of repentance; that they had set up2571 outside for
themselves—outside the Church, and opposed to the Church, a conventicle of their abandoned
faction, when there had flowed together a band of creatures with evil consciences,
and unwilling to entreat and to satisfy God. After such things as these, moreover, they still
dare—a false bishop having been appointed for them by heretics—to set sail and to bear
letters from schismatic and profane persons to the throne of Peter, and to the chief church
whence priestly unity takes its source;2572 and not to consider that these were the Romans
whose faith was praised in the preaching of the apostle, to whom faithlessness could have
no access.2573 But what was the reason of their coming and announcing the making of the
pseudo-bishop in opposition to the bishops? For either they are pleased with what they have
done, and persist in their wickedness; or, if they are displeased and retreat, they know

whither they may return. For, as it has been decreed by all of us2574—and is equally fair and
just—that the case of every one should be heard there where the crime has been committed;
and a portion of the flock has been assigned to each individual pastor, which he is to rule
and govern, having to give account of his doing to the Lord; it certainly behoves those over
whom we are placed not to run about nor to break up the harmonious agreement of the
bishops with their crafty and deceitful rashness, but there to plead their cause, where they
may be able to have both accusers and witnesses of their crime; unless perchance the authority
of the bishops constituted in Africa seems to a few desperate and abandoned men to be too
little,2575 who have already judged concerning them, and have lately condemned, by the
gravity of their judgment, their conscience bound in many bonds of sins. Already their case
has been examined, already sentence concerning them has been pronounced; nor is it fitting
for the dignity of priests to be blamed for the levity of a changeable and inconstant mind,
when the Lord teaches and says, “Let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay.”2576</p>
<p>15. If the number of those who judged concerning them last year be reckoned with the
presbyters and deacons, then there were more present to the judgment and hearing than
are those very same persons who now seem to be associated with Fortunatus. For you ought
to know, dearest brother, that after he was made a pseudo-bishop by the heretics, he was at
once deserted by almost all. For those to whom in past time delusions were offered, and
deceitful words were given, to the effect that they were to return to the Church together;
after they saw that a false bishop was made there, learned that they had been fooled and
deceived, and are daily returning and knocking at the door of the Church; while we, meanwhile,
by whom account is to be given to the Lord, are anxiously weighing and carefully
examining who ought to be received and admitted into the Church. For some are either
hindered by their crimes to such a degree, or they are so obstinately and firmly opposed by
their brethren, that they cannot be received at all except with offence and risk to a great
many. For neither must some putridities be so collected and brought together, that the parts
which are sound and whole should be injured; nor is that pastor serviceable or wise who so
mingles the diseased and affected sheep with his flock as to contaminate the whole flock
with the infection of the clinging evil. (Do not pay attention to their number.2577 For one

who fears God is better than a thousand impious sons, as the Lord spoke by the prophet,
saying, “O son, do not delight in ungodly sons, though they multiply to thee, except the fear
of the Lord be with them.”2578) Oh, if you could, dearest brother, be with us here when
those evil and perverse men return from schism, you would see what labour is mine to
persuade patience to our brethren, that they should calm their grief of mind, and consent
to receive and heal the wicked. For as they rejoice and are glad when those who are endurable
and less guilty return, so, on the other hand, they murmur and are dissatisfied as often as
the incorrigible and violent, and those who are contaminated either by adulteries or by
sacrifices, and who, in addition to this, are proud besides, so return to the Church, as to
corrupt the good dispositions within it. Scarcely do I persuade the people; nay, I extort it
from them, that they should suffer such to be admitted. And the grief of the fraternity is
made the more just, from the fact that one and another who, notwithstanding the opposition
and contradiction of the people, have been received by my facility, have proved worse than
they had been before, and have not been able to keep the faith of their repentance, because
they had not come with true repentance.</p>
<p>16. But what am I to say of those who have now sailed to you with Felicissimus, guilty
of every crime, as ambassadors sent by Fortunatus the pseudo-bishop, bringing to you letters
as false as he himself is false, whose letters they bring, as his conscience is full of sins, as his
life is execrable, as it is disgraceful; so that, even if they were in the Church, such people
ought to be expelled from the Church. In addition, since they have known their own conscience,
they do not dare to come to us or to approach to the threshold of the Church, but
wander about, without her, through the province, for the sake of circumventing and defrauding
the brethren; and now, being sufficiently known to all, and everywhere excluded for
their crimes, they sail thither also to you. For they cannot have the face to approach to us,
or to stand before us, since the crimes which are charged upon them by the brethren are
most grievous and grave. If they wish to undergo our judgment, let them come. Finally, if
they can find any excuse or defence, let us see what thought they have of making satisfaction,
what fruit of repentance they bring forward. The Church is neither closed here to any one,
nor is the bishop denied to any. Our patience, and facility, and humanity are ready for those
who come. I entreat all to return into the Church. I beg all our fellow-soldiers to be included
within the camp of Christ, and the dwelling-place of God the Father. I remit everything. I
shut my eyes to many things, with the desire and the wish to gather together the brotherhood.
Even those things which are committed against God I do not investigate with the full judgment
of religion. I almost sin myself, in remitting sins2579 more than I ought. I embrace

<pb n="843"/>
with prompt and full love those who return with repentance, confessing their sin with lowly
and unaffected atonement.2580</p>
<p>17. But if there are some who think that they can return to the Church not with prayers
but with threats, or suppose that they can make a way for themselves, not with lamentation
and atonements, but with terrors, let them take it for certain that against such the Church
of the Lord stands closed; nor does the camp of Christ, unconquered and firm with the
Lord’s protection, yield to threats. The priest of God holding fast the Gospel and keeping
Christ’s precepts may be slain; he cannot be conquered. Zacharias, God’s priest, suggests
and furnishes to us examples of courage and faith, who, when he could not be terrified with
threats and stoning, was slain in the temple of God, at the same time crying out and saying,
what we also cry out and say against the heretics, “Thus saith the Lord, Ye have forsaken
the ways of the Lord, and the Lord will forsake you.”2581 For because a few rash and wicked
men forsake the heavenly and wholesome ways of the Lord, and not doing holy things are
deserted by the Holy Spirit, we also ought not therefore to be unmindful of the divine tradition,
so as to think that the crimes of madmen are greater than the judgments of priests; or
conceive that human endeavours can do more to attack, than divine protection avails to
defend.</p>
<p>18. Is the dignity of the Catholic Church, dearest brother, to be laid aside, is the faithful
and uncorrupted majesty of the people placed within it,2582 and the priestly authority and
power also, all to be laid aside for this, that those who are set without the Church may say
that they wish to judge concerning a prelate in the Church? heretics concerning a Christian?
wounded men about a whole man? maimed concerning a sound man? lapsed concerning
one who stands fast? guilty concerning their judge? sacrilegious men concerning a priest?
What is left but that the Church should yield to the Capitol, and that, while the priests depart
and remove the Lord’s altar, the images and idols should pass over with their altars into the
sacred and venerable assembly of our clergy, and a larger and fuller material for declaiming
against us and abusing us be afforded to Novatian; if they who have sacrificed and have
publicly denied Christ should begin not only to be entreated and admitted without penance
done, but, moreover, in addition, to domineer by the power of their terror?</p>
<p>19. If they desire peace, let them lay aside their arms. If they make atonement, why do
they threaten? or if they threaten, let them know that they are not feared by God’s priests.
For even Antichrist, when he shall begin to come, shall not enter into the Church because

he threatens; neither shall we yield to his arms and violence, because he declares that he will
destroy us if we resist. Heretics arm us when they think that we are terrified by their
threatenings; nor do they cast us down on our face, but rather they lift us up and inflame
us, when they make peace itself worse to the brethren than persecution. And we desire, indeed,
that they may not fill up with crime what they speak in madness, that they who sin
with perfidious and cruel words may not also sin in deeds. We pray and beseech God, whom
they do not cease to provoke and exasperate, that He will soften their hearts, that they may
lay aside their madness, and return to soundness of mind; that their breasts, covered over
with the darkness of sins, may acknowledge the light of repentance, and that they may rather
seek that the prayers and supplications of the priest may be poured out on their behalf, than
themselves pour out the blood of the priest. But if they continue in their madness, and
cruelly persevere in these their parricidal deceits and threats, no priest of God is so weak,
so prostrate, and so abject, so inefficient by the weakness of human infirmity, as not to be
aroused against the enemies and impugners of God by strength from above; as not to find
his humility and weakness animated by the vigour and strength of the Lord who protects
him. It matters nothing to us by whom, or when we are slain, since we shall receive from
the Lord the reward of our death and of our blood. Their concision2583 is to be mourned
and lamented, whom the devil so blinds, that, without considering the eternal punishments
of Gehenna, they endeavour to imitate the coming of Antichrist, who is now approaching.</p>
<p>20. And although I know, dearest brother, from the mutual love which we owe and
manifest one towards another, that you always read my letters to the very distinguished
clergy who preside with you there,2584 and to your very holy and large congregation,2585
yet now I both warn and ask you to do by my request what at other times you do of your
own accord and courtesy; that so, by the reading of this my letter, if any contagion of envenomed
speech and of pestilent propagation has crept in there, it may be all purged out of the
ears and of the hearts of the brethren, and the sound and sincere affection of the good may
be cleansed anew from all the filth of heretical disparagement.</p>
<p>21. But for the rest, let our most beloved brethren firmly decline, and avoid the words
and conversations of those whose word creeps onwards like a cancer; as the apostle says,

condemned of himself.”2587 And the Holy Spirit speaks by Solomon, saying, “A perverse
man carrieth perdition in his mouth; and in his lips he hideth a fire.”2588 Also again, he
warneth us, and says, “Hedge in thy ears with thorns, and hearken not to a wicked
tongue.”2589 And again: “A wicked doer giveth heed to the tongue of the unjust; but a
righteous man does not listen to lying lips.”2590 And although I know that our brotherhood
there,2591 assuredly fortified by your foresight, and besides sufficiently cautious by their
own vigilance, cannot be taken nor deceived by the poisons of heretics, and that the teachings
and precepts of God prevail with them only in proportion as the fear of God is in them; yet,
even although needlessly, either my solicitude or my love persuaded me to write these things
to you, that no commerce should be entered into with such; that no banquets nor conferences
be entertained with the wicked; but that we should be as much separated from them, as they
are deserters from the Church; because it is written, “If he shall neglect to hear the Church,
let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.”2592 And the blessed apostle not only
warns, but also commands us to withdraw from such. “We command you,” he says, “in the
name of Jesus Christ our Lord, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh
disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.”2593 There can be no fellowship
between faith and faithlessness. He who is not with Christ, who is an adversary of Christ,
who is hostile to His unity and peace, cannot be associated with us. If they come with prayers
and atonements, let them be heard; if they heap together curses and threats, let them be rejected.
I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.2594</p>

<p>To the People of Thibaris, Exhorting to Martyrdom.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian First of All Excuses Himself to the Thibaritans that He Had
Not Been to Visit Them, and Gives Them Warning of the Persecution at Hand;
He Then Furnishes Inducements Readily to Undergo Martyrdom.2596</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the people abiding at Thibaris, greeting. I had indeed thought, beloved
brethren, and prayerfully desired—if the state of things and the condition of the times permitted,
in conformity with what you frequently desired—myself to come to you; and being
present with you, then to strengthen the brotherhood with such moderate powers of exhortation
as I possess. But since I am detained by such urgent affairs, that I have not the power
to travel far from this place, and to be long absent from the people over whom by divine
mercy I am placed, I have written in the meantime this letter, to be to you in my stead. For
as, by the condescension of the Lord instructing me, I am very often instigated and warned,
I ought to bring unto your conscience also the anxiety of my warning. For you ought to
know and to believe, and hold it for certain, that the day of affliction has begun to hang over
our heads, and the end2597 of the world and the time of Antichrist to draw near, so that we
must all stand prepared for the battle; nor consider anything but the glory of life eternal,
and the crown of the confession of the Lord; and not regard those things which are coming
as being such as were those which have passed away. A severer and a fiercer fight is now
threatening, for which the soldiers of Christ ought to prepare themselves with uncorrupted
faith and robust courage, considering that they drink the cup of Christ’s blood daily,2598
for the reason that they themselves also may be able to shed their blood for Christ. For this
is to wish to be found with Christ, to imitate that which Christ both taught and did, according
to the Apostle John, who said, “He that saith he abideth in Christ, ought himself also so to
walk even as He walked.”2599 Moreover, the blessed Apostle Paul exhorts and teaches,

Finally, let the reward be considered, which now, moreover, animates and influences us to sustain everything.</note>

saying, “We are God’s children; but if children, then heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.”2600</p>
<p>2. Which things must all now be considered by us, that no one may desire anything
from the world that is now dying, but may follow Christ, who both lives for ever, and
quickens His servants, who are established in the faith of His name. For there comes the
time, beloved brethren, which our Lord long ago foretold and taught us was approaching,
saying, “The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.
And these things they will do unto you, because they have not known the Father nor me.
But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I
told you of them.”2601 Nor let any one wonder that we are harassed with constant persecutions,
and continually tried with increasing afflictions, when the Lord before predicted that
these things would happen in the last times, and has instructed us for the warfare by the
teaching and exhortation of His words. Peter also, His apostle, has taught that persecutions
occur for the sake of our being proved, and that we also should, by the example of righteous
men who have gone before us, be joined to the love of God by death and sufferings. For he
wrote in his epistle, and said, “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
is to try you, nor do ye fall away, as if some new thing happened unto you; but as often as
ye partake in Christ’s sufferings, rejoice in all things, that when His glory shall be revealed,
ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached in the name of Christ, happy
are ye; for the name of the majesty and power of the Lord resteth on you, which indeed on
their part is blasphemed, but on our part is glorified.”2602 Now the apostles taught us those
things which they themselves also learnt from the Lord’s precepts and the heavenly commands,
the Lord Himself thus strengthening us, and saying, “There is no man that hath left
house, or land, or parents, or brethren, or sisters, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of
God’s sake, who shall not receive sevenfold more in this present time, and in the world to
come life everlasting.”2603 And again He says, “Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and
shall separate you from their company, and shall cast you out, and shall reproach your name
as evil for the Son of man’s sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy; for, behold your
reward is great in heaven.”2604</p>
<p>3. The Lord desired that we should rejoice and leap for joy in persecutions, because,
when persecutions occur, then are given the crowns of faith, then the soldiers of God are
proved, then the heavens are opened to martyrs. For we have not in such a way given our

name to warfare that we ought only to think about peace and draw back from and refuse
war, when in this very warfare the Lord walked first—the Teacher of humility, and endurance,
and suffering—so that what He taught to be done, He first of all did, and what He exhorts
to suffer, He Himself first suffered for us. Let it be before your eyes beloved brethren, that
He who alone received all judgment from the Father, and who will come to judge, has already
declared the decree of His judgment and of His future recognition, foretelling and testifying
that He will confess those before His Father who confess Him, and will deny those who
deny Him. If we could escape death, we might reasonably fear to die. But since, on the other
hand, it is necessary that a mortal man should die, we should embrace the occasion that
comes by the divine promise and condescension, and accomplish the ending provided by
death with the reward of immortality; nor fear to be slain, since we are sure when we are
slain to be crowned.</p>
<p>4. Nor let any one, beloved brethren, when he beholds our people driven away and
scattered by the fear of persecution, be disturbed at seeing the brotherhood gathered together,
nor the bishops discoursing.2605 All are not able to be there together, who may not kill, but
who must be killed. Wherever, in those days, each one of the brethren shall be separated
from the flock for a time, by the necessity of the season, in body, not in spirit, let him not
be moved at the terror of that flight; nor, if he withdraw and be concealed, let him be alarmed
at the solitude of the desert place. He is not alone, whose companion in flight Christ is; he
is not alone who, keeping God’s temple wheresoever he is, is not without God. And if a
robber should fall upon you, a fugitive in the solitude or in the mountains; if a wild beast
should attack you; if hunger, or thirst, or cold should distress you, or the tempest and the
storm should overwhelm you hastening in a rapid voyage over the seas, Christ everywhere
looks upon His soldier fighting; and for the sake of persecution, for the honour of His name,
gives a reward to him when he dies, as He has promised that He will give in the resurrection.
Nor is the glory of martyrdom less that he has not perished publicly and before many, since
the cause of perishing is to perish for Christ. That Witness who proves martyrs, and crowns
them, suffices for a testimony of his martyrdom.</p>
<p>5. Let us, beloved brethren, imitate righteous Abel, who initiated martyrdoms, he first
being slain for righteousness’ sake. Let us imitate Abraham, the friend of God, who did not
delay to offer his son as a victim with his own hands, obeying God with a faith of devotion.
Let us imitate the three children Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, who, neither frightened by
their youthful age nor broken down by captivity, Judea, being conquered and Jerusalem
taken, overcame the king by the power of faith in his own kingdom; who, when bidden to
worship the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had made, stood forth stronger both
than the king’s threats and the flames, calling out and attesting their faith by these words:
<note type="footnote">2605 [Preaching the eminent duty of true bishops. See letter li. p. 330, note 4, supra.]</note>

<pb n="849"/>
“O king Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. For the God
whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and He will deliver us
out of thine hands, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, that we do not serve thy gods,
nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.”2606 They believed that they might
escape according to their faith, but they added, “and if not,” that the king might know that
they could also die for the God they worshipped. For this is the strength of courage and of
faith, to believe and to know that God can deliver from present death, and yet not to fear
death nor to give way, that faith may be the more mightily proved. The uncorrupted and
unconquered might of the Holy Spirit broke forth by their mouth, so that the words which
the Lord in His Gospel spoke are seen to be true: “But when they shall seize you, take no
thought what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For
it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.”2607 He said that
what we are able to speak and to answer is given to us in that hour from heaven, and supplied;
and that it is not then we who speak, but the Spirit of God our Father, who, as He does not
depart nor is separated from those who confess Him, Himself both speaks and is crowned
in us. So Daniel, too, when he was required to worship the idol Bel, which the people and
the king then worshipped, in asserting the honour of his God, broke forth with full faith
and freedom, saying, “I worship nothing but the Lord my God, who created the heaven and
the earth.”2608</p>
<p>6. What shall we say of the cruel tortures of the blessed martyrs in the Maccabees,2609
and the multiform sufferings of the seven brethren, and the mother comforting her children
in their agonies, and herself dying also with her children? Do not they witness the proofs
of great courage and faith, and exhort us by their sufferings to the triumphs of martyrdom?
What of the prophets whom the Holy Spirit quickened to the foreknowledge of future events?
What of the apostles whom the Lord chose? Since these righteous men were slain for righteousness’
sake, have they not taught us also to die? The nativity of Christ witnessed at once
the martyrdom of infants, so that they who were two years old and under were slain for His
name’s sake. An age not yet fitted for the battle appeared fit for the crown. That it might be
manifest that they who are slain for Christ’s sake are innocent, innocent infancy was put to
death for His name’s sake. It is shown that none is free from the peril of persecution, when
even these accomplished martyrdoms. But how grave is the case of a Christian man, if he,
a servant, is unwilling to suffer, when his Master first suffered; and that we should be unwilling
to suffer for our own sins, when He who had no sin of His own suffered for us! The Son

of God suffered that He might make us sons of God, and the son of man will not suffer that
he may continue to be a son of God! If we suffer from the world’s hatred, Christ first endured
the world’s hatred. If we suffer reproaches in this world, if exile, if tortures, the Maker and
Lord of the world experienced harder things than these, and He also warns us, saying, “If
the world hate you, remember that it hated me before you. If ye were of the world, the world
would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant
is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.”2610
Whatever our Lord and God taught, He also did, that the disciple might not be excused if
he learns and does not.</p>
<p>7. Nor let any one of you, beloved brethren, be so terrified by the fear of future persecution,
or the coming of the threatening Antichrist, as not to be found armed for all things by
the evangelical exhortations and precepts, and by the heavenly warnings. Antichrist is
coming, but above him comes Christ also.2611 The enemy goeth about and rageth, but immediately
the Lord follows to avenge our sufferings and our wounds. The adversary is enraged
and threatens, but there is One who can deliver us from his hands. He is to be feared whose
anger no one can escape, as He Himself forewarns, and says: “Fear not them which kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him which is able to destroy both body
and soul in hell.”2612 And again: “He that loveth his life, shall lose it; and he that hateth his
life in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal.”2613 And in the Apocalypse He instructs
and forewarns, saying, “If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark
in his forehead or in his hand, the same also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
mixed in the cup of His indignation, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in
the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb; and the smoke of their
torments shall ascend up for ever and ever; and they shall have no rest day nor night, who
worship the beast and his image.”2614</p>
<p>8. For the secular contest men are trained and prepared, and reckon it a great glory of
their honour if it should happen to them to be crowned in the sight of the people, and in
the presence of the emperor. Behold a lofty and great contest, glorious also with the reward
of a heavenly crown, inasmuch as God looks upon us as we struggle, and, extending His
view over those whom He has condescended to make His sons, He enjoys the spectacle of
our contest. God looks upon us in the warfare, and fighting in the encounter of faith; His

angels look on us, and Christ looks on us. How great is the dignity, and how great the hap-
piness of the glory, to engage in the presence of God, and to be crowned, with Christ for a
judge! Let us be armed, beloved brethren, with our whole strength, and let us be prepared
for the struggle with an uncorrupted mind, with a sound faith, with a devoted courage. Let
the camp of God go forth to the battle-field which is appointed to us. Let the sound ones be
armed, lest he that is sound should lose the advantage of having lately stood; let the lapsed
also be armed, that even the lapsed may regain what he has lost: let honour provoke the
whole; let sorrow provoke the lapsed to the battle. The Apostle Paul teaches us to be armed
and prepared, saying, “We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against powers, and the
princes of this world and of this darkness, against spirits of wickedness in high places.
Wherefore put on the whole armour, that ye may be able to withstand in the most evil day,
that when ye have done all ye may stand; having your loins girt about with truth, and having
put on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation of the
Gospel of peace; taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery
darts of the wicked one; and the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is
the word of God.”2615</p>
<p>9. Let us take these arms, let us fortify ourselves with these spiritual and heavenly safeguards,
that in the most evil day we may be able to withstand, and to resist the threats of
the devil: let us put on the breastplate of righteousness, that our breast may be fortified and
safe against the darts of the enemy: let our feet be shod with evangelical teaching, and armed,
so that when the serpent shall begin to be trodden and crushed by us, he may not be able
to bite and trip us up: let us bravely bear the shield of faith, by the protection of which,
whatever the enemy darts at us may be extinguished: let us take also for protection of our
head the helmet of salvation, that our ears may be guarded from hearing the deadly edicts;
that our eyes may be fortified, that they may not see the odious images; that our brow may
be fortified, so as to keep safe the sign of God;2616 that our mouth may be fortified, that the
conquering tongue may confess Christ its Lord: let us also arm the right hand with the sword
of the Spirit, that it may bravely reject the deadly sacrifices; that, mindful of the Eucharist,
the hand which has received the Lord’s body2617 may embrace the Lord Himself, hereafter
to receive from the Lord the reward of heavenly crowns.</p>

inspection of His divine knowledge, to send the guilty to Gehenna, and to set on fire our
persecutors with the perpetual burning of a penal fire, but to pay to us the reward of our

to be honoured to receive with Christ, thy Lord God, the joy of eternal salvation and light—to
greet Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the patriarchs, and prophets, and apostles, and
martyrs—to rejoice with the righteous and the friends of God in the kingdom of heaven,
with the pleasure of immortality given to us—to receive there what neither eye hath seen,
nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man! For the apostle announces that
we shall receive greater things than anything that we here either do or suffer, saying, “The
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come hereafter
which shall be revealed in us.”2618 When that revelation shall come, when that glory of God
shall shine upon us, we shall be as happy and joyful, honoured with the condescension of
God, as they will remain guilty and wretched, who, either as deserters from God or rebels
against Him, have done the will of the devil, so that it is necessary for them to be tormented
with the devil himself in unquenchable fire.</p>
<p>11. Let these things, beloved brethren, take hold of our hearts; let this be the preparation
of our arms, this our daily and nightly meditation, to have before our eyes and ever to revolve
in our thoughts and feelings the punishments of the wicked and the rewards and the deservings
of the righteous: what the Lord threatens by way of punishment against those that
deny Him; what, on the other hand, He promises by way of glory to those that confess Him.
If, while we think and meditate on these things, there should come to us a day of persecution,
the soldier of Christ instructed in His precepts and warnings is not fearful for the battle, but
is prepared for the crown. I bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<p>To Cornelius in Exile, Concerning His Confession.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Praises in Cornelius and His People Their Confession of the
Name of Christ Even to Banishment; And Exhorts Them to Constancy and to
Mutual Prayer for One Another, as Well in Respect of the Approaching Day of
Struggle in This Life, as After Death.2620</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Cornelius his brother, greeting. We have been made acquainted, dearest
brother, with the glorious testimonies of your faith and courage, and have received with
such exultation the honour of your confession, that we count ourselves also sharers and
companions in your merits and praises. For as we have one Church, a mind united, and a
concord undivided, what priest does not congratulate himself on the praises of his fellowpriest2621
as if on his own; or what brotherhood would not rejoice in the joy of its brethren?
It cannot be sufficiently declared how great was the exultation and how great the joy here,
when we had heard of your success and bravery, that you had stood forth as a leader of
confession to the brethren there; and, moreover, that the confession of the leader had increased
by the consent of the brethren; so that, while you precede them to glory, you have
made many your companions in glory, and have persuaded the people to become a confessor
by being first prepared to confess on behalf of all; so that we are at a loss what we ought first
of all to commend in you, whether your prompt and decided faith, or the inseparable love
of the brethren. Among you the courage of the bishop going before has been publicly proved,
and the unitedness of the brotherhood following has been shown. As with you there is one
mind and one voice, the whole Roman Church has confessed.2622</p>
<p>2. The faith, dearest brethren, which the blessed apostle commended in you has shone
brightly. He even then in the spirit foresaw this praise of courage and firmness of strength;
and, attesting your merits by the commendation of your future doings, in praising the parents
he provokes the children. While you are thus unanimous, while you are thus brave, you
have given great examples both of unanimity and of bravery to the rest of the brethren. You
have taught them deeply to fear God, firmly to cling to Christ; that the people should be
associated with the priests in peril; that the brethren should not be separated from brethren

in persecution; that a concord, once established, can by no means be overcome; that whatsoever
is at the same time sought for by all, the God of peace will grant to the peaceful. The
adversary had leapt forth to disturb the camp of Christ with violent terror; but, with the
same impetuosity with which he had come, he was beaten back and conquered; and as much
fear and terror as he had brought, so much bravery and strength he also found. He had
thought that he could again overthrow the servants of God, and agitate them in his accustomed
manner, as if they were novices and inexperienced—as if little prepared and little
cautious. He attacked one first, as a wolf had tried to separate the sheep from the flock, as
a hawk to separate the dove from the flying troop; for he who has not sufficient strength
against all, seeks to gain advantage from the solitude of individuals. But when beaten back
as well by the faith as by the vigour of the combined army, he perceived that the soldiers of
Christ are now watching, and stand sober and armed for the battle; that they cannot be
conquered, but that they can die; and that by this very fact they are invincible, that they do
not fear death; that they do not in turn assail their assailants, since it is not lawful for the
innocent even to kill the guilty; but that they readily deliver up both their lives and their
blood; that since such malice and cruelty rages in the world, they may the more quickly
withdraw from the evil and cruel. What a glorious spectacle was that under the eyes of God!
what a joy of His Church in the sight of Christ, that not single soldiers, but the whole camp,
at once went forth to the battle which the enemy had tried to begin! For it is plain that all
would have come if they could have heard, since whoever heard ran hastily and came. How
many lapsed were there restored by a glorious confession! They bravely stood, and by the
very suffering of repentance were made braver for the battle, that it might appear that lately
they had been taken at unawares, and had trembled at the fear of a new and unaccustomed
thing, but that they had afterwards returned to themselves; that true faith and their strength,
gathered from the fear of God, had constantly and firmly strengthened them to all endurance;
and that now they do not stand for pardon of their crime, but for the crown of their suffering.</p>
<p>3. What does Novatian say to these things, dearest brother? Does he yet lay aside his
error? Or, indeed, as is the custom of foolish men, is he more driven to fury by our very
benefits and prosperity; and in proportion as the glory of love and faith grows here more
and more, does the madness of dissension and envy break out anew there? Does the wretched
man not cure his own wound, but wound both himself and his friends still more severely,
clamouring with his tongue to the ruin of the brethren, and hurling darts of poisonous eloquence,
more severe in accordance with the wickedness of a secular philosophy than
peaceable with the gentleness of the Lord’s wisdom,—a deserter of the Church, a foe to
mercy, a destroyer of repentance, a teacher of arrogance, a corrupter of truth, a murderer
of love? Does he now acknowledge who is the priest of God; which is the Church and the
house of Christ; who are God’s servants, whom the devil molests; who the Christians, whom
Antichrist attacks? For neither does he seek those whom he has already subdued, nor does

<pb n="855"/>
he take the trouble to overthrow those whom he has already made his own. The foe and
enemy of the Church despises and passes by those whom he has alienated from the Church,
and led without as captives and conquered; he goes on to harass those in whom he sees
Christ dwell.</p>
<p>4. Even although any one of such should have been seized, there is no reason for his
flattering himself, as if in the confession of the name; since it is manifest that, if people of
this sort should be put to death outside the Church, it is no crown of faith, but is rather a
punishment of treachery. Nor will those dwell in the house of God among those that are of
one mind, whom we see to have withdrawn by the madness of discord from the peaceful
and divine household.</p>
<p>5. We earnestly exhort as much as we can, dearest brother, for the sake of the mutual
love by which we are joined one to another, that since we are instructed by the providence
of the Lord, who warns us, and are admonished by the wholesome counsels of divine mercy,
that the day of our contest and struggle is already approaching, we should not cease to be
instant with all the people in fastings, in watchings, in prayers. Let us be urgent, with constant
groanings and frequent prayers. For these are our heavenly arms, which make us to stand
fast and bravely to persevere. These are the spiritual defences and divine weapons which
defend us. Let us remember one another in concord and unanimity. Let us on both sides
always pray for one another. Let us relieve burdens and afflictions by mutual love, that if
any one of us, by the swiftness of divine condescension, shall go hence the first, our love
may continue in the presence of the Lord, and our prayers for our brethren and sisters not
cease in the presence of the Father’s mercy. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LVII.2623</head>
<p>To Lucius2624 The Bishop of Rome, Returned from Banishment.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian, with His Colleagues, Congratulates Lucius on His Return from
Exile, Reminding Him that Martyrdom Deferred Does Not Make the Glory Less.
Then, Pointing Out that the Martyrdom of Cornelius and the Banishment of
Lucius Had Happened by Divine Direction, for the Confusion of the Novatians,
He Foretells to Him His Own Impending Martyrdom, God So Ordaining It that
It Should Be Consummated Not Away from Home, But Among His Own People.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian, with his colleagues, to Lucius his brother, greeting. We had lately also congratulated
you indeed, dearest brother, when the divine condescension, by a double honour,
appointed you in the administration of God’s Church, as well a confessor as a priest. But
now also we no less congratulate you and your companions, and the whole fraternity, that
the benignant and liberal protection of the Lord has brought you back again to His own
with the same glory, and with praises to you; that so the shepherd might be restored to feed
his flock, and the pilot to manage the ship, and the ruler to govern the people; and that it
might appear that your banishment was so divinely arranged, not that the bishop banished
and driven away should be wanting to the Church, but that he should return to the Church
greater than he had left it.</p>
<p>2. For the dignity of martyrdom was not the less in the case of the three youths, because,
their death being frustrated, they came forth safe from the fiery furnace; nor did Daniel
stand forth uncompleted in the praise he deserved, because, when he had been sent to the
lions for a prey, he was protected by the Lord, and lived to glory. Among confessors of
Christ, martyrdoms deferred do not diminish the merits of confession, but show forth the
greatness of divine protection. We see represented in you what the brave and illustrious
youths announced before the king, that they indeed were prepared to be burnt in the flames,
that they might not serve his gods, nor worship the image which he had made; but that the
God whom they worshipped, and whom we also worship, was able even to rescue them
from the fiery furnace, and to deliver them from the hands of the king, and from imminent
sufferings. This we now find carried out in the faith of your confession, and in the Lord’s
protection over you; so that while you were prepared and ready to undergo all punishment,
yet the Lord withdrew you from punishment, and preserved you for the Church. In your
return the dignity of his confession has not been abridged in the bishop, but the priestly

<note type="footnote">2624 [Hi episcopate lasted not six months. See Eusebius, H. E., vii. 2. He seems to have suffered martyrdom
by the sword.]</note>

<pb n="857"/>
authority has rather increased; so that a priest is assisting at the altar of God, who exhorts
the people to take up the arms of confession, and to submit to martyrdom, not by his words,
but by his deeds; and, now that Antichrist is near, prepares the soldiers for the battle, not
only by the urgency of his speech and his words, but by the example of his faith and courage.</p>
<p>3. We understand, dearest brother, and we perceive with the whole light of our heart,
the salutary and holy plans of the divine majesty, whence the sudden persecution lately arose
there—whence the secular power suddenly broke forth against the Church of Christ and
the bishop Cornelius, the blessed martyr, and all of you; so that, for the confusion and
beating down of heretics, the Lord might show2625 which was the Church—which is its one
bishop chosen by divine appointment—which presbyters are associated with the bishop in
priestly honour—which is the united and true people of Christ, linked together in the love
of the Lord’s flock—who they were whom the enemy would harass; whom, on the other
hand, the devil would spare as being his own. For Christ’s adversary does not persecute and
attack any except Christ’s camp and soldiers; heretics, once prostrated and made his own,
he despises and passes by. He seeks to cast down those whom he sees to stand.</p>
<p>4. And I wish, dearest brother, that the power were now given us to be with you there
on your return, that we ourselves, who love you with mutual love, might, being present with
the rest, also receive the very joyous fruit of your coming. What exultation among all the
brethren there; what running together and embracing of each one as they arrive! Scarcely
can you be satisfied with the kisses of those who cling to you; scarcely can the very faces and
eyes of the people be satiated with seeing. At the joy of your coming the brotherhood there
has begun to recognise what and how great a joy will follow when Christ shall come. For
because His advent will quickly approach, a kind of representation has now gone before in
you; that just as John, His forerunner and preparer of His way, came and preached that
Christ had come, so, now that a bishop returns as a confessor of the Lord, and His priest, it
appears that the Lord also is now returning. But I and my colleagues, and all the brotherhood,
send this letter to you in the stead of us, dearest brother; and setting forth to you by our
letter our joy, we express the faithful inclination of our love here also in our sacrifices and
our prayers, not ceasing to give thanks to God the Father, and to Christ His Son our Lord;
and as well to pray as to entreat, that He who is perfect, and makes perfect, will keep and
perfect in you the glorious crown of your confession, who perchance has called you back
for this purpose, that your glory should not be hidden, if the martyrdom of your confession
should be consummated away from home. For the victim which affords an example to the
brotherhood both of courage and of faith, ought to be offered up when the brethren are
present. We bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LVIII.2626</head>
<p>To Fidus, on the Baptism of Infants.</p>
<p>Argument.—In This Letter Cyprian is Not Establishing Any New Decree; But
Keeping Most Firmly the Faith of the Church, for the Correction of Those Who
Thought that an Infant Must Not Be Baptized Before the Eighth Day After Its
Birth, He Decreed with Some of His Fellow-Bishops, that as Soon as It Was Born
It Might Properly Be Baptized. He Takes Occasion, However, to Refuse to Recall
the Peace that Had Been Granted to One Victor, Although It Had Been Granted
Against the Decrees of Synods Concerning the Lapsed; But Forbids Therapius
the Bishop to Do It in Other Cases.2627</p>
<p>1. Cyprian, and others his colleagues who were present in council, in number sixty-six,
to Fidus their brother, greeting. We have read your letter, dearest brother, in which you intimated
concerning Victor, formerly a presbyter, that our colleague Therapius, rashly at a
too early season, and with over-eager haste, granted peace to him before he had fully repented,
and had satisfied the Lord God, against whom he had sinned; which thing rather disturbed
us, that it was a departure from the authority of our decree,2628 that peace should be granted
to him before the legitimate and full time of satisfaction, and without the request and consciousness
of the people—no sickness rendering it urgent, and no necessity compelling it.
But the judgment being long weighed among us, it was considered sufficient to rebuke
Therapius our colleague for having done this rashly, and to have instructed him that he
should not do the like with any other. Yet we did not think that the peace once granted in
any wise by a priest2629 of God was to be taken away, and for this reason have allowed Victor
to avail himself of the communion granted to him.</p>
<p>2. But in respect of the case of the infants, which you say ought not to be baptized
within the second or third day after their birth, and that the law of ancient circumcision
should be regarded, so that you think that one who is just born should not be baptized and

are the views of Cyprian; and one may see the opposite views, set forth with extreme candor, by Jeremy Taylor
in his Liberty of Prophesying.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2627 This letter was evidently written after both synods concerning the lapsed, of which mention was made
above in Epistle liii.; but whether a long time or a short time after is uncertain, although the context indicates

<pb n="859"/>
sanctified within the eighth day, we all thought very differently in our council. For in this
course which you thought was to be taken, no one agreed; but we all rather judge that the
mercy and grace of God is not to be refused to any one born of man. For as the Lord says
in His Gospel, “The Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them,”2630
as far as we can, we must strive that, if possible, no soul be lost. For what is wanting to him
who has once been formed in the womb by the hand of God? To us, indeed, and to our eyes,
according to the worldly course of days, they who are born appear to receive an increase.
But whatever things are made by God, are completed by the majesty and work of God their
Maker.</p>
<p>3. Moreover, belief in divine Scripture declares to us, that among all, whether infants
or those who are older, there is the same equality of the divine gift. Elisha, beseeching God,
so laid himself upon the infant son of the widow, who was lying dead, that his head was
applied to his head, and his face to his face, and the limbs of Elisha were spread over and
joined to each of the limbs of the child, and his feet to his feet. If this thing be considered
with respect to the inequality of our birth and our body, an infant could not be made equal
with a person grown up and mature, nor could its little limbs fit and be equal to the larger
limbs of a man. But in that is expressed the divine and spiritual equality, that all men are
like and equal, since they have once been made by God; and our age may have a difference
in the increase of our bodies, according to the world, but not according to God; unless that
very grace also which is given to the baptized is given either less or more, according to the
age of the receivers, whereas the Holy Spirit is not given with measure, but by the love and
mercy of the Father alike to all. For God, as He does not accept the person, so does not accept
the age; since He shows Himself Father to all with well-weighed equality for the attainment
of heavenly grace.</p>
<p>4. For, with respect to what you say, that the aspect of an infant in the first days after
its birth is not pure, so that any one of us would still shudder at kissing it,2631 we do not
think that this ought to be alleged as any impediment to heavenly grace. For it is written,
“To the pure all things are pure.”2632 Nor ought any of us to shudder at that which God
hath condescended to make. For although the infant is still fresh from its birth, yet it is not
such that any one should shudder at kissing it in giving grace and in making peace; since
in the kiss of an infant every one of us ought for his very religion’s sake, to consider the still
recent hands of God themselves, which in some sort we are kissing, in the man lately formed
and freshly born, when we are embracing that which God has made. For in respect of the

<pb n="860"/>
observance of the eighth day in the Jewish circumcision of the flesh, a sacrament was given
beforehand in shadow and in usage; but when Christ came, it was fulfilled in truth. For because
the eighth day, that is, the first day after the Sabbath, was to be that on which the Lord
should rise again, and should quicken us, and give us circumcision of the spirit, the eighth
day, that is, the first day after the Sabbath, and the Lord’s day, went before in the figure;
which figure ceased when by and by the truth came, and spiritual circumcision was given
to us.</p>
<p>5. For which reason we think that no one is to be hindered from obtaining grace by that
law which was already ordained, and that spiritual circumcision ought not to be hindered
by carnal circumcision, but that absolutely every man is to be admitted to the grace of Christ,
since Peter also in the Acts of the Apostles speaks, and says, “The Lord hath said to me that
I should call no man common or unclean.”2633 But if anything could hinder men from obtaining
grace, their more heinous sins might rather hinder those who are mature and grown
up and older. But again, if even to the greatest sinners, and to those who had sinned much
against God, when they subsequently believed, remission of sins is granted—and nobody
is hindered from baptism and from grace—how much rather ought we to shrink from
hindering an infant, who, being lately born, has not sinned, except in that, being born after
the flesh according to Adam,2634 he has contracted the contagion of the ancient death at its
earliest birth, who approaches the more easily on this very account to the reception of the
forgiveness of sins—that to him are remitted, not his own sins, but the sins of another.</p>
<p>6. And therefore, dearest brother, this was our opinion in council, that by us no one
ought to be hindered from baptism and from the grace of God, who is merciful and kind
and loving to all. Which, since it is to be observed and maintained in respect of all, we think
is to be even more observed in respect of infants and newly-born persons, who on this very
account deserve more from our help and from the divine mercy, that immediately, on the
very beginning of their birth, lamenting and weeping, they do nothing else but entreat. We
bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<p>To the Numidian Bishops, on the Redemption of Their Brethren from Captivity
Among the Barbarians.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Begins by Deploring the Captivity of the Brethren, of Which
He Had Heard from the Numidian Bishops, and Says that He is Sending Them
a Hundred Thousand Sesterces, Contributed by Brethren and Sisters and Colleagues.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Januarius, Maximus, Proculus, Victor, Modianus, Nemesianus, Nampulus,
and Honoratus, his brethren, greeting. With excessive grief of mind, and not without tears,
dearest brethren, I have read your letter which you wrote to me from the solicitude of your
love, concerning the captivity of our brethren and sisters. For who would not grieve at
misfortunes of that kind, or who would not consider his brother’s grief his own, since the
Apostle Paul speaks, saying, “Whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
or one member rejoice, all the members rejoice with it;”2637 and in another place he says,
“Who is weak, and I am not weak?”2638 Wherefore now also the captivity of our brethren
must be reckoned as our captivity, and the grief of those who are endangered is to be esteemed
as our grief, since indeed there is one body of our union; and not love only, but also religion,
ought to instigate and strengthen us to redeem the members of the brethren.</p>
<p>2. For inasmuch as the Apostle Paul says again, “Know ye not that ye are the temple of
God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”2639—even although love urged us less to
bring help to the brethren, yet in this place we must have considered that it was the temples
of God which were taken captive, and that we ought not by long inactivity and neglect of
their suffering to allow the temples of God to be long captive, but to strive with what powers
we can, and to act quickly by our obedience, to deserve well of Christ our Judge and Lord
and God. For as the Apostle Paul says, “As many of you as have been baptized into Christ
have put on Christ,”2640 Christ is to be contemplated in our captive brethren, and He is to
be redeemed from the peril of captivity who redeemed us from the peril of death; so that
He who took us out of the jaws of the devil, who abides and dwells in us, may now Himself

be rescued and redeemed from the hands of barbarians by a sum of money—who redeemed
us by His cross and blood—who suffers these things to happen for this reason, that our faith
may be tried, whether each one of us will do for another what he would wish to be done for
himself, if he himself were held captive among barbarians. For who that is mindful of humanity,
and reminded of mutual love, if he be a father, will not now consider that his sons
are there; if he be a husband, will not think that his wife is there kept captive, with as much
grief as shame for the marriage tie? But how great is the general grief among all of us, and
suffering concerning the peril of virgins who are kept there, on whose behalf we must bewail
not only the loss of liberty, but of modesty; and must lament the bonds of barbarians less
than the violence of seducers and abominable places, lest the members dedicated to Christ,
and devoted for ever in honour of continence by modest. virtue, should be sullied by the
lust and contagion of the insulter.</p>
<p>3. Our brotherhood, considering all these things according to your letter, and sorrowfully
examining, have all promptly and willingly and liberally gathered together supplies of money
for the brethren, being always indeed, according to the strength of their faith, prone to the
work of God, but now even more stimulated to salutary works by the consideration of so
great a suffering. For since the Lord in His Gospel says, “I was sick, and ye visited me,”2641
with how much greater reward for our work will He say now, “I was captive, and ye redeemed
me!” And since again He says, “I was in prison, and ye came unto me,” how much more
will it be when He begins to say, “I was in the dungeon of captivity, and I lay shut up and
bound among barbarians, and from that prison of slavery you delivered me,” being about
to receive a reward from the Lord when the day of judgment shall come! Finally, we give
you the warmest thanks that you have wished us to be sharers in your anxiety,2642 and in
so great and necessary a work—that you have offered us fruitful fields in which we might
cast the seeds of our hope, with the expectation of a harvest of the most abundant fruits
which will proceed from this heavenly and saving operation. We have then sent you a sum
of one hundred thousand sesterces,2643 which have been collected here in the Church over
which by the Lord’s mercy we preside, by the contributions of the clergy and people established
with us, which you will there dispense with what diligence you may.</p>

<p>4. And we wish, indeed, that nothing of such a kind may happen again, and that our
brethren, protected by the majesty of the Lord, may be preserved safe from perils of this
kind. If, however, for the searching out of the love of our mind, and for the testing of the
faith of our heart, any such thing should happen, do not delay to tell us of it in your letters,
counting it for certain that our church and the whole fraternity here beseech by their prayers
that these things may not happen again; but if they happen, that they will willingly and liberally
render help. But that you may have in mind in your prayers our brethren and sisters
who have laboured so promptly and liberally for this needful work, that they may always
labour; and that in return for their good work you may present them in your sacrifices and
prayers, I have subjoined the names of each one; and moreover also I have added the names
of my colleagues and fellow-priests, who themselves also, as they were present, contributed
some little according to their power, in their own names and the name of their people. And
besides our own amount, I have intimated and sent their small sums, all of whom, in conformity
with the claims of faith and charity, you ought to remember in your supplications
and prayers.2644 We bid you, dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell, and remember us.</p>

<p>To Euchratius, About an Actor.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Forbids an Actor, If He Continue in His Disgraceful Calling, from
Communicating in the Church. Neither Does He Allow It to Be an Excuse for
Him, that He Himself Does Not Practice the Histrionic Art, So Long as He
Teaches It to Others; Neither Does He Excuse It Because of the Want of Means,
Since Necessaries May Be Supplied to Him from the Resources of the Church;
And Therefore, If the Means of the Church There are Not Sufficient, He Recommends
Him to Come to Carthage.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Euchratius his brother, greeting. From our mutual love and your reverence
for me you have thought that I should be consulted, dearest brother, as to my opinion concerning
a certain actor, who, being settled among you, still persists in the discredit of the
same art of his; and as a master and teacher, not for the instruction, but for the destruction
of boys, that which he has unfortunately learnt he also imparts to others: you ask whether
such a one ought to communicate with us. This, I think, neither befits the divine majesty
nor the discipline of the Gospel, that the modesty and credit of the Church should be polluted
by so disgraceful and infamous a contagion. For since, in the law, men are forbidden to put
on a woman’s garment, and those that offend in this manner are judged accursed, how much
greater is the crime, not only to take women’s garments, but also to express base and effeminate
and luxurious gestures, by the teaching of an immodest art.</p>
<p>2. Nor let any one excuse himself that he himself has given up the theatre, while he is
still teaching the art to others. For he cannot appear to have given it up who substitutes
others in his place, and who, instead of himself alone, supplies many in his stead; against
God’s appointment, instructing and teaching in what way a man may be broken down into
a woman, and his sex changed by art,2646 and how the devil who pollutes the divine image
may be gratified by the sins of a corrupted and enervated body. But if such a one alleges
poverty and the necessity of small means, his necessity also can be assisted among the rest
who are maintained by the support of the Church; if he be content, that is, with very frugal
but innocent food. And let him not think that he is redeemed by an allowance to cease from
sinning, since this is an advantage not to us, but to himself. What more he may wish he
must seek thence, from such gain as takes men away from the banquet of Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob, and leads them down, sadly and perniciously fattened in this world, to the

eternal torments of hunger and thirst; and therefore, as far as you can, recall him from this
depravity and disgrace to the way of innocence, and to the hope of eternal life, that he may
be content with the maintenance of the Church, sparing indeed, but wholesome. But if the
Church with you is not sufficient for this, to afford support for those in need, he may
transfer himself to us, and here receive what may be necessary to him for food and clothing,
and not teach deadly things to others without the Church, but himself learn wholesome
things in the Church. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<p>To Pomponius, Concerning Some Virgins.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian, with Some of His Colleagues, Replies to His Colleague Pomponius,
that Virgins Who Had Determined to Maintain Their State with Continency
and Firmness, But Who Had Yet Subsequently Been Found in the Same
Bed with Men, If They Were Still Found to Be Virgins, Should Be Received into
Communion and Admitted to the Church. But If Otherwise, Since They are
Adulterous Towards Christ, They Should Be Compelled to Full Repentance, and
Those Who Should Obstinately Persevere Should Be Ejected from the Church.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian, Cæcilius, Victor, Sedatus, Tertullus, with the presbyters who were present
with them, to Pomponius their brother, greeting. We have read, dearest brother, your letter
which you sent by Paconius our brother, asking and desiring us to write again to you, and
say what we thought of those virgins who, after having once determined to continue in their
condition, and firmly to maintain their continency, have afterwards been found to have remained
in the same bed side by side with men; of whom you say that one is a deacon; and
yet that the same virgins who have confessed that they have slept with men declare that they
are chaste.2648 Concerning which matters, since you have desired our advice, know that
we do not depart from the traditions of the Gospel and of the apostles, but with constancy
and firmness take counsel for our brethren and sisters, and maintain the discipline of the
Church by all the ways of usefulness and safety, since the Lord speaks, saying, “And I will
give you pastors according to mine heart, and they shall feed you with discipline.”2649 And
again it is written, “Whoso despiseth discipline is miserable;2650 and in the Psalms also the
Holy Spirit admonishes and instructs us, saying, “Keep discipline, lest haply the Lord be
angry, and ye perish from the right way, when His anger shall quickly burn against you.”2651</p>
<p>2. In the first place, therefore, dearest brother, both by overseers and people nothing is

according to their own fancy and lust;2652 but that we should faithfully consult for the life
of each one, and not suffer virgins to dwell with men,—I do not say to sleep together, but
to live together2653—since both their weak sex and their age, still critical, ought to be bridled
in all things and ruled by us, lest an occasion should be given to the devil who ensnares us,
and desires to rage over us, to hurt them, since the apostle also says, “Do not give place to
the devil.”2654 The ship is watchfully to be delivered from perilous places, that it may not
be broken among the rocks and cliffs; the baggage must swiftly be taken out of the fire, before
it is burnt up by the flames reaching it. No one who is near to danger is long safe, nor will
the servant of God be able to escape the devil if he has entangled himself in the devil’s nets.
We must interfere at once with such as these, that they may be separated while yet they can
be separated in innocence; because by and by they will not be able to be separated by our
interference, after they have become joined together by a very guilty conscience. Moreover,
what a number of serious mischiefs we see to have arisen hence; and what a multitude of
virgins we behold corrupted by unlawful and dangerous conjunctions of this kind, to our
great grief of mind! But if they have faithfully dedicated themselves to Christ, let them persevere
in modesty and chastity, without incurring any evil report, and so in courage and
steadiness await the reward of virginity. But if they are unwilling or unable to persevere, it
is better that they should marry, than that by their crimes they should fall into the fire.
Certainly let them not cause a scandal to the brethren or sisters, since it is written, “If meat
cause my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my
brother to offend.”2655</p>
<p>3. Nor let any one think that she can be defended by this excuse, that she may be examined
and proved whether she be a virgin; since both the hands and the eyes of the midwives
are often deceived; and if she be found to be a virgin in that particular in which a woman
may be so, yet she may have sinned in some other part of her body, which may be corrupted
and yet cannot be examined. Assuredly the mere lying together, the mere embracing, the
very talking together, and the act of kissing, and the disgraceful and foul slumber of two
persons lying together, how much of dishonour and crime does it confess! If a husband
come upon his wife, and see her lying with another man, is he not angry and raging, and by
the passion of his rage does he not perhaps take his sword into his hand? And what shall
Christ and our Lord and Judge think, when He sees His virgin, dedicated to Him, and
destined for His holiness, lying with another? How indignant and angry is He, and what

penalties does He threaten against such unchaste connections! whose spiritual sword and
the coming day of judgment, that every one of the brethren may be able to escape, we ought
with all our counsel to provide and to strive. And since it behoves all by all means to keep
discipline,2656 much more is it right that overseers and deacons should be careful for this,
that they may afford an example and instruction to others concerning their conversation
and character. For how can they direct the integrity and continence of others, if the corruptions
and teachings of sin begin to proceed from themselves?</p>
<p>4. And therefore you have acted advisedly and with vigour, dearest brother, in excommunicating
the deacon who has often abode with a virgin; and, moreover, the others who
had been used to sleep with virgins. But if they have repented of this their unlawful lying
together, and have mutually withdrawn from one another, let the virgins meantime be
carefully inspected by midwives; and if they should be found virgins, let them be received
to communion, and admitted to the Church; yet with this threatening, that if subsequently
they should return to the same men, or if they should dwell together with the same men in
one house or under the same roof, they should be ejected with a severer censure, nor should
such be afterwards easily received into the Church. But if any one of them be found to be
corrupted, let her abundantly repent, because she who has been guilty of this crime is an
adulteress, not (indeed) against a husband, but against Christ; and therefore, a due time
being appointed, let her afterwards, when confession has been made, return to the Church.
But if they obstinately persevere, and do not mutually separate themselves, let them know
that, with this their immodest obstinacy, they can never be admitted by us into the Church,
lest they should begin to set an example to others to go to ruin by their crimes. Nor let them
think that the way of life or of salvation is still open to them, if they have refused to obey
the bishops and priests, since in Deuteronomy the Lord God says, “And the man that will
do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest or judge, whosoever he shall be in
those days, that man shall die, and all the people shall hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously.”
2657 God commanded those who did not obey His priests to be slain, and
those who did not hearken to His judges who were appointed for the time. And then indeed
they were slain with the sword, when the circumcision of the flesh was yet in force; but now
that circumcision has begun to be of the spirit among God’s faithful servants, the proud and
contumacious are slain with the sword of the Spirit, in that they are cast out of the Church.
For they cannot live out of it, since the house of God is one, and there can be no salvation
to any except in the Church. But the divine Scripture testifies that the undisciplined perish,
because they do not listen to, nor obey wholesome precepts; for it says, “An undisciplined

man loveth not him that correcteth him. But they who hate reproof shall be consumed with
disgrace.”2658</p>
<p>5. Therefore, dearest brother, endeavour that the undisciplined should not be consumed
and perish, that as much as you can, by your salutary counsels, you should rule the brotherhood,
and take counsel of each one with a view to his salvation. Strait and narrow is the way
through which we enter into life, but excellent and great is the reward when we enter into
glory. Let those who have once made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven2659
please God in all things, and not offend God’s priests nor the Lord’s Church by the scandal
of their wickedness. And if, for the present, certain of our brethren seem to be made sorry
by us, let us nevertheless remain in our wholesome persuasion, knowing that an apostle also
has said, “Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?”2660 But if they
shall obey us, we have gained our brethren, and have formed them as well to salvation as to
dignity by our address. But if some of the perverse persons refuse to obey, let us follow the
same apostle, who says, “If I please men, I should not be the servant of Christ.”2661 If we
cannot please some, so as to make them please Christ, let us assuredly, as far as we can,
please Christ our Lord and God, by observing His precepts. I bid you, brother beloved and
much longed-for, heartily farewell in the Lord.2662</p>

<p>Cæcilius, on the Sacrament of the Cup of the Lord.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Teaches, in Opposition to Those Who Used Water in the Lord’s
Supper, that Not Water Alone, But Wine Mixed with Water, Was to Be Offered;
That by Water Was Designated in Scripture, Baptism, But Certainly Not the
Eucharist. By Types Drawn from the Old Testament, the Use of Wine in the
Sacrament of the Lord’s Body is Illustrated; And It is Declared that by the Symbol
of Water is Understood the Christian Congregation.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Cæcilius his brother, greeting. Although I know, dearest brother, that very
many of the bishops who are set over the churches of the Lord by divine condescension,
throughout the whole world, maintain the plan of evangelical truth, and of the tradition of
the Lord, and do not by human and novel institution depart from that which Christ our
Master both prescribed and did; yet since some, either by ignorance or simplicity2664 in
sanctifying the cup of the Lord, and in ministering to the people, do not do that which Jesus
Christ, our Lord and God, the founder and teacher of this sacrifice, did and taught, I have
thought it as well a religious as a necessary thing to write to you this letter, that, if any one
is still kept in this error, he may behold the light of truth, and return to the root and origin
of the tradition of the Lord.2665 Nor must you think, dearest brother, that I am writing my
own thoughts or man’s; or that I am boldly assuming this to myself of my own voluntary
will, since I always hold my mediocrity with lowly and modest moderation. But when anything
is prescribed by the inspiration and command of God, it is necessary that a faithful
servant should obey the Lord, acquitted by all of assuming anything arrogantly to himself,
seeing that he is constrained to fear offending the Lord unless he does what he is commanded.</p>
<p>2. Know then that I have been admonished that, in offering the cup, the tradition of the
Lord2666 must be observed, and that nothing must be done by us but what the Lord first
did on our behalf, as that the cup which is offered in remembrance of Him should be offered
mingled with wine. For when Christ says, “I am the true vine,”2667 the blood of Christ is
assuredly not water, but wine; neither can His blood by which we are redeemed and

quickened appear to be in the cup, when in the cup there is no wine whereby the blood of
Christ is shown forth, which is declared by the sacrament and testimony of all the Scriptures.</p>
<p>3. For we find in Genesis also, in respect of the sacrament in Noe, this same thing was
to them a precursor and figure of the Lord’s passion; that he drank wine; that he was
drunken; that he was made naked in his household; that he was lying down with his thighs
naked and exposed; that the nakedness of the father was observed by his second son, and
was told abroad, but was covered by two, the eldest and the youngest; and other matters
which it is not necessary to follow out, since this is enough for us to embrace alone, that
Noe, setting forth a type of the future truth, did not drink water, but wine, and thus expressed
the figure of the passion of the Lord.</p>
<p>4. Also in the priest Melchizedek we see prefigured the sacrament of the sacrifice of the
Lord, according to what divine Scripture testifies, and says, “And Melchizedek, king of
Salem, brought forth bread and wine.”2668 Now he was a priest of the most high God, and
blessed Abraham. And that Melchizedek bore a type of Christ, the Holy Spirit declares in
the Psalms, saying from the person of the Father to the Son: “Before the morning star I begat
Thee; Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek;”2669 which order is assuredly
this coming from that sacrifice and thence descending; that Melchizedek was a priest of the
most high God; that he offered wine and bread; that he blessed Abraham. For who is more
a priest of the most high God than our Lord Jesus Christ, who offered a sacrifice to God the
Father, and offered that very same thing which Melchizedek had offered, that is, bread and
wine, to wit, His body and blood? And with respect to Abraham, that blessing going before
belonged to our people. For if Abraham believed in God, and it was accounted unto him
for righteousness, assuredly whosoever believes in God and lives in faith is found righteous,
and already is blessed in faithful Abraham, and is set forth as justified; as the blessed Apostle
Paul proves, when he says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
Ye know, then, that they which are of faith, these are the children of Abraham.
But the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, pronounced
before to Abraham that all nations should be blessed in him; therefore they who are of faith
are blessed with faithful Abraham.”2670 Whence in the Gospel we find that “children of
Abraham are raised from stones, that is, are gathered from the Gentiles.”2671 And when the
Lord praised Zacchæus, He answered and said “This day is salvation come to this house,
forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.”2672 In Genesis, therefore, that the benediction,

<pb n="872"/>
in respect of Abraham by Melchizedek the priest, might be duly celebrated, the figure of
Christ’s sacrifice precedes, namely, as ordained in bread and wine; which thing the Lord,
completing and fulfilling, offered bread and the cup mixed with wine, and so He who is the
fulness of truth fulfilled the truth of the image prefigured.</p>
<p>5. Moreover the Holy Spirit by Solomon shows before the type of the Lord’s sacrifice,
making mention of the immolated victim, and of the bread and wine, and, moreover, of the
altar and of the apostles, and says, “Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath underlaid her
seven pillars; she hath killed her victims; she hath mingled her wine in the chalice; she hath
also furnished her table: and she hath sent forth her servants, calling together with a lofty
announcement to her cup, saying, Whoso is simple, let him turn to me; and to those that
want understanding she hath said, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I
have mingled for you.”2673 He declares the wine mingled, that is, he foretells with prophetic
voice the cup of the Lord mingled with water and wine, that it may appear that that was
done in our Lord’s passion which had been before predicted.</p>
<p>6. In the blessing of Judah also this same thing is signified, where there also is expressed
a figure of Christ, that He should have praise and worship from his brethren; that He should
press down the back of His enemies yielding and fleeing, with the hands with which He
bore the cross and conquered death; and that He Himself is the Lion of the tribe of Judah,
and should couch sleeping in His passion, and should rise up, and should Himself be the
hope of the Gentiles. To which things divine Scripture adds, and says, “He shall wash His
garment in wine, and His clothing in the blood of the grape.”2674 But when the blood of the
grape is mentioned, what else is set forth than the wine of the cup of the blood of the Lord?</p>
<p>7. In Isaiah also the Holy Spirit testifies this same thing concerning the Lord’s passion,
saying, “Wherefore are Thy garments red, and Thy apparel as from the treading of the winepress
full and well trodden?”2675 Can water make garments red? or is it water in the winepress
which is trodden by the feet, or pressed out by the press? Assuredly, therefore, mention
is made of wine, that the Lord’s blood may be understood, and that which was afterwards
manifested in the cup of the Lord might be foretold by the prophets who announced it. The
treading also, and pressure of the wine-press, is repeatedly dwelt on; because just as the
drinking of wine cannot be attained to unless the bunch of grapes be first trodden and
pressed, so neither could we drink the blood of Christ unless Christ had first been trampled
upon and pressed, and had first drunk the cup of which He should also give believers to
drink.</p>

<p>8. But as often as water is named alone in the Holy Scriptures, baptism is referred to, as
we see intimated in Isaiah: “Remember not,” says he, “the former things, and consider not
the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing, which shall now spring forth; and ye shall
know it. I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the dry place, to give drink
to my elected people, my people whom I have purchased, that they might show forth my
praise.”2676 There God foretold by the prophet, that among the nations, in places which
previously had been dry, rivers should afterwards flow plenteously, and should provide
water for the elected people of God, that is, for those who were made sons of God by the
generation of baptism.2677 Moreover, it is again predicted and foretold before, that the Jews,
if they should thirst and seek after Christ, should drink with us, that is, should attain the
grace of baptism. “If they shall thirst,” he says, “He shall lead them through the deserts, shall
bring forth water for them out of the rock; the rock shall be cloven, and the water shall flow,
and my people shall drink;”2678 which is fulfilled in the Gospel, when Christ, who is the
Rock, is cloven by a stroke of the spear in His passion; who also, admonishing what was
before announced by the prophet, cries and says, “If any man thirst, let him come and drink.
He that believeth on me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water.” And that it might be more evident that the Lord is speaking there, not of the cup,
but of baptism, the Scripture adds, saying, “But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that
believe on Him should receive.”2679 For by baptism the Holy Spirit is received; and thus by
those who are baptized, and have attained to the Holy Spirit, is attained the drinking of the
Lord’s cup. And let it disturb no one, that when the divine Scripture speaks of baptism, it
says that we thirst and drink, since the Lord also in the Gospel says, “Blessed are they which
do hunger and thirst after righteousness;”2680 because what is received with a greedy and
thirsting desire is drunk more fully and plentifully. As also, in another place, the Lord speaks
to the Samaritan woman, saying, “Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but
whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall not thirst for ever.”2681 By which
is also signified the very baptism of saving water, which indeed is once received, and is not
again repeated. But the cup of the Lord is always both thirsted for and drunk in the Church.</p>
<p>9. Nor is there need of very many arguments, dearest brother, to prove that baptism is
always indicated by the appellation of water, and that thus we ought to understand it, since
<note type="footnote">2676 Isa. xliii. 18–21.</note>

<pb n="874"/>
the Lord, when He came, manifested the truth of baptism and the cup in commanding that
that faithful water, the water of life eternal, should be given to believers in baptism, but,
teaching by the example of His own authority, that the cup should be mingled with a union
of wine and water.2682 For, taking the cup on the eve of His passion, He blessed it, and gave
it to His disciples, saying, “Drink ye all of this; for this is my blood of the New Testament,
which shall be shed for many, for the remission of sins. I say unto you, I will not drink
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day in which I shall drink new wine with you
in the kingdom of my Father.”2683 In which portion we find that the cup which the Lord
offered was mixed, and that that was wine which He called His blood. Whence it appears
that the blood of Christ is not offered if there be no wine in the cup, nor the Lord’s sacrifice
celebrated with a legitimate consecration unless our oblation and sacrifice respond to His
passion. But how shall we drink the new wine of the fruit of the vine with Christ in the
kingdom of His Father, if in the sacrifice of God the Father and of Christ we do not offer
wine, nor mix the cup of the Lord by the Lord’s own tradition?</p>
<p>10. Moreover, the blessed Apostle Paul, chosen and sent by the Lord, and appointed a
preacher of the Gospel truth, lays down these very things in his epistle, saying, “The Lord
Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread; and when He had given thanks,
He brake it, and said, This is my body, which shall be given for you: do this in remembrance
of me. After the same manner also He took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup
is the new testament in my blood: this do, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For
as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye shall show forth the Lord’s death until
He come.”2684 But if it is both enjoined by the Lord, and the same thing is confirmed and
delivered by His apostle, that as often as we drink, we do in remembrance of the Lord the
same thing which the Lord also did, we find that what was commanded is not observed by
us, unless we also do what the Lord did; and that mixing the Lord’s cup in like manner we
do not depart from the divine teaching; but that we must not at all depart from the evangelical
precepts, and that disciples ought also to observe and to do the same things which the
Master both taught and did. The blessed apostle in another place more earnestly and strongly
teaches, saying, “I wonder that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you into grace,
unto another gospel, which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would
pervert the Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any otherwise
than that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema. As we said before, so say I
now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him
be anathema.”2685</p>

<pb n="875"/>
<p>11. Since, then, neither the apostle himself nor an angel from heaven can preach or
teach any otherwise than Christ has once taught and His apostles have announced, I wonder
very much whence has originated this practice, that, contrary to evangelical and apostolical
discipline, water is offered in some places in the Lord’s cup, which water by itself cannot
express the blood of Christ. The Holy Spirit also is not silent in the Psalms on the sacrament
of this thing, when He makes mention of the Lord’s cup, and says, “Thy inebriating cup,
how excellent it is!”2686 Now the cup which inebriates is assuredly mingled with wine, for
water cannot inebriate anybody. And the cup of the Lord in such wise inebriates, as Noe
also was intoxicated drinking wine, in Genesis. But because the intoxication of the Lord’s
cup and blood is not such as is the intoxication of the world’s wine, since the Holy Spirit
said in the Psalm, “Thy inebriating cup,” He added, “how excellent it is,” because doubtless
the Lord’s cup so inebriates them that drink, that it makes them sober; that it restores their
minds to spiritual wisdom; that each one recovers from that flavour of the world to the understanding
of God; and in the same way, that by that common wine the mind is dissolved,
and the soul relaxed, and all sadness is laid aside, so, when the blood of the Lord and the
cup of salvation have been drunk, the memory of the old man is laid aside, and there arises
an oblivion of the former worldly conversation, and the sorrowful and sad breast which
before was oppressed by tormenting sins is eased by the joy of the divine mercy; because
that only is able to rejoice him who drinks in the Church which, when it is drunk, retains
the Lord’s truth.2687</p>
<p>12. But how perverse and how contrary it is, that although the Lord at the marriage
made wine of water, we should make water of wine, when even the sacrament of that thing
ought to admonish and instruct us rather to offer wine in the sacrifices of the Lord. For because
among the Jews there was a want of spiritual grace, wine also was wanting. For the
vineyard of the Lord of hosts was the house of Israel; but Christ, when teaching and showing
that the people of the Gentiles should succeed them, and that by the merit of faith we should
subsequently attain to the place which the Jews had lost, of water made wine; that is, He
showed that at the marriage of Christ and the Church, as the Jews failed, the people of the
nations should rather flow together and assemble: for the divine Scripture in the Apocalypse
declares that the waters signify the people, saying, “The waters which thou sawest, upon
which the whore sitteth, are peoples and multitudes, and nations of the Gentiles, and
tongues,”2688 which we evidently see to be contained also in the sacrament of the cup.</p>
<p>13. For because Christ bore us all, in that He also bore our sins, we see that in the water
is understood the people, but in the wine is showed the blood of Christ. But when the water
<note type="footnote">2686 Ps. xxiii. 5. [Vulgate, “calix inebrians.” Ps. xxii. 5.]</note>

<note type="footnote">2688 Apoc. xvii. 15.</note>

<pb n="876"/>
is mingled in the cup with wine, the people is made one with Christ, and the assembly of
believers is associated and conjoined with Him on whom it believes; which association and
conjunction of water and wine is so mingled in the Lord’s cup, that that mixture cannot any
more be separated. Whence, moreover, nothing can separate the Church—that is, the people
established in the Church, faithfully and firmly persevering in that which they have believed—
from Christ, in such a way as to prevent their undivided love from always abiding
and adhering. Thus, therefore, in consecrating the cup of the Lord, water alone cannot be
offered, even as wine alone cannot be offered. For if any one offer wine only, the blood of
Christ is dissociated from us; but if the water be alone, the people are dissociated from
Christ; but when both are mingled, and are joined with one another by a close union, there
is completed a spiritual and heavenly sacrament. Thus the cup of the Lord is not indeed
water alone, nor wine alone, unless each be mingled with the other; just as, on the other
hand, the body of the Lord cannot be flour alone or water alone, unless both should be
united and joined together and compacted in the mass of one bread; in which very sacrament
our people are shown to be made one, so that in like manner as many grains, collected, and
ground, and mixed together into one mass, make one bread; so in Christ, who is the heavenly
bread, we may know that there is one body, with which our number is joined and united.2689</p>
<p>14. There is then no reason, dearest brother, for any one to think that the custom of
certain persons is to be followed, who have thought in time past that water alone should be
offered in the cup of the Lord. For we must inquire whom they themselves have followed.
For if in the sacrifice which Christ offered none is to be followed but Christ, assuredly it
behoves us to obey and do that which Christ did, and what He commanded to be done,
since He Himself says in the Gospel, “If ye do whatsoever I command you, henceforth I call
you not servants, but friends.”2690 And that Christ alone ought to be heard, the Father also
testifies from heaven, saying, “This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear
ye Him.”2691 Wherefore, if Christ alone must be heard, we ought not to give heed to what
another before us may have thought was to be done, but what Christ, who is before all, first
did. Neither is it becoming to follow the practice of man, but the truth of God; since God
speaks by Isaiah the prophet, and says, “In vain do they worship me, teaching the commandments
and doctrines of men.”2692 And again the Lord in the Gospel repeals this same saying,
and says, “Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.”2693

Moreover, in another place He establishes it, saying, “Whosoever shall break one of these
least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven.”2694 But if we may not break even the least of the Lord’s commandments, how
much rather is it forbidden to infringe such important ones, so great, so pertaining to the
very sacrament of our Lord’s passion and our own redemption, or to change it by human
tradition into anything else than what was divinely appointed! For if Jesus Christ, our Lord
and God, is Himself the chief priest of God the Father, and has first offered Himself a sacrifice
to the Father, and has commanded this to be done in commemoration of Himself, certainly
that priest truly discharges the office of Christ, who imitates that which Christ did; and he
then offers a true and full sacrifice in the Church to God the Father, when he proceeds to
offer it according to what he sees Christ Himself to have offered.</p>
<p>15. But the discipline of all religion and truth is overturned, unless what is spiritually
prescribed be faithfully observed; unless indeed any one should fear in the morning sacrifices,
2695 lest by the taste of wine he should be redolent of the blood of Christ. Therefore
thus the brotherhood is beginning even to be kept back from the passion of Christ in persecutions,
by learning in the offerings to be disturbed concerning His blood and His bloodshedding.
Moreover, however, the Lord says in the Gospel, “Whosoever shall be ashamed
of me, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed.”2696 And the apostle also speaks, saying,
“If I pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.”2697 But how can we shed our blood
for Christ, who blush to drink the blood of Christ?</p>
<p>16. Does any one perchance flatter himself with this notion, that although in the
morning, water alone is seen to be offered, yet when we come to supper we offer the mingled
cup? But when we sup, we cannot call the people together to our banquet, so as to celebrate
the truth of the sacrament in the presence of all the brotherhood.2698 But still it was not in
the morning, but after supper, that the Lord offered the mingled cup. Ought we then to
celebrate the Lord’s cup after supper, that so by continual repetition of the Lord’s supper2699
we may offer the mingled cup? It behoved Christ to offer about the evening of the day, that

the very hour of sacrifice might show the setting and the evening of the world; as it is written
in Exodus, “And all the people of the synagogue of the children of Israel shall kill it in the
evening.”2700 And again in the Psalms, “Let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.”
2701 But we celebrate the resurrection of the Lord in the morning.</p>
<p>17. And because we make mention of His passion in all sacrifices (for the Lord’s passion
is the sacrifice which we offer), we ought to do nothing else than what He did. For Scripture
says, “For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show forth the Lord’s death
till He come.”2702 As often, therefore, as we offer the cup in commemoration of the Lord
and of His passion, let us do what it is known the Lord did. And let this conclusion be
reached, dearest brother: if from among our predecessors any have either by ignorance or
simplicity not observed and kept this which the Lord by His example and teaching has instructed
us to do, he may, by the mercy of the Lord, have pardon granted to his simplicity.
But we cannot be pardoned who are now admonished and instructed by the Lord to offer
the cup of the Lord mingled with wine according to what the Lord offered, and to direct
letters to our colleagues also about this, so that the evangelical law and the Lord’s tradition
may be everywhere kept, and there be no departure from what Christ both taught and did.</p>
<p>18. To neglect these things any further, and to persevere in the former error, what is it
else than to fall under the Lord’s rebuke, who in the psalm reproveth, and says, “What hast
thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy mouth,
seeing thou hatest instruction and castest my words behind thee? When thou sawest a thief,
thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.”2703 For to declare the
righteousness and the covenant of the Lord, and not to do the same that the Lord did, what
else is it than to cast away His words and to despise the Lord’s instruction, to commit not
earthly, but spiritual thefts and adulteries? While any one is stealing from evangelical truth
the words and doings of our Lord, he is corrupting and adulterating the divine precepts, as
it is written in Jeremiah. He says, “What is the chaff to the wheat? Therefore, behold, I am
against the prophets, saith the Lord, who steal my words every one from his neighbour, and
cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness.”2704 Also in the same prophet,
in another place, He says, “She committed adultery with stocks and stones, and yet for all
this she turned not unto me.”2705 That this theft and adultery may not fall unto us also, we
ought to be anxiously careful, and fearfully and religiously to watch. For if we are priests of

God and of Christ, I do not know any one whom we ought rather to follow than God and
Christ, since He Himself emphatically says in the Gospel, “I am the light of the world; he
that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”2706 Lest therefore
we should walk in darkness, we ought to follow Christ, and to observe his precepts, because
He Himself told His apostles in another place, as He sent them forth, “All power is given
unto me in heaven and earth. Go, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all
things whatsoever I have commanded you.”2707 Wherefore, if we wish to walk in the light
of Christ, let us not depart from His precepts and monitions, giving thanks that, while He
instructs for the future what we ought to do, He pardons for the past wherein we in our
simplicity have erred. And because already His second coming draws near to us, His benign
and liberal condescension is more and more illuminating our hearts with the light of
truth.2708</p>
<p>19. Therefore it befits our religion, and our fear, and the place itself, and the office of
our priesthood, dearest brother, in mixing and offering the cup of the Lord, to keep the
truth of the Lord’s tradition, and, on the warning of the Lord, to correct that which seems
with some to have been erroneous; so that when He shall begin to come in His brightness
and heavenly majesty, He may find that we keep what He admonished us; that we observe
what He taught; that we do what He did.2709 I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LXIII.2710</head>
<p>To Epictetus and to the Congregation of Assuræ, Concerning Fortunatianus,
Formerly Their Bishop.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Warns Epictetus and the Congregation of the Assuritans Not to
Allow Fortunatianus, a Lapser, But Their Former Bishop, to Return to His
Episcopate, as Well for Other Reasons as Because It Had Been Decreed that
Lapsed Bishops Should Not Be Admitted to Their Former Rank.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Epictetus his brother, and to the people established at Assuræ, greeting.
I was gravely and grievously disturbed, dearest brethren, at learning that Fortunatianus,
formerly bishop among you, after the sad lapse of his fall, was now wishing to act as if he
were sound, and beginning to claim for himself the episcopate. Which thing distressed me;
in the first place, on his own account, who, wretched man that he is, being either wholly
blinded in the darkness of the devil, or deceived by the sacrilegious persuasion of certain
persons; when he ought to be making atonement, and to give himself to the work of entreating
the Lord night and day, by tears, and supplications, and prayers, dares still to claim to
himself the priesthood which he has betrayed, as if it were right, from the altars of the devil,
to approach to the altar of God. Or as if he would not provoke a greater wrath and indignation
of the Lord against himself in the day of judgment, who, not being able to be a guide to the
brethren in faith and virtue, stands forth as a teacher in perfidy, in boldness, and in temerity;
and he who has not taught the brethren to stand bravely in the battle, teaches those who are
conquered and prostrate not even to ask for pardon; although the Lord says, “To them have
ye poured a drink-offering, and to them have ye offered a meat-offering. Shall I not be angry
for these things? saith the Lord.”2711 And in another place, “He that sacrificeth to any god,
save unto the Lord only, shall be destroyed.”2712 Moreover, the Lord again speaks, and says,
“They have worshipped those whom their own fingers have made: and the mean man boweth
down, and the great man humbleth himself: and I will not forgive them.”2713 In the Apocalypse
also, we read the anger of the Lord threatening, and saying, “If any man worship the
beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the same shall drink
of the wine of the wrath of God mixed in the cup of His anger; and he shall be tormented
with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

<note type="footnote">2713 Isa. ii. 8, 9.</note>

<pb n="881"/>
and the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and ever; neither shall they have
rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image.”2714</p>
<p>2. Since, therefore, the Lord threatens these torments, these punishments in the day of
judgment, to those who obey the devil and sacrifice to idols, how does he think that he can
act as a priest of God who has obeyed and served the priests of the devil; or how does he
think that his hand can be transferred to the sacrifice of God and the prayer of the Lord
which has been captive to sacrilege and to crime, when in the sacred Scriptures God forbids
the priests to approach to sacrifice even if they have been in lighter guilt; and says in Leviticus:
“The man in whom there shall be any blemish or stain shall not approach to offer gifts
to God?”2715 Also in Exodus: “And let the priests which come near to the Lord God sanctify
themselves, lest perchance the Lord forsake them.”2716 And again: “And when they come
near to minister at the altar of the Holy One, they shall not bring sin upon them, lest they
die.”2717 Those, therefore, who have brought grievous sins upon themselves, that is, who,
by sacrificing to idols, have offered sacrilegious sacrifices, cannot claim to themselves the
priesthood of God, nor make any prayer for their brethren in His sight; since it is written
in the Gospel, “God heareth not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth
His will, him He heareth.”2718 Nevertheless the profound gloom of the falling darkness has
so blinded the hearts of some, that they receive no light from the wholesome precepts, but,
once turned away from the direct path of the true way, they are hurried headlong and suddenly
by the night and error of their sins.2719</p>
<p>3. Nor is it wonderful if now those reject our counsels, or the Lord’s precepts, who have
denied the Lord. They desire gifts, and offerings, and gain, for which formerly they watched
insatiably. They still long also for suppers and banquets, whose debauch they belched forth
in the indigestion lately left to the day, most manifestly proving now that they did not before
serve religion, but rather their belly and gain, with profane cupidity. Whence also we perceive
and believe that this rebuke has come from God’s searching out, that they might not continue
to stand at the altar; and any further, as unchaste persons, to have to do with modesty; as
perfidious, to have to do with faith; as profane, with religion; as earthly, with things divine;
as sacrilegious, with things sacred. That such persons may not return again to the profanation
of the altar, and to the contagion of the brethren, we must keep watch with all our powers,
and strive with all our strength, that, as far as in us lies, we may keep them back from this

audacity of their wickedness, that they attempt not any longer to act in the character of
priest; who, cast down to the lowest pit of death, have gone headlong with the weight of a
greater destruction beyond the lapses of the laity.</p>
<p>4. But if, among these insane persons, their incurable madness shall continue, and, with
the withdrawal of the Holy Spirit, the blindness which has begun shall remain in its deep
night, our counsel will be to separate individual brethren from their deceitfulness; and, lest
any one should run into the toils of their error, to separate them from their contagion. Since
neither can the oblation be consecrated where the Holy Spirit is not; nor can the Lord avail
to any one by the prayers and supplications of one who himself has done despite to the Lord.
But if Fortunatianus, either by the blindness induced by the devil forgetful of his crime, or
become a minister and servant of the devil for deceiving the brotherhood, shall persevere
in this his madness, do you, as far as in you lies, strive, and in this darkness of the rage of
the devil, recall the minds of the brethren from error, that they may not easily consent to
the madness of another; that they may not make themselves partakers in the crimes of
abandoned men; but being sound, let them maintain the constant tenor of their salvation,
and of the integrity preserved and guarded by them.2720</p>
<p>5. Let the lapsed, however, who acknowledge the greatness of their sin, not depart from
entreating the Lord, nor forsake the Catholic Church, which has been appointed one and
alone by the Lord; but, continuing in their atonements and entreating the Lord’s mercy, let
them knock at the door of the Church, that they may be received there where once they were,
and may return to Christ from whom they have departed, and not listen to those who deceive
them with a fallacious and deadly seduction; since it is written, “Let no man deceive you
with vain words, for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
disobedience; be not ye therefore partakers with them.”2721 Therefore let no one associate
himself with the contumacious, and those who do not fear God, and those who entirely with
draw from the Church. But if any one should be impatient of entreating the Lord who is
offended, and should be unwilling to obey us, but should follow desperate and abandoned
men, he must take the blame to himself when the day of judgment shall come. For how shall
he be able in that day to entreat the Lord, who has both before this denied Christ, and now
also the Church of Christ, and not obeying bishops sound and wholesome and living, has
made himself an associate and a partaker with the dying? I bid you, dearest brethren and
longed-for, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LXIV.2722</head>
<p>To Rogatianus, Concerning the Deacon Who Contended Against the Bishop.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Warns the Bishop Rogatianus to Restrain the Pride of the
Deacon Who Had Provoked Him with His Insults, and to Compel Him to Repent
of His Boldness; Taking Occasion to Repeat Once More Whatever He Has Said
in the Previous Letter, About the Sacerdotal or Episcopal Power.2723</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to his brother Rogatianus, greeting. I and my colleagues who were present
with me were deeply and grievously distressed, dearest brother, on reading your letter in
which you complained of your deacon, that, forgetful of your priestly station, and unmindful
of his own office and ministry, he had provoked you by his insults and injuries. And you
indeed have acted worthily, and with your accustomed humility towards us, in rather complaining
of him to us; although you have power, according to the vigour of the episcopate
and the authority of your See, whereby you might be justified on him at once, assured that
all we your colleagues would regard it as a matter of satisfaction, whatever you should do
by your priestly power in respect of an insolent deacon, as you have in respect of men of
this kind divine commands. Inasmuch as the Lord God says in Deuteronomy, “And the
man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest or the judge, whoever
he shall be in those days, that man shall die; and all the people, when they hear, shall fear,
and shall no more do impiously.”2724 And that we may know that this voice of God came
forth with His true and highest majesty to honour and avenge His priests; when three of
the ministers2725—Korah, Dathan, and Abiram—dared to deal proudly, and to exalt their
neck against Aaron the priest, and to equal themselves with the priest set over them; they
were swallowed up and devoured by the opening of the earth, and so immediately suffered
the penalty of their sacrilegious audacity. Nor they alone, but also two hundred and fifty
others, who were their companions in boldness, were consumed by a fire breaking forth
from the Lord, that it might be proved that God’s priests are avenged by Him who makes
priests. In the book of Kings also, when Samuel the priest was despised by the Jewish people
on account of his age, as you are now, the Lord in wrath exclaimed, and said, “They have
not rejected thee, but they have rejected me.”2726 And that He might avenge this, He set

over them Saul as a king, who afflicted them with grievous injuries, and trod on the people,
and pressed down their pride with all insults and penalties, that the despised priest might
be avenged by divine vengeance on a proud people.</p>
<p>2. Moreover also Solomon, established in the Holy Spirit, testifies and teaches what is
the priestly authority and power, saying, “Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence His
priests;”2727 and again, “Honour God with all thy soul, and honour His priests.”2728
Mindful of which precepts, the blessed Apostle Paul, according to what we read in the Acts
of the Apostles, when it was said to him, “Revilest thou thus God’s high priest?” answered
and said, “I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not
speak evil of the ruler of thy people.”2729 Moreover, our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, our
King, and Judge, and God, even to the very day of His passion observed the honour to priests
and high priests, although they observed neither the fear of God nor the acknowledgment
of Christ. For when He had cleansed the leper, He said to him, “Go, show thyself to the
priest, and offer the gift.”2730 With that humility which taught us also to be humble, He still
called him a priest whom He knew to be sacrilegious; also under the very sting of His passion,
when He had received a blow, and it was said to Him, “Answerest thou the high priest so?”
He said nothing reproachfully against the person of the high priest, but rather maintained
His own innocence saying, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why
smitest thou me?”2731 All which things were therefore done by Him humbly and patiently,
that we might have an example of humility and patience; for He taught that true priests
were lawfully and fully to be honoured, in showing Himself such as He was in respect of
false priests.</p>
<p>3. But deacons ought to remember that the Lord chose apostles, that is, bishops and
overseers; while apostles appointed for themselves deacons2732 after the ascent of the Lord
into heaven, as ministers of their episcopacy and of the Church. But if we may dare anything
against God who makes bishops, deacons may also dare against us by whom they are made;
and therefore it behoves the deacon of whom you write to repent of his audacity, and to
acknowledge the honour of the priest, and to satisfy the bishop set over him with full humility.
For these things are the beginnings of heretics, and the origins and endeavours of evilminded
schismatics;—to please themselves, and with swelling haughtiness to despise him
who is set over them. Thus they depart from the Church—thus a profane altar is set up

outside—thus they rebel against the peace of Christ, and the appointment and the unity of
God. But if, further, he shall harass and provoke you with his insults, you must exercise
against him the power of your dignity, by either deposing him or excommunicating him.
For if the Apostle Paul, writing to Timothy, said, “Let no man despise thy youth,”2733 how
much rather must it be said by your colleagues to you, “Let no man despise thy age? And
since you have written, that one has associated himself with that same deacon of yours, and
is a partaker of his pride and boldness, you may either restrain or excommunicate him also,
and any others that may appear of a like disposition, and act against God’s priest. Unless,
as we exhort and advise, they should rather perceive that they have sinned and make satisfaction,
and suffer us to keep our own purpose; for we rather ask and desire to overcome
the reproaches and injuries of individuals by clemency and patience, than to punish them
by our priestly power.2734 I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters, and deacons, and people abiding at Furni, greeting. I and
my colleagues who were present with me were greatly disturbed, dearest brethren, as were
also our fellow-presbyters who sate with us, when we were made aware that Geminius Victor,
our brother, when departing this life, had named Geminius Faustinus the presbyter executor
to his will, although long since it was decreed, in a council of the bishops, that no one should
appoint any of the clergy and the ministers of God executor or guardian2736 by his will,
since every one honoured by the divine priesthood, and ordained in the clerical service,
ought to serve only the altar and sacrifices, and to have leisure for prayers and supplications.
For it is written: “No man that warreth for God entangleth himself with the affairs of this
life, that he may please Him to whom he has pledged himself.”2737 As this is said of all men,
how much rather ought those not to be bound by worldly anxieties and involvements, who,
being busied with divine and spiritual things, are not able to withdraw from the Church,
and to have leisure for earthly and secular doings! The form of which ordination and engagement
the Levites formerly observed under the law, so that when the eleven tribes divided
the land and shared the possessions, the Levitical tribe, which was left free for the temple
and the altar, and for the divine ministries, received nothing from that portion of the division;
but while others cultivated the soil, that portion only cultivated the favour of God, and received
the tithes from the eleven tribes, for their food and maintenance, from the fruits
which grew. All which was done by divine authority and arrangement, so that they who
waited on divine services might in no respect be called away, nor be compelled to consider
or to transact secular business. Which plan and rule is now maintained in respect of the
clergy, that they who are promoted by clerical ordination in the Church of the Lord may be
called off in no respect from the divine administration, nor be tied down by worldly anxieties

and matters; but in the honour of the brethren who contribute, receiving as it were tenths
of the fruits, they may not withdraw from the altars and sacrifices, but may serve day and
night in heavenly and spiritual things.</p>
<p>2. The bishops our predecessors religiously considering this, and wholesomely providing
for it, decided that no brother departing should name a cleric for executor or guardian; and
if any one should do this, no offering should be made for him, nor any sacrifice be celebrated
for his repose.2738 For he does not deserve to be named at the altar of God in the prayer of
the priests, who has wished to call away the priests and ministers from the altar. And
therefore, since Victor, contrary to the rule lately made in council by the priests, has dared
to appoint Geminius Faustinus, a presbyter, his executor, it is not allowed that any offering
be made by you for his repose, nor any prayer be made in the church in his name, that so
the decree of the priests, religiously and needfully made, may be kept by us; and, at the same
time, an example be given to the rest of the brethren, that no one should call away to secular
anxieties the priests and ministers of God who are occupied with the service of His altar
and Church. For care will probably be taken in time to come that this happen not with respect
to the person of clerics any more, if what has now been done has been punished. I bid you,
dearest brethren, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LXVI.2739</head>
<p>To Father Stephanus, Concerning Marcianus of Arles, Who Had Joined Himself
to Novatian.</p>
<p>Argument.—As Marcianus, Bishop of Arles, When He Followed the Sect of Novatian,
Had Seduced Many, and by His Schism Had Separated Himself from the Communion
of the Rest of the Bishops, Cyprian Warns Stephanus, that He Should
by Announcing the Excommunication of the Offender, Alike by Rome and
Carthage, Enable the Church at Arles, to Elect Another in His Place; And that
So Peace Might Be Granted, as Well to the Lapsed as to Those Seduced by Him,
Upon Their Repentance, and a Return to the Church Conceded to Them.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to his brother Stephen, greeting. Faustinus our colleague, abiding at Lyons,
has once and again written to me, dearest brother, informing me of those things which also
I certainly know to have been told to you, as well by him as by others our fellow-bishops
established in the same province, that Marcianus, who abides at Arles, has associated himself
with Novatian, and has departed from the unity of the Catholic Church, and from the
agreement of our body and priesthood, holding that most extreme depravity of heretical
presumption, that the comforts and aids of divine love and paternal tenderness are closed
to the servants of God who repent, and mourn, and knock at the gate of the Church with
tears, and groans, and grief; and that those who are wounded are not admitted for the
soothing of their wounds, but that, forsaken without hope of peace and communion, they
must be thrown to become the prey of wolves and the booty of the devil; which matter,
dearest brother, it is our business to advise for and to aid in, since we who consider the divine
clemency, and hold the balance in governing the Church, do thus exhibit the rebuke of
vigour to sinners in such a way as that, nevertheless, we do not refuse the medicine of divine
goodness and mercy in raising the lapsed and healing the wounded.</p>
<p>2. Wherefore it behoves you2740 to write a very copious letter to our fellow-bishops
appointed in Gaul, not to suffer any longer that Marcian, froward and haughty, and hostile
to the divine mercy and to the salvation of the brotherhood, should insult our assembly,
<note type="footnote">2739 Oxford ed.: Ep. lxviii. This epistle does not appear in many mss., and its genuineness has been therefore
doubted. But the style points to Cyprian as its author, and the documents where it is found are among the oldest,

<pb n="889"/>
because he does not yet seem to be excommunicated by us;2741 in that he now for a long
time boasts and announces that, adhering to Novatian, and following his frowardness, he
has separated himself from our communion; although Novatian himself, whom he follows,
has formerly been excommunicated, and judged an enemy to the Church; and when he sent
ambassadors to us into Africa, asking to be received into our communion, he received back
word from a council of several priests who were here present, that he himself had excluded
himself, and could not by any of us be received into communion, as he had attempted to
erect a profane altar, and to set up an adulterous throne, and to offer sacrilegious sacrifices
opposed to the true priest; while the Bishop Cornelius was ordained in the Catholic Church
by the judgment of God, and by the suffrages of the clergy and people. Therefore, if he were
willing to return to a right mind, and to come to himself, he should repent and return to
the Church as a suppliant. How vain it is, dearest brother, when Novatian has lately been
repulsed and rejected, and excommunicated by God’s priests throughout the whole world,
for us still to suffer his flatterers now to jest with us, and to judge of the majesty and dignity
of the Church!</p>
<p>3. Let letters be directed by you into the province and to the people abiding at Arles, by
which, Marcian being excommunicated, another may be substituted in his place, and Christ’s
flock, which even to this day is contemned as scattered and wounded by him, may be gathered
together. Let it suffice that many of our brethren have departed in these late years in those
parts without peace; and certainly let the rest who remain be helped, who groan both day
and night, and beseeching the divine and fatherly mercy, entreat the comfort of our succour.
For, for that reason, dearest brother, the body of priests is abundantly large, joined together
by the bond of mutual concord, and the link of unity; so that if any one of our college should
try to originate heresy, and to lacerate and lay waste Christ’s flock, others may help, and as
it were, as useful and merciful shepherds, gather together the Lord’s sheep into the flock.
For what if any harbour in the sea shall begin to be mischievous and dangerous to ships, by
the breach of its defences; do not the navigators direct their ships to other neighbouring
ports where there is a safe2742 and practicable entrance, and a secure station? Or if, on the
road, any inn should begin to be beset and occupied by robbers, so that whoever should
enter would be caught by the attack of those who lie in wait there; do not the travellers, as
soon as this its character is discovered, seek other houses of entertainment on the road,
which shall be safer, where the lodging is trustworthy, and the inns safe for the travellers?
And this ought now to be the case with us, dearest brother,2743 that we should receive to us
with ready and kindly humanity our brethren, who, tossed on the rocks of Marcian,2744 are

seeking the secure harbours of the Church; and that we afford such a place of entertainment
for the travellers as is that in the Gospel, in which those who are wounded and maimed by
robbers may be received and cherished, and protected by the host.</p>
<p>4. For what is a greater or a more worthy care of overseers, than to provide by diligent
solicitude and wholesome medicine for cherishing and preserving the sheep? since the Lord
speaks, and says, “The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which
was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again
that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost. And my sheep were
scattered because there is no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts of the field,
and none did search or seek after them. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I am against
the shepherds, and I will require my flock at their hands, and cause them to cease from
feeding the flock; neither shall they feed them any more: for I will deliver them from their
mouth, and I will feed them with judgment.”2745 Since therefore the Lord thus threatens
such shepherds by whom the Lord’s sheep are neglected and perish, what else ought we to
do, dearest brother, than to exhibit full diligence in gathering together and restoring the
sheep of Christ, and to apply the medicine of paternal affection to cure the wounds of the
lapsed, since the Lord also in the Gospel warns, and says, “They that be whole need not a
physician, but they that are sick?”2746 For although we are many shepherds, yet we feed one
flock,2747 and ought to collect and cherish all the sheep which Christ by His blood and
passion sought for; nor ought we to suffer our suppliant and mourning brethren to be cruelly
despised and trodden down by the haughty presumption of some, since it is written, “But
the man that is proud and boastful shall bring nothing at all to perfection, who has enlarged
his soul as hell.”2748 And the Lord, in His Gospel, blames and condemns men of that kind,
saying, “Ye are they which justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts: for
that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.”2749 He says
that those are execrable and detestable who please themselves, who, swelling and inflated,
arrogantly assume anything to themselves. Since then Marcian has begun to be of these,
and, allying himself with Novatian, has stood forth as the opponent of mercy and love, let
him not pronounce sentence, but receive it; and let him not so act as if he himself were to
judge of the college of priests, since he himself is judged by all the priests.</p>

<p>5. For the glorious honour of our predecessors, the blessed martyrs Cornelius and Lucius,
must be maintained, whose memory as we hold in honour, much more ought you, dearest
brother, to honour and cherish with your weight and authority, since you have become their
vicar and successor.2750 For they, full of the Spirit of God, and established in a glorious
martyrdom, judged that peace should be granted to the lapsed, and that when penitence
was undergone, the reward of peace and communion was not to be denied; and this they
attested by their letters, and we all everywhere and entirely have judged the same thing. For
there could not be among us a diverse feeling in whom there was one spirit; and therefore
it is manifest that he does not hold the truth of the Holy Spirit with the rest, whom we observe
to think differently. Intimate plainly to us who has been substituted at Arles in the place of
Marcian, that we may know to whom to direct our brethren, and to whom we ought to
write. I bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LXVII.2751</head>
<p>To the Clergy and People Abiding in Spain, Concerning Basilides and Martial.</p>
<p>Argument.—Basilides and Martial, Bishops, Having Lapsed and Become Contaminated
by the Certificates of Idolatry, Cyprian with His Fellow-Bishops Praises the
Clergy and People of Spain that They Had Substituted in Their Place by a Legitimate
Election, Sabinus and Felix; Especially As, According to the Decision of
Cornelius and His Colleagues, Lapsed Bishops Might Indeed Be Received to
Repentance, But Were Prohibited from the Priestly Honour. Moreover, He Alludes
by the Way to Certain Matters About the Ancient Rite of Episcopal Election.
The Context Indicates that This Was Written During the Episcopate of Stephen.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian, Cæcilius, Primus, Polycarp, Nicomedes, Lucilianus, Successus, Sedatus,
Fortunatus, Januarius, Secundinus, Pomponius, Honoratus, Victor, Aurelius, Sattius, Petrus,
another Januarius, Saturninus, another Aurelius, Venantius, Quietus, Rogatianus, Tenax,
Felix, Faustinus, Quintus, another Saturninus, Lucius, Vincentius, Libosus, Geminius,
Marcellus, Iambus, Adelphius, Victoricus, and Paulus, to Felix the presbyter, and to the
peoples abiding at Legio2752 and Asturica,2753 also to Lælius the deacon, and the people
abiding at Emerita,2754 brethren in the Lord, greeting. When we had come together, dearly
beloved brethren, we read your letters, which according to the integrity of your faith and
your fear of God you wrote to us by Felix and Sabinus our fellow-bishops, signifying that
Basilides and Martial, being stained with the certificates of idolatry, and bound with the
consciousness of wicked crimes, ought not to hold the episcopate and administer the
priesthood of God; and you desired an answer to be written to you again concerning these
things, and your solicitude, no less just than needful, to be relieved either by the comfort or
by the help of our judgment. Nevertheless to this your desire not so much our counsels as
the divine precepts reply, in which it is long since bidden by the voice of Heaven and prescribed
by the law of God, who and what sort of persons ought to serve the altar and to celebrate
the divine sacrifices. For in Exodus God speaks to Moses, and warns him, saying,
“Let the priests which come near to the Lord God sanctify themselves, lest the Lord forsake
them.”2755 And again: “And when they come near to the altar of the Holy One to minister

<pb n="893"/>
they shall not bring sin upon them, lest they die.”2756 Also in Leviticus the Lord commands
and says, “Whosoever hath any spot or blemish upon him, shall not approach to offer gifts
to God.”2757</p>
<p>2. Since these things are announced and are made plain to us, it is necessary that our
obedience should wait upon the divine precepts; nor in matters of this kind can human indulgence
accept any man’s person, or yield anything to any one, when the divine prescription
has interfered, and establishes a law. For we ought not to be forgetful what the Lord spoke
to the Jews by Isaiah the prophet, rebuking, and indignant that they had despised the divine
precepts and followed human doctrines. “This people,” he says, honoureth me with their
lips, but their heart is widely removed from me; but in vain do they worship me, teaching
the doctrines and commandments of men.”2758 This also the Lord repeats in the Gospel,
and says, “Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may establish your own tradition.”2759
Having which things before our eyes, and solicitously and religiously considering them, we
ought in the ordinations of priests to choose none but unstained and upright ministers,2760
who, holily and worthily offering sacrifices to God, may be heard in the prayers which they
make for the safety of the Lord’s people, since it is written, “God heareth not a sinner; but
if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth.”2761 On which account
it is fitting, that with full diligence and sincere investigation those should be chosen
for God’s priesthood whom it is manifest God will hear.</p>
<p>3. Nor let the people flatter themselves that they can be free from the contagion of sin,
while communicating with a priest who is a sinner, and yielding their consent to the unjust
and unlawful episcopacy of their overseer, when the divine reproof by Hosea the prophet
threatens, and says, “Their sacrifices shall be as the bread of mourning; all that eat thereof
shall be polluted;”2762 teaching manifestly and showing that all are absolutely bound to the
sin who have been contaminated by the sacrifice of a profane and unrighteous priest. Which,
moreover, we find to be manifested also in Numbers, when Korah, and Dathan, and Abiram
claimed for themselves the power of sacrificing in opposition to Aaron the priest. There
also the Lord commanded by Moses that the people should be separated from them, lest,
being associated with the wicked, themselves also should be bound closely in the same
wickedness. “Separate yourselves,” said He, “from the tents of these wicked and hardened

men, and touch not those things which belong to them, lest ye perish together in their
sins.”2763 On which account a people obedient to the Lord’s precepts, and fearing God,
ought to separate themselves from a sinful prelate, and not to associate themselves with the
sacrifices of a sacrilegious priest, especially since they themselves have the power either of
choosing worthy priests, or of rejecting unworthy ones.</p>
<p>4. Which very thing, too, we observe to come from divine authority, that the priest
should be chosen in the presence of the people under the eyes of all, and should be approved
worthy and suitable by public judgment and testimony; as in the book of Numbers the Lord
commanded Moses, saying, “Take Aaron thy brother, and Eleazar his son, and place them
in the mount, in the presence of all the assembly, and strip Aaron of his garments, and put
them upon Eleazar his son; and let Aaron die there, and be added to his people.”2764 God
commands a priest to be appointed in the presence of all the assembly; that is, He instructs
and shows that the ordination of priests ought not to be solemnized except with the knowledge
of the people standing near, that in the presence of the people either the crimes of the
wicked may be disclosed, or the merits of the good may be declared, and the ordination,
which shall have been examined by the suffrage and judgment of all, may be just and legitimate.
2765 And this is subsequently observed, according to divine instruction, in the Acts
of the Apostles, when Peter speaks to the people of ordaining an apostle in the place of Judas.
“Peter,” it says, “stood up in the midst of the disciples, and the multitude were in one
place.”2766 Neither do we observe that this was regarded by the apostles only in the ordinations
of bishops and priests, but also in those of deacons, of which matter itself also it is
written in their Acts: “And they twelve called together,” it says, “the whole congregation of
the disciples, and said to them;”2767 which was done so diligently and carefully, with the
calling together of the whole of the people, surely for this reason, that no unworthy person
might creep into the ministry of the altar, or to the office of a priest. For that unworthy
persons are sometimes ordained, not according to the will of God, but according to human
presumption, and that those things which do not come of a legitimate and righteous ordination
are displeasing to God, God Himself manifests by Hosea the prophet, saying, “They
have set up for themselves a king, but not by me.”2768</p>

<p>5. For which reason you must diligently observe and keep the practice delivered from
divine tradition and apostolic observance, which is also maintained among us, and almost
throughout all the provinces;2769 that for the proper celebration of ordinations all the
neighbouring bishops of the same province should assemble with that people for which a
prelate is ordained. And the bishop should be chosen in the presence of the people, who
have most fully known the life of each one, and have looked into the doings of each one as
respects his habitual conduct. And this also, we see, was done by you in the ordination of
our colleague Sabinus; so that, by the suffrage of the whole brotherhood,2770 and by the
sentence of the bishops who had assembled in their presence, and who had written letters
to you concerning him, the episcopate was conferred upon him, and hands were imposed
on him in the place of Basilides. Neither can it rescind an ordination rightly perfected, that
Basilides, after the detection of his crimes, and the baring of his conscience even by his own
confession, went to Rome and deceived Stephen our colleague, placed at a distance, and ignorant
of what had been done, and of the truth, to canvass that he might be replaced unjustly
in the episcopate from which he had been righteously deposed.2771 The result of this is, that
the sins of Basilides are not so much abolished as enhanced, inasmuch as to his former sins
he has also added the crime of deceit and circumvention. For he is not so much to be blamed
who has been through heedlessness surprised by fraud, as he is to be execrated who has
fraudulently taken him by surprise. But if Basilides could deceive men, he cannot deceive
God, since it is written, “God is not mocked.”2772 But neither can deceit advantage Martialis,
in such a way as that he who also is involved in great crimes should hold his bishopric, since
the apostle also warns, and says, “A bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God.”2773</p>
<p>6. Wherefore, since as ye have written, dearly beloved brethren, and as Felix and Sabinus
our colleagues affirm, and as another Felix of Cæsar Augusta,2774 a maintainer of the faith
and a defender of the truth, signifies in his letter, Basilides and Martialis have been contaminated
by the abominable certificate of idolatry; and Basilides, moreover, besides the stain
of the certificate, when he was prostrate in sickness, blasphemed against God, and confessed
that he blasphemed; and because of the wound to his own conscience, voluntarily laying
down his episcopate, turned himself to repentance, entreating God, and considering himself

sufficiently happy if it might be permitted him to communicate even as a layman: Martialis
also, besides the long frequenting of the disgraceful and filthy banquets of the Gentiles in
their college, and placing his sons in the same college, after the manner of foreign nations,
among profane sepulchres, and burying them together with strangers, has also affirmed, by
acts which are publicly taken before a ducenarian procurator,2775 that he had yielded himself
to idolatry, and had denied Christ; and as there are many other and grave crimes in which
Basilides and Martialis are held to be implicated; such persons attempt to claim for themselves
the episcopate in vain; since it is evident that men of that kind may neither rule over the
Church of Christ, nor ought to offer sacrifices to God, especially since Cornelius also, our
colleague, a peaceable and righteous priest, and moreover honoured by the condescension
of the Lord with martyrdom, has long ago decreed with us,2776 and with all the bishops
appointed throughout the whole world, that men of this sort might indeed be admitted to
repentance, but were prohibited from the ordination of the clergy, and from the priestly
honour.</p>
<p>7. Nor let it disturb you, dearest brethren, if with some, in these last times, either an
uncertain faith is wavering, or a fear of God without religion is vacillating, or a peaceable
concord does not continue. These things have been foretold as about to happen in the end
of the world; and it was predicted by the voice of the Lord, and by the testimony of the
apostles, that now that the world is failing, and the Antichrist is drawing near, everything
good shall fail, but evil and adverse things shall prosper.2777</p>
<p>8. Yet although, in these last times, evangelic rigour has not so failed in the Church of
God, nor the strength of Christian virtue or faith so languished, that there is not left a portion
of the priests which in no respect gives way under these ruins of things and wrecks of faith;
but, bold and stedfast, they maintain the honour of the divine majesty and the priestly dignity,
with full observance of fear. We remember and keep in view that, although others succumbed
and yielded, Mattathias boldly vindicated God’s law; that Elias, when the Jews gave way and
departed from the divine religion, stood and nobly contended; that Daniel, deterred neither
by the loneliness of a foreign country nor by the harassment of continual persecution, frequently
and gloriously suffered martyrdoms; also that the three youths, subdued neither by
their tender years2778 nor by threats, stood up faithfully against the Babylonian fires, and
conquered the victor king even in their very captivity itself. Let the number either of prevaricators
or of traitors see to it, who have now begun to rise in the Church against the Church,
and to corrupt as well the faith as the truth. Among very many there still remains a sincere

mind and a substantial religion, and a spirit devoted to nothing but the Lord and its God.2779
Nor does the perfidy of others press down the Christian faith into ruin, but rather stimulates
and exalts it to glory, according to what the blessed Apostle Paul exhorts, and says: “For
what if some of these have fallen from their faith: hath their unbelief made the faith of God
of none effect? God forbid. For God is true, but every man a liar.”2780 But if every man is a
liar, and God only true, what else ought we, the servants, and especially the priests, of God,
to do, than forsake human errors and lies, and continue in the truth of God, keeping the
Lord’s precepts?</p>
<p>9. Wherefore, although there have been found some among our colleagues, dearest
brethren, who think that the godly discipline may be neglected, and who rashly hold communion
with Basilides and Martialis, such a thing as this ought not to trouble our faith,
since the Holy Spirit threatens such in the Psalms, saying, “But thou hatest instruction, and
castedst my words behind thee: when thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst unto him, and
hast been partaker with adulterers.”2781 He shows that they become sharers and partakers
of other men’s sins who are associated with the delinquents. And besides, Paul the apostle
writes, and says the same thing: “Whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, injurious, proud,
boasters of themselves, inventors of evil things, who, although they knew the judgment of
God, did not understand that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only
they which commit those things, but they also which consent unto those who do these
things.”2782 Since they, says he, who do such things are worthy of death, he makes manifest
and proves that not only they are worthy of death, and come into punishment who do evil
things, but also those who consent unto those who do such things—who, while they are
mingled in unlawful communion with the evil and sinners, and the unrepenting, are polluted
by the contact of the guilty, and, being joined in the fault, are thus not separated in its penalty.
For which reason we not only approve, but applaud, dearly beloved brethren, the religious
solicitude of your integrity and faith, and exhort you as much as we can by our letters, not
to mingle in sacrilegious communion with profane and polluted priests, but maintain the
sound and sincere constancy of your faith with religious fear. I bid you, dearest brethren,
ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LXVIII.2783</head>
<p>To Florentius Pupianus, on Calumniators.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Clears Himself in the Eyes of Florentius Pupianus from Various
Crimes of Which He is Accused by Him; And Argues the Lightness of His Mind,
in that He Has So Hastily Trusted Calumniators.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian, who is also called Thascius,2784 to Florentius, who is also Pupianus, his
brother, greeting. I had believed, brother, that you were now at length turned to repentance
for having either rashly heard or believed in time past things so wicked, so disgraceful, so
execrable even among Gentiles, concerning me. But even now in your letter I perceive that
you are still the same as you were before—that you believe the same things concerning me,
and that you persist in what you did believe, and, lest by chance the dignity of your eminence
and your martyrdom should be stained by communion with me, that you are inquiring
carefully into my character; and after God the Judge who makes priests, that you wish to
judge—I will not say of me, for what am I?—but of the judgment of God and of Christ. This
is not to believe in God—this is to stand forth as a rebel against Christ and His Gospel; so
that although He says, “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and neither of them falls
to the ground without the will of my Father,”2785 and His majesty and truth prove that even
things of little consequence are not done without the consciousness and permission of God,
you think that God’s priests are ordained in the Church without His knowledge. For to believe
that they who are ordained are unworthy and unchaste, what else is it than to believe that
his priests are not appointed in the Church by God, nor through God?</p>
<p>2. Think you that my testimony of myself is better than that of God? when the Lord
Himself teaches, and says that testimony is not true, if any one himself appears as a witness
concerning himself, for the reason that every one would assuredly favour himself. Nor would
any one put forward mischievous and adverse things against himself, but there may be a
simple confidence of truth if, in what was announced of us, another is the announcer and
witness. “If,” He says, “I bear witness of myself, my testimony is not true; but there is another
who beareth witness of me.”2786 But if the Lord Himself, who will by and by judge all things,

<note type="footnote">2784 It is suggested with some probability, that this form of superscription was intended to rebuke the rudeness
of Florentius, who, in addressing Cyprian, had used his heathen name of Thascius instead of his baptismal name
of Cæcilius, which he had adopted from the presbyter who had been the means of his conversion.</note>

was unwilling to be believed on His own testimony, but preferred to be approved by the
judgment and testimony of God the Father, how much more does it behove His servants to
observe this, who are not only approved by, but even glory in the judgment and testimony
of God! But with you the fabrication of hostile and malignant men has prevailed against the
divine decree, and against our conscience resting upon the strength of its faith, as if among
lapsed and profane persons placed outside the Church, from whose breasts the Holy Spirit
has departed, there could be anything else than a depraved mind and a deceitful tongue,
and venomous hatred, and sacrilegious lies, which whosoever believes, must of necessity be
found with them when the day of judgment shall come.</p>
<p>3. But with respect to what you have said, that priests should be lowly, because both the
Lord and His apostles were lowly; both all the brethren and Gentiles also well know and
love my humility; and you also knew and loved it while you were still in the Church, and
were in communion with me. But which of us is far from humility: I, who daily serve the
brethren, and kindly receive with good-will and gladness every one that comes to the Church;
or you, who appoint yourself bishop of a bishop, and judge of a judge,2787 given for the time
by God? Although the Lord God says in Deuteronomy, “And the man that will do presumptuously,
and will not hearken unto the priests or unto the judge who shall be in those days,
even that man shall die; and all the people, when they hear, shall fear, and do no more presumptuously.”
2788 And again He speaks to Samuel, and says, “They have not despised thee,
but they have despised me.”2789 And moreover the Lord, in the Gospel, when it was said to
Him, “Answerest thou the high priest so?” guarding the priestly dignity, and teaching that
it ought to be maintained, would say nothing against the high priest, but only clearing His
own innocence, answered, saying, “If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well,
why smitest thou me?”2790 The blessed apostle also, when it was said to him, “Revilest thou
God’s high priest?” spoke nothing reproachfully against the priest, when he might have lifted
up himself boldly against those who had crucified the Lord, and who had already sacrificed
God and Christ, and the temple and the priesthood; but even although in false and degraded
priests, considering still the mere empty shadow of the priestly name, he said, “I wist not,
brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler
of thy people.”2791</p>
<p>4. Unless perchance I was a priest to you before the persecution, when you held communion
with me, and ceased to be a priest after the persecution! For the persecution, when it

came, lifted you to the highest sublimity of martyrdom. But it depressed me with the burden
of proscription, since it was publicly declared, “If any one holds or possesses any of the
property of Cæcilius Cyprian, bishop of the Christians;” so that even they who did not believe
in God appointing a bishop, could still believe in the devil proscribing a bishop. Nor do I
boast of these things, but with grief I bring them forward, since you constitute yourself a
judge2792 of God and of Christ, who says to the apostles, and thereby to all chief rulers, who
by vicarious ordination succeed to the apostles: “He that heareth you, heareth me; and he
that heareth me, heareth Him that sent me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me, and
Him that sent me.”2793</p>
<p>5. For from this have arisen, and still arise, schisms and heresies, in that the bishop who
is one2794 and rules over the Church is contemned by the haughty presumption of some
persons; and the man who is honoured by God’s condescension, is judged unworthy by
men. For what swelling of pride is this, what arrogance of soul, what inflation of mind, to
call prelates and priests to one’s own recognition, and unless I may be declared clear in your
sight and absolved by your judgment, behold now for six years the brotherhood has neither
had a bishop, nor the people a prelate,2795 nor the flock a pastor, nor the Church a governor,
nor Christ a representative,2796 nor God a priest! Pupianus must come to the rescue, and
give judgment, and declare the decision of God and Christ accepted, that so great a number
of the faithful who have been summoned away, under my rule, may not appear to have departed
without hope of salvation and of peace; that the new crowd of believers may not be
considered to have failed of attaining any grace of baptism and the Holy Spirit by my ministry;
2797 that the peace conferred upon so many lapsed and penitent persons, and the
communion vouchsafed by my examination, may not be abrogated by the authority of your
judgment. Condescend for once, and deign to pronounce concerning us, and to establish
our episcopate by the authority of your recognition, that God and His Christ may thank
you, in that by your means a representative and ruler has been restored as well to their altar
as to their people.</p>

and weapons! The chief among them is acknowledged and feared, whom no divine judgment
has appointed, but on whom an abandoned faction and a guilty band have agreed.</p>
<p>7. You say, indeed, that the scruple into which you have fallen ought to be taken from
your mind. You have fallen into it, but it was by your irreligious credulity. You have fallen
into it, but it was by your own sacrilegious disposition and will in easily hearkening to unchaste,
to impious, to unspeakable things against your brother, against a priest, and in willingly
believing them in defending other men’s falsehoods, as if they were your own and your
private property; and in not remembering that it is written, “Hedge thine ears with thorns,
and hearken not to a wicked tongue;”2798 and again: “A wicked doer giveth heed to the
tongue of the unjust; but a righteous man regards not lying lips.”2799 Wherefore have not
the martyrs fallen into this scruple, full of the Holy Ghost, and already by their passion near
to the presence of God and of His Christ; martyrs who, from their dungeon, directed letters
to Cyprian the bishop, acknowledging the priest of God, and bearing witness to him?
Wherefore have not so many bishops, my colleagues, fallen into this scruple, who either,
when they departed from the midst of us, were proscribed, or being taken were cast into
prison and were in chains; or who, sent away into exile, have gone by an illustrious road to
the Lord; or who in some places, condemned to death, have received heavenly crowns from
the glorification of the Lord? Wherefore have not they fallen into this scruple, from among
that people of ours which is with us, and is by God’s condescension committed to us—so
many confessors who have been put to the question and tortured, and glorious by the
memory of illustrious wounds and scars; so many chaste virgins, so many praiseworthy
widows; finally, all the churches throughout the whole world who are associated with us in
the bond of unity? Unless all these, who are in communion with me, as you have written,
are polluted with the pollution of my lips, and have lost the hope of eternal life by the contagion
of my communion.2800 Pupianus alone, sound, inviolate, holy, modest, who would
not associate himself with us, shall dwell alone in paradise and in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>8. You have written also, that on my account the Church has now a portion of herself
in a state of dispersion, although the whole people of the Church are collected, and united,
and joined to itself in an undivided concord: they alone have remained without, who even,
if they had been within, would have had to be cast out. Nor does the Lord, the protector of
His people, and their guardian, suffer the wheat to be snatched from His floor; but the chaff
alone can be separated from the Church, since also the apostle says, “For what if some of
them have departed from the faith? shall their unbelief make the faith of God of none effect?
God forbid; for God is true, but every man a liar.”2801 And the Lord also in the Gospel,

when disciples forsook Him as He spoke, turning to the twelve, said, “Will ye also go away?”
then Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the word of eternal life;
and we believe, and are sure, that Thou art the Son of the living God.”2802 Peter speaks there,
on whom the Church was to be built,2803 teaching and showing in the name of the Church,
that although a rebellious and arrogant multitude of those who will not hear and obey may
depart, yet the Church does not depart from Christ; and they are the Church who are a
people united to the priest, and the flock which adheres to its pastor.2804 Whence you ought
to know that the bishop is in the Church, and the Church in the bishop;2805 and if any one
be not with the bishop, that he is not in the Church, and that those flatter themselves in vain
who creep in, not having peace with God’s priests, and think that they communicate secretly
with some; while the Church, which is Catholic and one, is not cut nor divided, but is indeed
connected and bound together by the cement of priests who cohere with one another.</p>
<p>9. Wherefore, brother, if you consider God’s majesty who ordains priests, if you will for
once have respect to Christ, who by His decree and word, and by His presence, both rules
prelates themselves, and rules the Church by prelates; if you will trust, in respect of the innocence
of bishops, not human hatred, but the divine judgment; if you will begin even a
late repentance for your temerity, and pride, and insolence; if you will most abundantly
make satisfaction to God and His Christ whom I serve, and to whom with pure and unstained
lips I ceaselessly offer sacrifices, not only in peace, but in persecution; we may have some
ground for communion with you, even although there still remain among us respect and
fear for the divine censure; so that first I should consult my Lord whether He would permit
peace to be granted to you, and you to be received to the communion of His Church by His
own showing and admonition.</p>
<p>10. For I remember what has already been manifested to me, nay, what has been prescribed
by the authority of our Lord and God to an obedient and fearing servant; and among
other things which He condescended to show and to reveal, He also added this: “Whoso
therefore does not believe Christ, who maketh the priest, shall hereafter begin to believe
Him who avengeth the priest.” Although I know that to some men dreams seem ridiculous
and visions foolish, yet assuredly it is to such as would rather believe in opposition to the

this dreamer cometh; come now therefore, let us slay him.”2806 And afterwards the dreamer
attained to what he had dreamed; and his slayers and sellers were put to confusion, so that
they, who at first did not believe the words, afterwards believed the deeds. But of those things
that you have done, either in persecution or in peace, it is foolish for me to pretend to judge
you, since you rather appoint yourself a judge over us. These things, of the pure conscience

who seem to be baptized by heretics and schismatics, (asking) whether, when they come to
the Catholic Church, which is one,2810 they ought to be baptized. On which matter, although
you yourselves hold thereupon the truth and certainty of the Catholic rule, yet since you
have thought that of our mutual love we ought to be consulted, we put forward our opinion,
not as a new one,2811 but we join with you in equal agreement, in an opinion long since
decreed by our predecessors, and observed by us,—judging, namely, and holding it for certain
that no one can be baptized abroad outside the Church, since there is one baptism appointed
in the holy Church. And it is written in the words of the Lord, “They have forsaken me, the

fountain of living waters, and hewed them out broken cisterns, which can hold no water.”2812
And again, sacred Scripture warns, and says, “Keep thee from the strange water, and drink
not from a fountain of strange water.”2813 It is required, then, that the water should first be
cleansed and sanctified by the priest,2814 that it may wash away by its baptism the sins of
the man who is baptized; because the Lord says by Ezekiel the prophet: “Then will I sprinkle
clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness; and from all your
idols will I cleanse you: a new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
you.”2815 But how can he cleanse and sanctify the water who is himself unclean, and in
whom the Holy Spirit is not? since the Lord says in the book of Numbers, “And whatsoever
the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean.”2816 Or how can he who baptizes give to another
remission of sins who himself, being outside the Church, cannot put away his own
sins?</p>
<p>2. But, moreover, the very interrogation which is put in baptism is a witness of the truth.
For when we say, “Dost thou believe in eternal life and remission of sins through the holy
Church?” we mean that remission of sins is not granted except in the Church, and that
among heretics, where there is no Church, sins cannot be put away. Therefore they who
assert that heretics can baptize, must either change the interrogation or maintain the truth;
unless indeed they attribute a church also to those who, they contend, have baptism. It is
also necessary that he should be anointed who is baptized; so that, having received the
chrism,2817 that is, the anointing, he may be anointed of God, and have in him the grace of
Christ. Further, it is the Eucharist whence the baptized are anointed with the oil sanctified
on the altar.2818 But he cannot sanctify the creature of oil,2819 who has neither an altar nor
a church; whence also there can be no spiritual anointing among heretics, since it is manifest
that the oil cannot be sanctified nor the Eucharist celebrated at all among them. But we
ought to know and remember that it is written, “Let not the oil of a sinner anoint my
head,”2820 which the Holy Spirit before forewarned in the Psalms, lest any one going out of

the way and wandering from the path of truth should be anointed by heretics and adversaries
of Christ. Besides, what prayer can a priest who is impious and a sinner offer for a baptized
person? since it is written, “God heareth not a sinner; but if any man be a worshipper of
God, and doeth His will, him He heareth.”2821 Who, moreover, can give what he himself
has not? or how can he discharge spiritual functions who himself has lost the Holy Spirit?
And therefore he must be baptized and renewed who comes untrained to the Church, that
he may be sanctified within by those who are holy, since it is written, “Be ye holy, for I am
holy, saith the Lord.”2822 So that he who has been seduced into error, and baptized2823
outside of the Church, should lay aside even this very thing in the true and ecclesiastical
baptism, viz., that he a man coming to God, while he seeks for a priest, fell by the deceit of
error upon a profane one.</p>
<p>3. But it is to approve the baptism of heretics and schismatics, to admit that they have
truly baptized. For therein a part cannot be void, and part be valid. If one could baptize, he
could also give the Holy Spirit. But if he cannot give the Holy Spirit, because he that is appointed
without is not endowed with the Holy Spirit, he cannot baptize those who come;
since both baptism is one and the Holy Spirit is one, and the Church founded by Christ the
Lord upon Peter, by a source and principle of unity,2824 is one also. Hence it results, that
since with them all things are futile and false, nothing of that which they have done ought
to be approved by us. For what can be ratified and established by God which is done by
them whom the Lord calls His enemies and adversaries? setting forth in His Gospel, “He
that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.”2825 And
the blessed Apostle John also, keeping the commandments and precepts of the Lord, has
laid it down in his epistle, and said, “Ye have heard that antichrist shall come: even now
there are many Antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from
us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, no doubt they would have continued
with us.”2826 Whence we also ought to gather and consider whether they who are the Lord’s
adversaries, and are called antichrists, can give the grace of Christ. Wherefore we who are
with the Lord, and maintain the unity of the Lord, and according to His condescension administer
His priesthood in the Church, ought to repudiate and reject and regard as profane
whatever His adversaries and the antichrists do; and to those who, coming out of error and

<head>Epistle LXX.2828</head>
<p>To Quintus, Concerning the Baptism of Heretics.</p>
<p>Argument.—An Answer is Given to Quintus a Bishop in Mauritania, Who Has Asked
Advice Concerning the Baptism of Heretics.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Quintus his brother, greeting. Lucian, our co-presbyter, has reported to
me, dearest brother, that you have wished me to declare to you what I think concerning
those who seem to have been baptized by heretics and schismatics; of which matter, that
you may know what several of us fellow-bishops, with the brother presbyters who were
present, lately determined in council, I have sent you a copy of the same epistle. For I know
not by what presumption some of our colleagues2829 are led to think that they who have
been dipped by heretics ought not to be baptized when they come to us, for the reason that
they say that there is one baptism which indeed is therefore one, because the Church is one,
and there cannot be any baptism out of the Church.2830 For since there cannot be two
baptisms, if heretics truly baptize, they themselves have this baptism. And he who of his
own authority grants this advantage to them yields and consents to them, that the enemy
and adversary of Christ should seem to have the power of washing, and purifying, and
sanctifying a man. But we say that those who come thence are not re-baptized among us,
but are baptized. For indeed they do not receive anything there, where there is nothing; but
they come to us, that here they may receive where there is both grace and all truth, because
both grace and truth are one. But again some of our colleagues2831 would rather give honour
to heretics than agree with us; and while by the assertion of one baptism they are unwilling
to baptize those that come, they thus either themselves make two baptisms in saying that
there is a baptism among heretics; or certainly, which is a matter of more importance, they
strive to set before and prefer the sordid and profane washing of heretics to the true and
only and legitimate baptism of the Catholic Church, not considering that it is written, “He

made alive by him who himself is not alive, since there is one Church which, having attained
the grace of eternal life, both lives for ever and quickens the people of God.</p>
<p>2. And they say that in this matter they follow ancient custom;2833 although among the
ancients these were as yet the first beginnings of heresy and schisms, so that those were involved
in them who departed from the Church, having first been baptized therein; and these,
therefore, when they returned to the Church and repented, it was not necessary to baptize.
Which also we observe in the present day, that it is sufficient to lay hands for repentance
upon those who are known to have been baptized in the Church, and have gone over from
us to the heretics, if, subsequently acknowledging their sin and putting away their error,
they return to the truth and to their parent; so that, because it had been a sheep, the Shepherd
may receive into His fold the estranged and vagrant sheep. But if he who comes from the
heretics has not previously been baptized in the Church, but comes as a stranger and entirely
profane, he must be baptized, that he may become a sheep, because in the holy Church is
the one water which makes sheep. And therefore, because there can be nothing common
to falsehood and truth, to darkness and light, to death and immortality, to Antichrist and
Christ, we ought by all means to maintain the unity of the Catholic Church, and not to give
way to the enemies of faith and truth in any respect.</p>
<p>3. Neither must we prescribe this from custom, but overcome opposite custom by reason.
For neither did Peter, whom first the Lord chose, and upon whom He built His Church,
when Paul disputed with him afterwards about circumcision, claim anything to himself insolently,
nor arrogantly assume anything; so as to say that he held the primacy,2834 and that
he ought rather to be obeyed by novices and those lately come.2835 Nor did he despise Paul
because he had previously been a persecutor of the Church, but admitted the counsel of
truth, and easily yielded to the lawful reason which Paul asserted, furnishing thus an illustration
to us both of concord and of patience, that we should not obstinately love our own
opinions, but should rather adopt as our own those which at any time are usefully and
wholesomely suggested by our brethren and colleagues, if they be true and lawful. Paul,
moreover, looking forward to this, and consulting faithfully for concord and peace, has laid
down in his epistle this rule: “Moreover, let the prophets speak two or three, and let the rest
judge. But if anything be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.”2836
In which place he has taught and shown that many things are revealed to individuals for

the better, and that each one ought not obstinately to contend for that which he had once
imbibed and held; but if anything has appeared better and more useful, he should gladly
embrace it. For we are not overcome when better things are presented to us, but we are instructed,
especially in those matters which pertain to the unity of the Church and the truth
of our hope and faith; so that we, priests of God and prelates of His Church, by His condescension,
should know that remission of sins cannot be given save in the Church, nor can
the adversaries of Christ claim to themselves anything belonging to His grace.</p>
<p>4. Which thing, indeed, Agrippinus also, a man of worthy memory, with his other fellowbishops,
who at that time governed the Lord’s Church in the province of Africa and Numidia,
decreed, and by the well-weighed examination of the common council established: whose
opinion, as being both religious and lawful and salutary, and in harmony with the Catholic
faith and Church, we also have followed.2837 And that you may know what kind of letters

<p>To Stephen, Concerning a Council.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian with His Colleagues in a Certain Council Tells Stephen, the
Roman Bishop, that It Had Been Decreed by Them, Both that Those Who Returned
from Heresy into the Church Should Be Baptized, and that Bishops or
Priests Coming from the Heretics Should Be Received on No Other Condition,
Than that They Should Communicate as Lay People. a.d. 255.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian and others, to Stephen their brother, greeting. We have thought it necessary
for the arranging of certain matters, dearest brother, and for their investigation by the examination
of a common council, to gather together and to hold a council, at which many
priests were assembled at once; at which, moreover, many things were brought forward and
transacted. But the subject in regard to which we had chiefly to write to you, and to confer
with your gravity and wisdom, is one that more especially pertains both to the priestly authority
and to the unity, as well as the dignity, of the Catholic Church, arising as these do
from the ordination of the divine appointment; to wit, that those who have been dipped
abroad outside the Church, and have been stained among heretics and schismatics with the
taint of profane water, when they come to us and to the Church which is one, ought to be
baptized, for the reason that it is a small matter2839 to “lay hands on them that they may
receive the Holy Ghost,” unless they receive also the baptism of the Church. For then finally
can they be fully sanctified, and be the sons of God, if they be born of each sacrament;2840
since it is written, “Except a man be born again of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter
into the kingdom of God.”2841 For we find also, in the Acts of the Apostles, that this is
maintained by the apostles, and kept in the truth of the saving faith, so that when, in the
house of Cornelius the centurion, the Holy Ghost had descended upon the Gentiles who
were there, fervent in the warmth of their faith, and believing in the Lord with their whole
heart; and when, filled with the Spirit, they blessed God in divers tongues, still none the less

the blessed Apostle Peter, mindful of the divine precept and the Gospel, commanded that
those same men should be baptized who had already been filled with the Holy Spirit, that
nothing might seem to be neglected to the observance by the apostolic instruction in all
things of the law of the divine precept and Gospel.2842 But that that is not baptism which
the heretics use; and that none of those who oppose Christ can profit by the grace of Christ;
has lately been set forth with care in the letter which was written on that subject to Quintus,
our colleague, established in Mauritania; as also in a letter which our colleagues previously
wrote to our fellow-bishops presiding in Numidia, of both which letters I have subjoined
copies.</p>
<p>2. We add, however, and connect with what we have said, dearest brother, with common
consent and authority, that if, again, any presbyters or deacons, who either have been before
ordained in the Catholic Church, and have subsequently stood forth as traitors and rebels
against the Church, or who have been promoted among the heretics by a profane ordination
by the hands of false bishops and antichrists contrary to the appointment of Christ, and
have attempted to offer, in opposition to the one and divine altar, false and sacrilegious
sacrifices without, that these also be received when they return, on this condition, that they
communicate as laymen, and hold it to be enough that they should be received to peace,
after having stood forth as enemies of peace; and that they ought not, on returning, to retain
those arms of ordination and honour with which they rebelled against us. For it behoves
priests and ministers, who wait upon the altar and sacrifices, to be sound and stainless; since
the Lord God speaks in Leviticus, and says, “No man that hath a stain or a blemish shall
come nigh to offer gifts to the Lord.”2843 Moreover, in Exodus, He prescribes this same
thing, and says, “And let the priests which come near to the Lord God sanctify themselves,
lest the Lord forsake them.”2844 And again: “And when they come near to minister at the
altar of the holy place, they shall not bear iniquity upon them, lest they die.”2845 But what
can be greater iniquity, or what stain can be more odious, than to have stood in opposition
to Christ; than to have scattered His Church, which He purchased and founded with His
blood; than, unmindful of evangelical peace and love, to have fought with the madness of
hostile discord against the unanimous and accordant people of God? Such as these, although
they themselves return to the Church, still cannot restore and recall with them those who,
seduced by them, and forestalled by death without, have perished outside the Church without

of those who have stood forth as the authors and leaders of their ruin. And therefore to
such, when they return, it is sufficient that pardon should be granted; since perfidy ought
certainly not to receive promotion in the household of faith. For what do we reserve for the
good and innocent, and those who do not depart from the Church, if we honour those who
have departed from us, and stood in opposition to the Church?</p>

our mutual honour and sincere affection; believing that, according to the truth of your religion
and faith, those things which are no less religious than true will be approved by you.
But we know that some will not lay aside what they have once imbibed, and do not easily
change their purpose; but, keeping fast the bond of peace and concord among their colleagues,
retain certain things peculiar to themselves, which have once been adopted among them.
In which behalf we neither do violence to, nor impose a law upon, any one, since each prelate
has in the administration of the Church the exercise of his will free, as he shall give an account
of his conduct to the Lord.2846 We bid you, dearest brother, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Epistle LXXII.2847</head>
<p>To Jubaianus, Concerning the Baptism of Heretics.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Refutes a Letter Enclosed to Him by Jubaianus, and with the
Greatest Care Collects Whatever He Thinks Will Avail for the Defence of His
Cause. Moreover, He Sends Jubaianus a Copy of the Letter to the Numidians
and to Quintus, and Probably the Decrees of the Last Synod.2848</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Jubaianus his brother, greeting. You have written to me, dearest brother,
wishing that the impression of my mind should be signified to you, as to what I think concerning
the baptism of heretics; who, placed without, and established outside the Church,
arrogate to themselves a matter neither within their right nor their power. This baptism we
cannot consider as valid or legitimate, since it is manifestly unlawful among them; and since
we have already expressed in our letters what we thought on this matter, I have, as a compendious
method, sent you a copy of the same letters, what we decided in council when very
many of us were present, and what, moreover, I subsequently wrote back to Quintus, our
colleague, when he asked about the same thing. And now also, when we had met together,
bishops as well of the province of Africa as of Numidia, to the number of seventy-one, we
established this same matter once more2849 by our judgment, deciding that there is one
baptism which is appointed in the Catholic Church; and that by this those are not re-baptized,
but baptized by us, who at any time come from the adulterous and unhallowed water to be
washed and sanctified by the truth of the saving water.</p>
<p>2. Nor does what you have described in your letters disturb us, dearest brother, that the
Novatians re-baptize those whom they entice from us, since it does not in any wise matter
to us what the enemies of the Church do, so long as we ourselves hold a regard for our
power, and the stedfastness of reason and truth. For Novatian, after the manner of
apes—which, although they are not men, yet imitate human doings—wishes to claim to
himself the authority and truth of the Catholic Church, while he himself is not in the Church;
nay, moreover, has stood forth hitherto as a rebel and enemy against the Church. For,
knowing that there is one baptism, he arrogates to himself this one, so that he may say that
the Church is with him, and make us heretics. But we who hold the head and root2850 of

<note type="footnote">2848 In the year of Christ 256, a little after the seventh council of Carthage, Cyprian wrote a long letter to the
Bishop Jubaianus. He had consulted Cyprian about baptism, and at the same time had sent a letter not written

<note type="footnote">2849 [Letter lxx. sec. 4, p. 378, supra. Jubaian. was of Mauritania.]</note>

the one Church know, and trust for certain, that nothing is lawful there outside the Church,
and that the baptism which is one2851 is among us, where he himself also was formerly
baptized, when he maintained both the wisdom and truth of the divine unity. But if Novatian
thinks that those who have been baptized in the Church are to be re-baptized outside—
without the Church—he ought to begin by himself, that he might first be re-baptized
with an extraneous and heretical baptism, since he thinks that after the Church, yea, and
contrary to the Church, people are to be baptized without. But what sort of a thing is this,
that, because Novatian dares to do this thing, we are to think that we must not do it! What
then? Because Novatian also usurps the honour of the priestly throne, ought we therefore
to renounce our throne? Or because Novatian endeavours wrongfully to set up an altar and
to offer sacrifices, does it behove us to cease from our altar and sacrifices, lest we should
appear to be celebrating the same or like things with him? Utterly vain and foolish is it, that
because Novatian arrogates to himself outside the Church the image of the truth, we should
forsake the truth of the Church.</p>
<p>3. But among us it is no new or sudden thing for us to judge that those are to be baptized
who come to the Church from among the heretics, since it is now many years and a long
time ago, that, under Agrippinus—a man of worthy memory—very many bishops assembling
together have decided this;2852 and thenceforward until the present day, so many thousands
of heretics in our provinces have been converted to the Church, and have neither despised
nor delayed, nay, they have both reasonably and gladly embraced, the opportunity to attain
the grace of the life-giving laver and of saving baptism. For it is not difficult for a teacher
to insinuate true and lawful things into his mind, who, having condemned heretical pravity,
and discovered the truth of the Church, comes for this purpose, that he may learn, and
learns for the purpose that he may live. We ought not to increase the stolidity of heretics by
the patronage of our consent, when they gladly and readily obey the truth.</p>
<p>4. Certainly, since I found in the letter the copy of which you transmitted to me, that it
was written, “That it should not be asked who baptized, since he who is baptized might receive
remission of sins according to what he believed,” I thought that this topic was not to be
passed by, especially since I observed in the same epistle that mention was also made of
Marcion, saying that “even those that came from him did not need to be baptized, because
they seemed to have been already baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.” Therefore we ought
to consider their faith who believe without, whether in respect of the same faith they can
obtain any grace. For if we and heretics have one faith, we may also have one grace. If the
Patripassians, Anthropians, Valentinians, Apelletians, Ophites, Marcionites, and other pests,

<pb n="916"/>
and swords, and poisons of heretics for subverting the truth,2853 confess the same Father,
the same Son, the same Holy Ghost, the same Church with us, they may also have one
baptism if they have also one faith.</p>
<p>5. And lest it should be wearisome to go through all the heresies, and to enumerate
either the follies or the madness of each of them, because it is no pleasure to speak of that
which one either dreads or is ashamed to know, let us examine in the meantime about
Marcion alone, the mention of whom has been made in the letter transmitted by you to us,
whether the ground of his baptism can be made good. For the Lord after His resurrection,
sending His disciples, instructed and taught them in what manner they ought to baptize,
saying, “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye, therefore, and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”2854
He suggests the Trinity, in whose sacrament the nations were to be baptized. Does Marcion
then maintain the Trinity? Does he then assert the same Father, the Creator, as we do? Does
he know the same Son, Christ born of the Virgin Mary, who as the Word was made flesh,
who bare our sins, who conquered death by dying, who by Himself first of all originated the
resurrection of the flesh, and showed to His disciples that He had risen in the same flesh?
Widely different is the faith with Marcion, and, moreover, with the other heretics; nay, with
them there is nothing but perfidy, and blasphemy, and contention, which is hostile to holiness
and truth. How then can one who is baptized among them seem to have obtained remission
of sins, and the grace of the divine mercy, by his faith, when he has not the truth of the faith
itself? For if, as some suppose, one could receive anything abroad out of the Church according
to his faith, certainly he has received what he believed; but if he believes what is false, he
could not receive what is true; but rather he has received things adulterous and profane,
according to what he believed.</p>
<p>6. This matter of profane and adulterous baptism Jeremiah the prophet plainly rebukes,
saying, “Why do they who afflict me prevail? My wound is hard; whence shall I be healed?
while it has indeed become unto me as deceitful water which has no faithfulness.”2855 The
Holy Spirit makes mention by the prophet of deceitful water which has no faithfulness.
What is this deceitful and faithless water? Certainly that which falsely assumes the resemblance
of baptism, and frustrates the grace of faith by a shadowy pretence. But if, according
to a perverted faith, one could be baptized without, and obtain remission of sins, according
to the same faith he could also attain the Holy Spirit; and there is no need that hands should
be laid on him when he comes, that he might obtain the Holy Ghost, and be sealed. Either
<note type="footnote">2853 Or otherwise, “and other plagues of heretics subverting the truth with their swords and poisons.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2854 Matt. xxviii. 18, 19. [Elucidation XVII.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2855 Jer. xv. 18 (LXX.).</note>

<pb n="917"/>
he could obtain both privileges without by his faith, or he who has been without has received
neither.</p>
<p>7. But it is manifest where and by whom remission of sins can be given; to wit, that
which is given in baptism. For first of all the Lord gave that power to Peter, upon whom He
built the Church, and whence He appointed and showed the source of unity—the power,
namely, that whatsoever he loosed on earth should be loosed in heaven. And after the resurrection,
also, He speaks to the apostles, saying, “As the Father hath sent me, even so I send
you. And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and saith, unto them, Receive ye
the Holy Ghost: whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever
sins ye retain, they are retained.”2856 Whence we perceive that only they who are set over
the Church and established in the Gospel law, and in the ordinance of the Lord, are allowed
to baptize and to give remission of sins; but that without, nothing can either be bound or
loosed, where there is none who can either bind or loose anything.</p>
<p>8. Nor do we propose this, dearest brother, without the authority of divine Scripture,
when we say that all things are arranged by divine direction by a certain law and by special
ordinance, and that none can usurp to himself, in opposition to the bishops and priests,
anything which is not of his own right and power. For Korah, Dathan, and Abiram endeavoured
to usurp, in opposition to Moses and Aaron the priest, the power of sacrificing; and
they did not do without punishment what they unlawfully dared. The sons of Aaron also,
who placed strange fire upon the altar, were at once consumed in the sight of an angry Lord;
which punishment remains to those who introduce strange water by a false baptism, that
the divine vengeance may avenge and chastise when heretics do that in opposition to the
Church, which the Church alone is allowed to do.</p>
<p>9. But in respect of the assertion of some concerning those who had been baptized in
Samaria, that when the Apostles Peter and John came, only hands were imposed on them,
that they might receive the Holy Ghost, yet that they were not re-baptized; we see that that
place does not, dearest brother, touch the present case. For they who had believed in Samaria
had believed with a true faith; and within, in the Church which is one, and to which alone
it is granted to bestow the grace of baptism and to remit sins, had been baptized by Philip
the deacon, whom the same apostles had sent. And therefore, because they had obtained a
legitimate and ecclesiastical baptism, there was no need that they should be baptized any
more, but only that which was needed was performed by Peter and John; viz., that prayer
being made for them, and hands being imposed, the Holy Spirit should be invoked and
poured out upon them, which now too is done among us, so that they who are baptized in
the Church are brought to the prelates of the Church, and by our prayers and by the imposition
of hands obtain the Holy Spirit, and are perfected with the Lord’s seal.</p>
<note type="footnote">2856 John xx. 21–23. [See notes of Oxf. edition on this letter.]</note>

<pb n="918"/>
<p>10. There is no ground, therefore, dearest brother, for thinking that we should give way
to heretics so far as to contemplate the betrayal to them of that baptism, which is only
granted to the one and only Church. It is a good soldier’s duty to defend the camp of his
general against rebels and enemies. It is the duty of an illustrious leader to keep the standards
entrusted to him.2857 It is written, “The Lord thy God is a jealous God.”2858 We who have
received the Spirit of God ought to have a jealousy for the divine faith; with such a jealousy
as that wherewith Phineas both pleased God and justly allayed His wrath when He was
angry, and the people were perishing. Why do we receive as allowed an adulterous and alien
church, a foe to the divine unity, when we know only one Christ and His one Church? The
Church, setting forth the likeness of paradise, includes within her walls fruit-bearing trees,
whereof that which does not bring forth good fruit is cut off and is cast into the fire. These
trees she waters with four rivers, that is, with the four Gospels, wherewith, by a celestial inundation,
she bestows the grace of saving baptism. Can any one water from the Church’s
fountains who is not within the Church? Can one impart those wholesome and saving
draughts of paradise to any one if he is perverted, and of himself condemned, and banished
outside the fountains of paradise, and has dried up and failed with the dryness of an eternal
thirst?</p>
<p>11. The Lord cries aloud, that “whosoever thirsts should come and drink of the rivers
of living water that flowed out of His bosom.”2859 Whither is he to come who thirsts? Shall
he come to the heretics, where there is no fountain and river of living water at all; or to the
Church which is one, and is founded upon one who has received the keys of it by the Lord’s
voice? It is she who holds and possesses alone all the power of her spouse and Lord. In her
we preside; for her honour and unity we fight; her grace, as well as her glory, we defend with
faithful devotedness.2860 We by the divine permission water the thirsting people of God;
we guard the boundaries of the living fountains. If, therefore, we hold the right of our possession,
if we acknowledge the sacrament of unity, wherefore are we esteemed prevaricators
against truth? Wherefore are we judged betrayers of unity? The faithful, and saving, and
holy water of the Church cannot be corrupted and adulterated, as the Church herself also
is uncorrupted, and chaste, and modest. If heretics are devoted to the Church and established
in the Church, they may use both her baptism and her other saving benefits. But if they are
not in the Church, nay more, if they act against the Church, how can they baptize with the
Church’s baptism?</p>

<p>12. For it is no small and insignificant matter, which is conceded to heretics, when their
baptism is recognised by us; since thence springs the whole origin of faith and the saving
access to the hope of life eternal, and the divine condescension for purifying and quickening
the servants of God. For if any one could be baptized among heretics, certainly he could
also obtain remission of sins. If he attained remission of sins, he was also sanctified. If he
was sanctified, he also was made the temple of God. I ask, of what God? If of the Creator;
he could not be, because he has not believed in Him. If of Christ; he could not become His
temple, since he denies that Christ is God. If of the Holy Spirit; since the three are one, how
can the Holy Spirit be at peace with him who is the enemy either of the Son or of the Father?</p>
<p>13. Hence it is in vain that some who are overcome by reason oppose to us custom, as
if custom were greater than truth;2861 or as if that were not to be sought after in spiritual
matters which has been revealed as the better by the Holy Spirit. For one who errs by simplicity
may be pardoned, as the blessed Apostle Paul says of himself, “I who at first was a
blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; yet obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly.”
2862 But after inspiration and revelation made to him, he who intelligently and
knowingly perseveres in that course in which he had erred, sins without pardon for his ignorance.
For he resists with a certain presumption and obstinacy, when he is overcome by
reason. Nor let any one say, “We follow that which we have received from the apostles,”
when the apostles only delivered one Church, and one baptism, which is not ordained except
in the same Church. And we cannot find that any one, when he had been baptized by heretics,
was received by the apostles in the same baptism, and communicated in such a way as that
the apostles should appear to have approved the baptism of heretics.</p>
<p>14. For as to what some say, as if it tended to favour heretics, that the Apostle Paul declared,
“Only every way, whether in pretence or in truth, let Christ be preached,”2863 we
find that this also can avail nothing to their benefit who support and applaud heretics. For
Paul, in his epistle, was not speaking of heretics, nor of their baptism, so that anything can
be shown to have been alleged which pertained to this matter. He was speaking of brethren,
whether as walking disorderly and against the discipline of the Church, or as keeping the
truth of the Gospel with the fear of God. And he said that certain of them spoke the word
of God with constancy and courage, but some acted in envy and dissension; that some
maintained towards him a benevolent love, but that some indulged a malevolent spirit of
dissension; but yet that he bore all patiently, so long only as, whether in truth or in pretence,
the name of Christ which Paul preached might come to the knowledge of many; and the

sowing of the word, which as yet had been new and irregular, might increase through the
preaching of the speakers. Besides, it is one thing for those who are within the Church to
speak concerning the name of Christ; it is another for those who are without, and act in
opposition to the Church, to baptize in the name of Christ. Wherefore, let not those who
favour heretics put forward what Paul spoke concerning brethren, but let them show if he
thought anything was to be conceded to the heretic, or if he approved of their faith or baptism,
or if he appointed that perfidious and blasphemous men could receive remission of their
sins outside the Church.</p>
<p>15. But if we consider what the apostles thought about heretics, we shall find that they,
in all their epistles, execrated and detested the sacrilegious wickedness of heretics. For when
they say that “their word creeps as a canker,”2864 how is such a word as that able to give remission
of sins, which creeps like a canker to the ears of the hearers? And when they say
that there can be no fellowship between righteousness and unrighteousness, no communion
between light and darkness,2865 how can either darkness illuminate, or unrighteousness
justify? And when they say that “they are not of God, but are of the spirit of Antichrist,”2866
how can they transact spiritual and divine matters, who are the enemies of God, and whose
hearts the spirit of Antichrist has possessed? Wherefore, if, laying aside the errors of human
dispute, we return with a sincere and religious faith to the evangelical authority and to the
apostolical tradition, we shall perceive that they may do nothing towards conferring the
ecclesiastical and saving grace, who, scattering and attacking the Church of Christ, are called
adversaries by Christ Himself, but by His apostles, Antichrists.</p>
<p>16. Again, there is no ground for any one, for the circumvention of Christian truth,
opposing to us the name of Christ, and saying, “All who are baptized everywhere, and in
any manner, in the name of Jesus Christ, have obtained the grace of baptism,”—when Christ
Himself speaks, and says, “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven.”2867 And again, He forewarns and instructs, that no one should be
easily deceived by false prophets and false Christs in His name. “Many,” He says, “shall
come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.” And afterwards He added:
“But take ye heed; behold, I have foretold you all things.”2868 Whence it appears that all
things are not at once to be received and assumed which are boasted of in the name of Christ,
but only those things which are done in the truth of Christ.</p>

<p>17. For whereas in the Gospels, and in the epistles of the apostles, the name of Christ is
alleged for the remission of sins; it is not in such a way as that the Son alone, without the
Father, or against the Father, can be of advantage to anybody; but that it might be shown
to the Jews, who boasted as to their having the Father, that the Father would profit them
nothing, unless they believed on the Son whom He had sent. For they who know God the
Father the Creator, ought also to know Christ the Son, lest they should flatter and applaud
themselves about the Father alone, without the acknowledgment of His Son, who also said,
“No man cometh to the Father but by me.”2869 But He, the same, sets forth, that it is the
knowledge of the two which saves, when He says, “And this is life eternal, that they might
know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”2870 Since, therefore,
from the preaching and testimony of Christ Himself, the Father who sent must be first
known, then afterwards Christ, who was sent, and there cannot be a hope of salvation except
by knowing the two together; how, when God the Father is not known, nay, is even blasphemed,
can they who among the heretics are said to be baptized in the name of Christ, be
judged to have obtained the remission of sins? For the case of the Jews under the apostles
was one, but the condition of the Gentiles is another. The former, because they had already
gained the most ancient baptism of the law and Moses, were to be baptized also in the name
of Jesus Christ, in conformity with what Peter tells them in the Acts of the Apostles, saying,
“Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the remission
of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For this promise is unto you,
and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall
call.”2871 Peter makes mention of Jesus Christ, not as though the Father should be omitted,
but that the Son also might be joined to the Father.</p>
<p>18. Finally, when, after the resurrection, the apostles are sent by the Lord to the heathens,
they are bidden to baptize the Gentiles “in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost.” How, then, do some say, that a Gentile baptized without, outside the
Church, yea, and in opposition to the Church, so that it be only in the name of Jesus Christ,
everywhere, and in whatever manner, can obtain remission of sin, when Christ Himself
commands the heathen to be baptized in the full and united Trinity? Unless while one who
denies Christ is denied by Christ, he who denies His Father whom Christ Himself confessed
is not denied; and he who blasphemes against Him whom Christ called His Lord and His
God, is rewarded by Christ, and obtains remission of sins, and the sanctification of baptism!
But by what power can he who denies God the Creator, the Father of Christ, obtain, in
baptism, the remission of sins, since Christ received that very power by which we are baptized

<note type="footnote">2871 Acts ii. 38, 39.</note>

<pb n="922"/>
and sanctified, from the same Father, whom He called “greater” than Himself, by whom He
desired to be glorified, whose will He fulfilled even unto the obedience of drinking the cup,
and of undergoing death? What else is it then, than to become a partaker with blaspheming
heretics, to wish to maintain and assert, that one who blasphemes and gravely sins against
the Father and the Lord and God of Christ, can receive remission of sins in the name of
Christ? What, moreover, is that, and of what kind is it, that he who denies the Son of God
has not the Father, and he who denies the Father should be thought to have the Son, although
the Son Himself testifies, and says, “No man can come unto me except it were given unto
him of my Father?”2872 So that it is evident, that no remission of sins can be received in
baptism from the Son, which it is not plain that the Father has granted. Especially, since He
further repeats, and says, “Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be
rooted up.”2873</p>
<p>19. But if Christ’s disciples are unwilling to learn from Christ what veneration and
honour is due to the name of the Father, still let them learn from earthly and secular examples,
and know that Christ has declared, not without the strongest rebuke, “The children of this
world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.”2874 In this world of ours, if
any one have offered an insult to the father of any; if in injury and frowardness he have
wounded his reputation and his honour by a malevolent tongue, the son is indignant, and
wrathful, and with what means he can, strives to avenge his injured father’s wrong. Think
you that Christ grants impunity to the impious and profane, and the blasphemers of His
Father, and that He puts away their sins in baptism, who it is evident, when baptized, still
heap up evil words on the person of the Father, and sin with the unceasing wickedness of a
blaspheming tongue? Can a Christian, can a servant of God, either conceive this in his mind,
or believe it in faith, or put it forward in discourse? And what will become of the precepts
of the divine law, which say, “Honour thy father and thy mother?”2875 If the name of father,
which in man is commanded to be honoured, is violated with impunity in God, what will
become of what Christ Himself lays down in the Gospel, and says, “He that curseth father
or mother, let him die the death;”2876 if He who bids that those who curse their parents after
the flesh should be punished and slain, Himself quickens those who revile their heavenly
and spiritual Father, and are hostile to the Church, their Mother? An execrable and detestable
thing is actually asserted by some, that He who threatens the man who blasphemes against
the Holy Spirit, that he shall be guilty of eternal sin, Himself condescends to sanctify those

who blaspheme against God the Father with saving baptism. And now, those who think
that they must communicate with such as come to the Church without baptism, do not
consider that they are becoming partakers with other men’s, yea, with eternal sins, when
they admit without baptism those who cannot, except in baptism, put off the sins of their
blasphemies.</p>
<p>20. Besides, how vain and perverse a thing it is, that when the heretics themselves, having
repudiated and forsaken either the error or the wickedness in which they had previously
been, acknowledge the truth of the Church, we should mutilate the rights and sacrament of
that same truth, and say to those who come to us and repent, that they had obtained remission
of sins when they confess that they have sinned, and are for that reason come to seek the
pardon of the Church! Wherefore, dearest brother, we ought both firmly to maintain the
faith and truth of the Catholic Church, and to teach, and by all the evangelical and apostolical
precepts to set forth, the plan of the divine dispensation and unity.</p>
<p>21. Can the power of baptism be greater or of more avail than confession, than suffering,
when one confesses Christ before men and is baptized in his own blood? And yet even this
baptism does not benefit a heretic, although he has confessed Christ, and been put to death
outside the Church, unless the patrons and advocates of heretics declare that the heretics
who are slain in a false confession of Christ are martyrs, and assign to them the glory and
the crown of martyrdom contrary to the testimony of the apostle, who says that it will profit
them nothing although they were burnt and slain.2877 But if not even the baptism of a
public confession and blood can profit a heretic to salvation, because there is no salvation
out of the Church,2878 how much less shall it be of advantage to him, if in a hiding-place
and a cave of robbers, stained with the contagion of adulterous water, he has not only not
put off his old sins, but rather heaped up still newer and greater ones! Wherefore baptism
cannot be common to us and to heretics, to whom neither God the Father, nor Christ the
Son, nor the Holy Ghost, nor the faith, nor the Church itself, is common. And therefore it
behoves those to be baptized who come from heresy to the Church, that so they who are
prepared, in the lawful, and true, and only baptism of the holy Church, by divine regeneration,
for the kingdom of God, may be born of both sacraments, because it is written, “Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”2879</p>
<p>22. On which place some, as if by human reasoning they were able to make void the
truth of the Gospel declaration, object to us the case of catechumens; asking if any one of

<pb n="924"/>
these, before he is baptized in the Church, should be apprehended and slain on confession
of the name, whether he would lose the hope of salvation and the reward of confession, because
he had not previously been born again of water? Let men of this kind, who are aiders
and favourers of heretics, know therefore, first, that those catechumens hold the sound faith
and truth of the Church, and advance from the divine camp to do battle with the devil, with
a full and sincere acknowledgment of God the Father, and of Christ, and of the Holy Ghost;
then, that they certainly are not deprived of the sacrament of baptism who are baptized with
the most glorious and greatest baptism of blood, concerning which the Lord also said, that
He had “another baptism to be baptized with.”2880 But the same Lord declares in the Gospel,
that those who are baptized in their own blood, and sanctified by suffering, are perfected,
and obtain the grace of the divine promise, when He speaks to the thief believing and confessing
in His very passion, and promises that he should be with Himself in paradise.
Wherefore we who are set over the faith and truth ought not to deceive and mislead those
who come to the faith and truth, and repent, and beg that their sins should be remitted to
them; but to instruct them when corrected by us, and reformed for the kingdom of heaven
by celestial discipline.</p>
<p>23. But some one says, “What, then, shall become of those who in past times, coming
from heresy to the Church, were received without baptism?” The Lord is able by His mercy
to give indulgence,2881 and not to separate from the gifts of His Church those who by simplicity
were admitted into the Church, and in the Church have fallen asleep. Nevertheless
it does not follow that, because there was error at one time, there must always be error; since
it is more fitting for wise and God-fearing men, gladly and without delay to obey the truth
when laid open and perceived, than pertinaciously and obstinately to struggle against brethren
and fellow-priests on behalf of heretics.</p>
<p>24. Nor let any one think that, because baptism is proposed to them, heretics will be
kept back from coming to the Church, as if offended at the name of a second baptism; nay,
but on this very account they are rather driven to the necessity of coming by the testimony
of truth shown and proved to them. For if they shall see that it is determined and decreed
by our judgment and sentence, that the baptism wherewith they are there baptized is considered
just and legitimate, they will think that they are justly and legitimately in possession
of the Church also, and the other gifts of the Church; nor will there be any reason for their
coming to us, when, as they have baptism, they seem also to have the rest. But further, when
they know that there is no baptism without, and that no remission of sins can be given
outside the Church, they more eagerly and readily hasten to us, and implore the gifts and

<pb n="925"/>
benefits of the Church our Mother, assured that they can in no wise attain to the true
promise of divine grace unless they first come to the truth of the Church. Nor will heretics
refuse to be baptized among us with the lawful and true baptism of the Church, when they
shall have learnt from us that they also were baptized by Paul, who already had been baptized
with the baptism of John,2882 as we read in the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
<p>25. And now by certain of us the baptism of heretics is asserted to occupy the (like)
ground, and, as if by a certain dislike of re-baptizing, it is counted unlawful to baptize after
God’s enemies. And this, although we find that they were baptized whom John had baptized:
John, esteemed the greatest among the prophets; John, filled with divine grace even in his
mother’s womb; who was sustained with the spirit and power of Elias; who was not an adversary
of the Lord, but His precursor and announcer; who not only foretold our Lord in
words, but even showed Him to the eyes; who baptized Christ Himself by whom others are
baptized. But if on that account a heretic could obtain the right of baptism, because he first
baptized, then baptism will not belong to the person that has it, but to the person that seizes
it. And since baptism and the Church can by no means be separated from one another, and
divided, he who has first been able to lay hold on baptism has equally also laid hold on the
Church; and you begin to appear to him as a heretic, when you being anticipated, have begun
to be last, and by yielding and giving way have relinquished the right which you had received.
But how dangerous it is in divine matters, that any one should depart from his right and
power, Holy Scripture declares when, in Genesis, Esau thence lost his birthright, nor was
able afterwards to regain that which he had once given up.</p>
<p>26. These things, dearest brother, I have briefly written to you, according to my abilities,
prescribing to none, and prejudging none, so as to prevent any one of the bishops doing
what he thinks well, and having the free exercise of his judgment.2883 We, as far as in us
lies, do not contend on behalf of heretics with our colleagues and fellow-bishops, with whom
we maintain a divine concord and the peace of the Lord;2884 especially since the apostle
says, “If any man, however, is thought to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither
the Church of God.”2885 Charity of spirit, the honour of our college, the bond of faith, and

<p>To Pompey, Against the Epistle of Stephen About the Baptism of Heretics.
Argument.—The Purport of This Epistle is Given in St. Augustine’s “Contra
Donatistas,” Lib. V. Cap. 23. He Says There: “Cyprian, Moreover, Writes to
Pompey on the Same Subject, When He Plainly Signifies that Stephen, Who, as
We Learn, Was Then a Bishop of the Roman Church, Not Only Did Not Agree

<p>1. Cyprian to his brother Pompeius, greeting. Although I have fully comprised what is
to be said concerning the baptism of heretics in the letters of which I sent you copies, dearest
brother, yet, since you have desired that what Stephen our brother replied to my letters
should be brought to your knowledge, I have sent you a copy of his reply; on the reading of
which, you will more and more observe his error in endeavouring to maintain the cause of
heretics against Christians, and against the Church of God.2889 For among other matters,
which were either haughtily assumed, or were not pertaining to the matter, or contradictory
to his own view, which he unskilfully and without foresight wrote, he moreover added this
saying: “If any one, therefore, come to you from any heresy whatever, let nothing be innovated

<note type="footnote">2888 On which subject, again, in chap. 25: “I will not now reconsider what he angrily uttered against Stephen,
because there is no necessity for it. The very same things are indeed said which have already been sufficiently
discussed, and it is better to pass by what suggested the risk of a mischievous dissension. Stephen, for his part,
had thought that they who endeavoured to annul the old custom about receiving heretics were to be excommunicated;
but the other, moved with the difficulty of that very question, and very largely endowed with a sacred
charity, thought that unity might be maintained with them who thought differently. Thus, although there was
a great deal of keenness, yet it was always in a spirit of brotherhood; and at length the peace of Christ conquered
in their hearts, so that in such a dispute none of the mischief of schism arose between them” (Migne). [Ed. Migne
adds, assuming the mediæval system to have been known to Cyprian, as follows]: “Thus far Augustine, whom
we have quoted at length, because the passage is opposed to those who strive from this to assert his schism from

pentance;2890 since the heretics themselves, in their own proper character, do not baptize
such as come to them from one another, but only admit them to communion.”</p>
<p>2. He forbade one coming from any heresy to be baptized in the Church; that is, he
judged the baptism of all heretics to be just and lawful. And although special heresies have
special baptisms and different sins, he, holding communion with the baptism of all, gathered
up the sins of all, heaped together into his own bosom. And he charged that nothing should
be innovated except what had been handed down; as if he were an innovator, who, holding
the unity, claims for the one Church one baptism; and not manifestly he who, forgetful of
unity, adopts the lies and the contagions of a profane washing. Let nothing be innovated,
says he, nothing maintained, except what has been handed down. Whence is that tradition?
Whether does it descend from the authority of the Lord and of the Gospel, or does it come
from the commands and the epistles of the apostles? For that those things which are written
must be done, God witnesses and admonishes, saying to Joshua the son of Nun: “The book
of this law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night,
that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein.”2891 Also the Lord,
sending His apostles, commands that the nations should be baptized, and taught to observe
all things which He commanded. If, therefore, it is either prescribed in the Gospel, or contained
in the epistles or Acts of the Apostles, that those who come from any heresy should
not be baptized, but only hands laid upon them to repentance, let this divine and holy tradition
be observed. But if everywhere heretics are called nothing else than adversaries and
antichrists, if they are pronounced to be people to be avoided, and to be perverted and
condemned of their own selves, wherefore is it that they should not be thought worthy of
being condemned by us, since it is evident from the apostolic testimony2892 that they are
of their own selves condemned? So that no one ought to defame the apostles as if they had
approved of the baptisms of heretics, or had communicated with them without the Church’s
baptism, when they, the apostles, wrote such things of the heretics. And this, too, while as
yet the more terrible plagues of heresy had not broken forth; while Marcion of Pontus had
not yet emerged from Pontus, whose master Cerdon came to Rome,—while Hyginus was
still bishop, who was the ninth bishop in that city,—whom Marcion followed, and with
greater impudence adding other enhancements to his crime, and more daringly set himself
to blaspheme against God the Father, the Creator, and armed with sacrilegious arms the
heretical madness that rebelled against the Church with greater wickedness and determination.</p>
<note type="footnote">2890 Meaning, probably, heretics with regard to the doctrine of the Trinity, Stephen not regarding the

<note type="footnote">2892 [Tit. iii. 11.]</note>

<pb n="929"/>
<p>3. But if it is evident that subsequently heresies became more numerous and worse; and
if, in time past, it was never at all prescribed nor written that only hands should be laid upon
a heretic for repentance, and that so he might be communicated with; and if there is only
one baptism, which is with us, and is within, and is granted of the divine condescension to
the Church alone, what obstinacy is that, or what presumption, to prefer human tradition
to divine ordinance, and not to observe that God is indignant and angry as often as human
tradition relaxes and passes by the divine precepts, as He cries out, and says by Isaiah the
prophet, “This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But in
vain do they worship me, teaching the doctrines and commandments of men.”2893 Also the
Lord in the Gospel, similarly rebuking and reproving, utters and says, “Ye reject the commandment
of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.”2894 Mindful of which precept,
the blessed Apostle Paul himself also warns and instructs, saying, “If any man teach otherwise,
and consent not to the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to His doctrine, he
is proud, knowing nothing: from such withdraw thyself.”2895</p>
<p>4. Certainly an excellent and lawful tradition is set before us by the teaching of our
brother Stephen, which may afford us a suitable authority! For in the same place of his
epistle he has added and continued: “Since those who are specially heretics do not baptize
those who come to them from one another, but only receive them to communion.” To this
point of evil has the Church of God and spouse of Christ been developed, that she follows
the examples of heretics; that for the purpose of celebrating the celestial sacraments, light
should borrow her discipline from darkness, and Christians should do that which antichrists
do. But what is that blindness of soul, what is that degradation of faith, to refuse to recognise
the unity2896 which comes from God the Father, and from the tradition of Jesus Christ the
Lord and our God! For if the Church is not with heretics, therefore, because it is one, and
cannot be divided; and if thus the Holy Spirit is not there, because He is one, and cannot be
among profane persons, and those who are without; certainly also baptism, which consists
in the same unity, cannot be among heretics, because it can neither be separated from the
Church nor from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>5. Or if they attribute the effect of baptism to the majesty of the name, so that they who
are baptized anywhere and anyhow, in the name of Jesus Christ, are judged to be renewed
and sanctified; wherefore, in the name of the same Christ, are not hands laid upon the
baptized persons among them, for the reception of the Holy Spirit? Why does not the same

majesty of the same name avail in the imposition of hands, which, they contend, availed in
the sanctification of baptism? For if any one born out of the Church can become God’s
temple, why cannot the Holy Spirit also be poured out upon the temple? For he who has
been sanctified, his sins being put away in baptism, and has been spiritually reformed into
a new man, has become fitted for receiving the Holy Spirit; since the apostle says, “As many
of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.”2897 He who, having been
baptized among the heretics, is able to put on Christ, may much more receive the Holy
Spirit whom Christ sent. Otherwise He who is sent will be greater than Him who sends; so
that one baptized without may begin indeed to put on Christ, but not to be able to receive
the Holy Spirit, as if Christ could either be put on without the Spirit, or the Spirit be separated
from Christ. Moreover, it is silly to say, that although the second birth is spiritual, by which
we are born in Christ through the laver of regeneration, one may be born spiritually among
the heretics, where they say that the Spirit is not. For water alone is not able to cleanse away
sins, and to sanctify a man, unless he have also the Holy Spirit.2898 Wherefore it is necessary
that they should grant the Holy Spirit to be there, where they say that baptism is; or else
there is no baptism where the Holy Spirit is not, because there cannot be baptism without
the Spirit.</p>
<p>6. But what a thing it is, to assert and contend that they who are not born in the Church
can be the sons of God! For the blessed apostle sets forth and proves that baptism is that
wherein the old man dies and the new man is born, saying, “He saved us by the washing of
regeneration.”2899 But if regeneration is in the washing, that is, in baptism, how can heresy,
which is not the spouse of Christ, generate sons to God by Christ? For it is the Church alone
which, conjoined and united with Christ, spiritually bears sons; as the same apostle again
says, “Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify it, cleansing
it with the washing of water.”2900 If, then, she is the beloved and spouse who alone is sanctified
by Christ, and alone is cleansed by His washing, it is manifest that heresy, which is
not the spouse of Christ, nor can be cleansed nor sanctified by His washing, cannot bear
sons to God.2901</p>
<p>7. But further, one is not born by the imposition of hands when he receives the Holy
Ghost, but in baptism, that so, being already born, he may receive the Holy Spirit, even as

it happened in the first man Adam. For first God formed him, and then breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life. For the Spirit cannot be received, unless he who receives first have
an existence. But as the birth of Christians is in baptism, while the generation and sanctification
of baptism are with the spouse of Christ alone, who is able spiritually to conceive and
to bear sons to God, where and of whom and to whom is he born, who is not a son of the
Church, so as that he should have God as his Father, before he has had the Church for his
Mother? But as no heresy at all, and equally no schism, being without, can have the sanctification
of saving baptism, why has the bitter obstinacy of our brother Stephen broken forth
to such an extent, as to contend that sons are born to God from the baptism of Marcion;
moreover, of Valentinus and Apelles, and of others who blaspheme against God the Father;
and to say that remission of sins is granted in the name of Jesus Christ where blasphemy is
uttered against the Father and against Christ the Lord God?</p>
<p>8. In which place, dearest brother, we must consider, for the sake of the faith and the
religion of the sacerdotal office which we discharge, whether the account can be satisfactory
in the day of judgment for a priest of God, who maintains, and approves, and acquiesces in
the baptism of blasphemers, when the Lord threatens, and says, “And now, O ye priests,
this commandment is for you: if ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart to give
glory unto my name, saith the Lord Almighty, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will
curse your blessings.”2902 Does he give glory to God, who communicates with the baptism
of Marcion? Does he give glory to God, who judges that remission of sins is granted among
those who blaspheme against God? Does he give glory to God, who affirms that sons are
born to God without, of an adulterer and a harlot? Does he give glory to God, who does not
hold the unity and truth that arise from the divine law, but maintains heresies against the
Church? Does he give glory to God, who, a friend of heretics and an enemy to Christians,
thinks that the priests of God, who support the truth of Christ and the unity of the Church,
are to be excommunicated?2903 If glory is thus given to God, if the fear and the discipline
of God is thus preserved by His worshippers and His priests, let us cast away our arms; let
us give ourselves up to captivity; let us deliver to the devil the ordination of the Gospel, the
appointment of Christ, the majesty of God; let the sacraments of the divine warfare be loosed;
let the standards of the heavenly camp be betrayed; and let the Church succumb and yield
to heretics, light to darkness, faith to perfidy, hope to despair, reason to error, immortality
to death, love to hatred, truth to falsehood, Christ to Antichrist! Deservedly thus do heresies
and schisms arise day by day, more frequently and more fruitfully grow up, and with serpents’
locks shoot forth and cast out against the Church of God with greater force the poison of

their venom; whilst, by the advocacy of some, both authority and support are afforded them;
whilst their baptism is defended, whilst faith, whilst truth, is betrayed;2904 whilst that which
is done without against the Church is defended within in the very Church itself.</p>
<p>9. But if there be among us, most beloved brother, the fear of God, if the maintenance
of the faith prevail, if we keep the precepts of Christ, if we guard the incorrupt and inviolate
sanctity of His spouse, if the words of the Lord abide in our thoughts and hearts, when he
says, “Thinkest thou, when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?”2905
then, because we are God’s faithful soldiers, who war for the faith and sincere religion of
God, let us keep the camp entrusted to us by God with faithful valour. Nor ought custom,
which had crept in among some, to prevent the truth from prevailing and conquering; for
custom without truth is the antiquity of error.2906 On which account, let us forsake the error
and follow the truth, knowing that in Esdras also the truth conquers, as it is written: “Truth
endureth and grows strong to eternity, and lives and prevails for ever and ever. With her
there is no accepting of persons or distinctions; but what is just she does: nor in her judgments
is there unrighteousness, but the strength, and the kingdom, and the majesty, and the power
of all ages. Blessed be the Lord God of truth!”2907 This truth Christ showed to us in His
Gospel, and said, “I am the truth.”2908 Wherefore, if we are in Christ, and have Christ in
us, if we abide in the truth, and the truth abides in us, let us keep fast those things which
are true.</p>
<p>10. But it happens, by a love of presumption and of obstinacy, that one would rather
maintain his own evil and false position, than agree in the right and true which belongs to
another. Looking forward to which, the blessed Apostle Paul writes to Timothy, and warns
him that a bishop must not be “litigious, nor contentious, but gentle and teachable.”2909
Now he is teachable who is meek and gentle to the patience of learning. For it behoves a
bishop not only to teach, but also to learn; because he also teaches better who daily increases
and advances by learning better; which very thing, moreover, the same Apostle Paul teaches,
when he admonishes, “that if anything better be revealed to one sitting by, the first should
hold his peace.”2910 But there is a brief way for religious and simple minds, both to put away
error, and to find and to elicit truth. For if we return to the head and source of divine tradi-

tion, human error ceases; and having seen the reason of the heavenly sacraments, whatever
lay hid in obscurity under the gloom and cloud of darkness, is opened into the light of the
truth. If a channel supplying water, which formerly flowed plentifully and freely, suddenly
fail, do we not go to the fountain, that there the reason of the failure may be ascertained,
whether from the drying up of the springs the water has failed at the fountainhead, or
whether, flowing thence free and full, it has failed in the midst of its course; that so, if it has
been caused by the fault of an interrupted or leaky channel, that the constant stream does
not flow uninterruptedly and continuously, then the channel being repaired and strengthened,
the water collected may be supplied for the use and drink of the city, with the same fertility
and plenty with which it issues from the spring? And this it behoves the priests of God to
do now, if they would keep the divine precepts, that if in any respect the truth have wavered
and vacillated, we should return to our original and Lord, and to the evangelical and
apostolical tradition; and thence may arise the ground of our action, whence has taken rise
both our order and our origin.2911</p>
<p>11. For it has been delivered to us, that there is one God, and one Christ, and one hope,
and one faith, and one Church, and one baptism ordained only in the one Church, from
which unity whosoever will depart must needs be found with heretics; and while he upholds
them against the Church, he impugns the sacrament of the divine tradition. The sacrament
of which unity we see expressed also in the Canticles, in the person of Christ, who says, “A
garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse, a fountain sealed, a well of living water, a garden
with the fruit of apples.”2912 But if His Church is a garden enclosed, and a fountain sealed,
how can he who is not in the Church enter into the same garden, or drink from its fountain?
Moreover, Peter himself, showing and vindicating the unity, has commanded and warned
us that we cannot be saved, except by the one only baptism of one Church. “In the ark,” says
he, “of Noah, few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water, as also baptism shall in like
manner save you.”2913 In how short and spiritual a summary has he set forth the sacrament
of unity! For as, in that baptism of the world in which its ancient iniquity was purged away,
he who was not in the ark of Noah could not be saved by water, so neither can he appear to
be saved by baptism who has not been baptized in the Church which is established in the
unity2914 of the Lord according to the sacrament of the one ark.</p>

held by us, that all who are converted from any heresy whatever to the Church must be

<head>Epistle LXXIV.2916</head>
<p>Firmilian, Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, to Cyprian, Against the Letter of
Stephen. a.d. 256.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Argument of This Letter is Exactly the Same as that of the Previous
One, But Written with a Little More Vehemence and Acerbity Than Becomes a
Bishop,2917 Chiefly for the Reason, as May Be Suspected, that Stephen Had Also
Written Another Letter to Firmilianus, Helenus, and Other Bishops of Those
Parts.2918</p>
<p>1. Firmilianus to Cyprian, his brother in the Lord, greeting. We have received by
Rogatian, our beloved deacon, the letter sent by you which you wrote to us, well-beloved
brother; and we gave the greatest thanks to the Lord, because it has happened that we who
are separated from one another in body are thus united in spirit, as if we were not only occupying
one country, but inhabiting together one and the self-same house. Which also it is
becoming for us to say, because, indeed, the spiritual house of God is one. “For it shall come
to pass in the last days,” saith the prophet, “that the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest,
and the house of God above the tops of the mountains.”2919 Those that come together into
this house are united with gladness, according to what is asked from the Lord in the psalm,
to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of one’s life. Whence in another place also it
is made manifest, that among the saints there is great and desirous love for assembling together.
“Behold,” he says, “how good and how pleasant a thing it is for brethren to dwell
together in unity!”2920</p>
<p>2. For unity and peace and concord afford the greatest pleasure not only to men who
believe and know the truth, but also to heavenly angels themselves, to whom the divine
word says it is a joy when one sinner repents and returns to the bond of unity. But assuredly
this would not be said of the angels, who have their conversation in heaven, unless they
themselves also were united to us, who rejoice at our unity; even as, on the other hand, they

opinion concerning the baptism of heretics, as Eusebius tells us from a letter of Dionysius of Alexandria to

are assuredly saddened when they see the diverse minds and the divided wills of some, as
if not only they do not together invoke one and the same God, but as if, separated and divided
from one another, they can neither have a common conversation nor discourse.2921 Except
that we may in this matter give thanks to Stephen, that it has now happened through his
unkindness that we receive the proof of your faith and wisdom. But although we have received
the favour of this benefit on account of Stephen, certainly Stephen has not done anything
deserving of kindness and thanks. For neither can Judas be thought worthy by his perfidy
and treachery wherewith he wickedly dealt concerning the Saviour, as though he had been
the cause of such great advantages, that through him the world and the people of the Gentiles
were delivered by the Lord’s passion.</p>
<p>3. But let these things which were done by Stephen be passed by for the present, lest,
while we remember his audacity and pride, we bring a more lasting sadness on ourselves
from the things that he has wickedly done.2922 And knowing, concerning you, that you have
settled this matter, concerning which there is now a question, according to the rule of truth
and the wisdom of Christ; we have exulted with great joy, and have given God thanks that
we have found in brethren placed at such a distance such a unanimity of faith and truth
with us. For the grace of God is mighty to associate and join together in the bond of charity
and unity even those things which seem to be divided by a considerable space of earth, according
to the way in which of old also the divine power associated in the bond of unanimity
Ezekiel and Daniel, though later in their age, and separated from them by a long space of
time, to Job and Noah, who were among the first; so that although they were separated by
long periods, yet by divine inspiration they felt the same truths. And this also we now observe
in you, that you who are separated from us by the most extensive regions, approve yourselves
to be, nevertheless, joined with us in mind and spirit. All which arises from the divine unity.
For even as the Lord who dwells in us is one and the same, He everywhere joins and couples
His own people in the bond of unity, whence their sound has gone out into the whole earth,
who are sent by the Lord swiftly running in the spirit of unity; as, on the other hand, it is of
no advantage that some are very near and joined together bodily, if in spirit and mind they
differ, since souls cannot at all be united which divide themselves from God’s unity. “For,
lo,” it says, “they that are far from Thee shall perish.”2923 But such shall undergo the judgment
of God according to their desert, as depart from His words who prays to the Father for unity,
and says, “Father, grant that, as Thou and I are one, so they also may be one in us.”2924

<p>4. But we receive those things which you have written as if they were our own; nor do
we read them cursorily, but by frequent repetition have committed them to memory. Nor
does it hinder saving usefulness, either to repeat the same things for the confirmation of the
truth, or, moreover, to add some things for the sake of accumulating proof. But if anything
has been added by us, it is not added as if there had been too little said by you; but since the
divine discourse surpasses human nature, and the soul cannot conceive or grasp the whole
and perfect word, therefore also the number of prophets is so great, that the divine wisdom
in its multiplicity may be distributed through many. Whence also he who first speaks in
prophecy is bidden to be silent if a revelation be made to a second. For which reason it
happens of necessity among us, that year by year we, the elders and prelates, assemble together
to arrange those matters which are committed to our care, so that if any things are
more serious they may be directed by the common counsel. Moreover, we do this that some
remedy may be sought for by repentance for lapsed brethren, and for those wounded by the
devil after the saving laver, not as though they obtained remission of sins from us, but that
by our means they may be converted to the understanding of their sins, and may be compelled
to give fuller satisfaction to the Lord.</p>
<p>5. But since that messenger sent by you was in haste to return to you, and the winter
season was pressing, we replied what we could to your letter. And indeed, as respects what
Stephen has said, as though the apostles forbade those who come from heresy to be baptized,
and delivered this also to be observed by their successors, you have replied most abundantly,
that no one is so foolish as to believe that the apostles delivered this, when it is even well
known that these heresies themselves, execrable and detestable as they are, arose subsequently;
when even Marcion the disciple of Cerdo is found to have introduced his sacrilegious tradition
against God long after the apostles, and after long lapse of time from them. Apelles,
also consenting to his blasphemy, added many other new and more important matters
hostile to faith and truth. But also the time of Valentinus and Basilides is manifest, that they
too, after the apostles, and after a long period, rebelled against the Church of God with their
wicked lies. It is plain that the other heretics, also, afterwards introduced their evil sects and
perverse inventions, even as every one was led by error; all of whom, it is evident, were selfcondemned,
and have declared against themselves an inevitable sentence before the day of
judgment; and he who confirms the baptism of these, what else does he do but adjudge
himself with them, and condemn himself, making himself a partaker with such?</p>
<p>6. But that they who are at Rome do not observe those things in all cases which are
handed down from the beginning, and vainly pretend the authority of the apostles;2925 any
one may know also from the fact, that concerning the celebration of Easter, and concerning

<pb n="938"/>
many other sacraments of divine matters, he may see that there are some diversities among
them, and that all things are not observed among them alike, which are observed at Jerusalem,
just as in very many other provinces also many things are varied because of the difference
of the places and names.2926 And yet on this account there is no departure at all from the
peace and unity of the Catholic Church, such as Stephen has now dared to make;2927
breaking the peace against you, which his predecessors have always kept with you in mutual
love and honour, even herein defaming Peter and Paul the blessed apostles,2928 as if the
very men delivered this who in their epistles execrated heretics, and warned us to avoid
them. Whence it appears that this tradition is of men which maintains heretics, and asserts
that they have baptism, which belongs to the Church alone.</p>
<p>7. But, moreover, you have well answered that part where Stephen said in his letter that
heretics themselves also are of one mind in respect of baptism; and that they do not baptize
such as come to them from one another, but only communicate with them; as if we also
ought to do this. In which place, although you have already proved that it is sufficiently ridiculous
for any one to follow those that are in error, yet we add this moreover, over and
above, that it is not wonderful for heretics to act thus, who, although in some lesser matters
they differ, yet in that which is greatest they hold one and the same agreement to blaspheme
the Creator, figuring for themselves certain dreams and phantasms of an unknown God.
Assuredly it is but natural that these should agree in having a baptism which is unreal,2929
in the same way as they agree in repudiating the truth of the divinity. Of whom, since it is
tedious to reply to their several statements, either wicked or foolish, it is sufficient shortly
to say in sum, that they who do not hold the true Lord the Father cannot hold the truth
either of the Son or of the Holy Spirit; according to which also they who are called Cataphrygians,
and endeavour to claim to themselves new prophecies, can have neither the
Father, nor the Son, nor the Holy Spirit,2930 of whom, if we ask what Christ they announce,
they will reply that they preach Him who sent the Spirit that speaks by Montanus and Prisca.
And in these, when we observe that there has been not the spirit of truth, but of error, we
know that they who maintain their false prophesying against the faith of Christ cannot have
Christ. Moreover, all other heretics, if they have separated themselves from the Church of
God, can have nothing of power or of grace, since all power and grace are established in the

Church where the elders2931 preside, who possess the power both of baptizing, and of imposition
of hands, and of ordaining. For as a heretic may not lawfully ordain nor lay on
hands, so neither may he baptize, nor do any thing holily or spiritually, since he is an alien
from spiritual and deifying sanctity. All which we some time back confirmed in Iconium,
which is a place in Phrygia, when we were assembled together with those who had gathered
from Galatia and Cilicia, and other neighbouring countries, as to be held and firmly vindicated
against heretics, when there was some doubt in certain minds concerning that matter.2932</p>
<p>8. And as Stephen and those who agree with him contend that putting away of sins and
second birth may result from the baptism of heretics, among whom they themselves confess
that the Holy Spirit is not; let them consider and understand that spiritual birth cannot be
without the Spirit; in conformity with which also the blessed Apostle Paul baptized anew
with a spiritual baptism those who had already been baptized by John before the Holy
Spirit had been sent by the Lord, and so laid hands on them that they might receive the Holy
Ghost. But what kind of a thing is it, that when we see that Paul, after John’s baptism, baptized
his disciples again, we are hesitating to baptize those who come to the Church from heresy
after their unhallowed and profane dipping. Unless, perchance, Paul was inferior to the
bishops of these times, so that these indeed can by imposition of hands alone give the Holy
Spirit to those heretics who come (to the Church), while Paul was not fitted to give the Holy
Spirit by imposition of hands to those who had been baptized by John, unless he had first
baptized them also with the baptism of the Church.</p>
<p>9. That, moreover, is absurd, that they do not think it is to be inquired who was the
person that baptized, for the reason that he who has been baptized may have obtained grace
by the invocation of the Trinity, of the names of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. Then this will be the wisdom which Paul writes is in those who are perfected. But
who in the Church is perfect and wise who can either defend or believe this, that this bare
invocation of names is sufficient to the remission of sins and the sanctification of baptism;
since these things are only then of advantage, when both he who baptizes has the Holy
Spirit, and the baptism itself also is not ordained without the Spirit? But, say they, he who
in any manner whatever is baptized without, may obtain the grace of baptism by his disposition
and faith, which doubtless is ridiculous in itself, as if either a wicked disposition could
attract to itself from heaven the sanctification of the righteous, or a false faith the truth of
believers. But that not all who call on the name of Christ are heard, and that their invocation
cannot obtain any grace, the Lord Himself manifests, saying, “Many shall come in my name,

false prophet and a heretic. For as the former deceives in the name of God or Christ, so the
latter deceives in the sacrament of baptism. Both strive by falsehood to deceive men’s wills.</p>
<p>10. But I wish to relate to you some facts concerning a circumstance which occurred
among us, pertaining to this very matter. About two-and-twenty years ago, in the times
after the Emperor Alexander, there happened in these parts many struggles and difficulties,
either in general to all men, or privately to Christians. Moreover, there were many and frequent
earthquakes, so that many places were overthrown throughout Cappadocia and
Pontus; even certain cities, dragged into the abyss, were swallowed up by the opening of the
gaping earth. So that from this also a severe persecution arose against us of the Christian
name; and this after the long peace of the previous age arose suddenly, and with its unusual
evils was made more terrible for the disturbance of our people. Serenianus was then governor
in our province, a bitter and terrible persecutor. But the faithful being set in this state of
disturbance, and fleeing hither and thither for fear of the persecution, and leaving their
country and passing over into other regions—for there was an opportunity of passing over,
for the reason that that persecution was not over the whole world, but was local—there arose
among us on a sudden a certain woman, who in a state of ecstasy announced herself as a
prophetess, and acted as if filled with the Holy Ghost. And she was so moved by the impetus
of the principal demons, that for a long time she made anxious and deceived the brotherhood,
accomplishing certain wonderful and portentous things, and promised that she would cause
the earth to be shaken. Not that the power of the demon was so great that he could prevail
to shake the earth, or to disturb the elements; but that sometimes a wicked spirit, prescient,
and perceiving that there will be an earthquake, pretends that he will do what he sees will
happen. By these lies and boastings he had so subdued the minds of individuals, that they
obeyed him and followed whithersoever he commanded and led. He would also make that
woman walk in the keen winter with bare feet over frozen snow, and not to be troubled or
hurt in any degree by that walking. Moreover, she would say that she was hurrying to Judea
and to Jerusalem, feigning as if she had come thence. Here also she deceived one of the
presbyters, a countryman, and another, a deacon, so that they had intercourse with that
same woman, which was shortly afterwards detected. For on a sudden there appeared unto
her one of the exorcists, a man approved and always of good conversation in respect of religious
discipline; who, stimulated by the exhortation also of very many brethren who were
themselves strong and praiseworthy in the faith, raised himself up against that wicked
spirit to overcome it; which moreover, by its subtile fallacy, had predicted this a little while
before, that a certain adverse and unbelieving tempter would come. Yet that exorcist, inspired
by God’s grace, bravely resisted, and showed that that which was before thought holy, was
indeed a most wicked spirit. But that woman, who previously by wiles and deceitfulness of
the demon was attempting many things for the deceiving of the faithful, among other things
by which she had deceived many, also had frequently dared this; to pretend that with an

<pb n="941"/>
invocation not to be contemned she sanctified bread and celebrated2934 the Eucharist, and
to offer sacrifice to the Lord, not without the sacrament of the accustomed utterance; and
also to baptize many, making use of the usual and lawful words of interrogation, that nothing
might seem to be different from the ecclesiastical rule.</p>
<p>11. What, then, shall we say about the baptism of this woman, by which a most wicked
demon baptized through means of a woman? Do Stephen and they who agree with him
approve of this also especially when neither the symbol of the Trinity nor the legitimate and
ecclesiastical interrogatory were wanting to her? Can it be believed that either remission
of sins was given, or the regeneration of the saving laver duly completed, when all things,
although after the image of truth, yet were done by a demon? Unless, perchance, they who
defend the baptism of heretics contend that the demon also conferred the grace of baptism
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Among them, no doubt,
there is the same error—it is the very deceitfulness of devils, since among them the Holy
Spirit is not at all.</p>
<p>12. Moreover, what is the meaning of that which Stephen would assert, that the presence
and holiness of Christ is with those who are baptized among heretics? For if the apostle does
not speak falsely when he says, “As many of you as are baptized into Christ, have put on
Christ,”2935 certainly he who has been baptized among them into Christ, has put on Christ.
But if he has put on Christ, he might also receive the Holy Ghost, who was sent by Christ,
and hands are vainly laid upon him who comes to us for the reception of the Spirit; unless,
perhaps, he has not put on the Spirit from Christ, so that Christ indeed may be with heretics,
but the Holy Spirit not be with them.</p>
<p>13. But let us briefly run through the other matters also, which were spoken of by you
abundantly and most fully, especially as Rogatianus, our well-beloved deacon, is hurrying
to you. For it follows that they must be asked by us, when they defend heretics, whether
their baptism is carnal or spiritual. For if it is carnal, they differ in no respect from the
baptism of the Jews, which they use in such a manner that in it, as if in a common and vulgar
laver, only external filth is washed away. But if it is spiritual, how can baptism be spiritual
among those among whom there is no Holy Spirit? And thus the water wherewith they are
washed is to them only a carnal washing, not a sacrament of baptism.</p>
<p>14. But if the baptism of heretics can have the regeneration of the second birth, those
who are baptized among them must be counted not heretics, but children of God. For the
second birth, which occurs in baptism, begets sons of God. But if the spouse of Christ is
one, which is the Catholic Church, it is she herself who alone bears sons of God. For there
are not many spouses of Christ, since the apostle says, “I have espoused you, that I may

<note type="footnote">2935 Gal. iii. 27.</note>

<pb n="942"/>
present you as a chaste virgin to Christ;”2936 and, “Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and
incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, for the King hath greatly desired thy
beauty;”2937 and, “Come with me, my spouse, from Lebanon; thou shalt come, and shalt
pass over from the source of thy faith;”2938 and, “I am come into my garden, my sister, my
spouse.”2939 We see that one person is everywhere set forward, because also the spouse is
one. But the synagogue of heretics is not one with us, because the spouse is not an adulteress
and a harlot. Whence also she cannot bear children of God; unless, as appears to Stephen,
heresy indeed brings them forth and exposes them, while the Church takes them up when
exposed, and nourishes those for her own whom she has not born, although she cannot be
the mother of strange children. And therefore Christ our Lord, setting forth that His spouse
is one, and declaring the sacrament of His unity, says, “He that is not with me is against me,
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.”2940 For if Christ is with us, but the heretics
are not with us, certainly the heretics are in opposition to Christ; and if we gather with
Christ, but the heretics do not gather with us, doubtless they scatter.</p>
<p>15. But neither must we pass over what has been necessarily remarked by you, that the
Church, according to the Song of Songs, is a garden enclosed, and a fountain sealed, a
paradise with the fruit of apples.2941 They who have never entered into this garden, and
have not seen the paradise planted by God the Creator, how shall they be able to afford to
another the living water of the saving lava from the fountain which is enclosed within, and
sealed with a divine seal? And as the ark of Noah was nothing else than the sacrament of
the Church of Christ, which then, when all without were perishing, kept those only safe who
were within the ark, we are manifestly instructed to look to the unity of the Church. Even
as also the Apostle Peter laid down, saying, “Thus also shall baptism in like manner make
you safe;”2942 showing that as they who were not in the ark with Noah not only were not
purged and saved by water, but at once perished in that deluge; so now also, whoever are
not in the Church with Christ will perish outside, unless they are converted by penitence
to the only and saving lava of the Church.</p>
<p>16. But what is the greatness of his error, and what the depth of his blindness, who says
that remission of sins can be granted in the synagogues of heretics, and does not abide on
the foundation of the one Church which was once based by Christ upon the rock, may be

perceived from this, that Christ said to Peter alone, “Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”
2943 And again, in the Gospel, when Christ breathed on the apostles alone, saying, “Receive
ye the Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them, and whose
soever sins ye retain they are retained.”2944 Therefore the power of remitting sins was given
to the apostles, and to the churches which they, sent by Christ, established, and to the bishops
who succeeded to them by vicarious ordination.2945 But the enemies of the one Catholic
Church in which we are, and the adversaries of us who have succeeded the apostles, asserting
for themselves, in opposition to us, unlawful priesthoods, and setting up profane altars,
what else are they than Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, profane with a like wickedness, and
about to suffer the same punishments which they did, as well as those who agree with them,
just as their partners and abettors perished with a like death to theirs?</p>
<p>17. And in this respect I am justly indignant at this so open and manifest folly of
Stephen, that he who so boasts of the place of his episcopate, and contends that he holds
the succession from Peter,2946 on whom the foundations of the Church were laid, should
introduce many other rocks and establish new buildings of many churches; maintaining
that there is baptism in them by his authority. For they who are baptized, doubtless, fill up
the number of the Church. But he who approves their baptism maintains, of those baptized,
that the Church is also with them. Nor does he understand that the truth of the Christian
Rock is overshadowed, and in some measure abolished, by him when he thus betrays and
deserts unity.2947 The apostle acknowledges that the Jews, although blinded by ignorance,
and bound by the grossest wickedness, have yet a zeal for God. Stephen, who announces
that he holds by succession the throne of Peter, is stirred with no zeal against heretics, when
he concedes to them, not a moderate, but the very greatest power of grace: so far as to say
and assert that, by the sacrament of baptism, the filth of the old man is washed away by

them, that they pardon the former mortal sins, that they make sons of God by heavenly regeneration,
and renew to eternal life by the sanctification of the divine laver. He who concedes
and gives up to heretics in this way the great and heavenly gifts of the Church, what else
does he do but communicate with them for whom he maintains and claims so much grace?
And now he hesitates in vain to consent to them, and to be a partaker with them in other
matters also, to meet together with them, and equally with them to mingle their prayers,
and appoint a common altar and sacrifice.</p>
<p>18. But, says he, “the name of Christ is of great advantage to faith and the sanctification
of baptism; so that whosoever is anywhere so-ever baptized in the name of Christ, immediately
obtains the grace of Christ:” although this position may be briefly met and answered,
that if baptism without in the name of Christ availed for the cleansing of man; in the name
of the same Christ, the imposition of hands might avail also for the reception of the Holy
Spirit; and the other things also which are done among heretics will begin to seem just and
lawful when they are done in the name of Christ; as you have maintained in your letter that
the name of Christ could be of no avail except in the Church alone, to which alone Christ
has conceded the power of heavenly grace.</p>
<p>19. But with respect to the refutation of custom which they seem to oppose to the truth,
who is so foolish as to prefer custom to truth, or when he sees the light, not to forsake the
darkness?—unless most ancient custom in any respect avail the Jews, upon the advent of
Christ, that is, the Truth, in remaining in their old usage, and forsaking the new way of
truth. And this indeed you Africans are able to say against Stephen, that when you knew
the truth you forsook the error of custom. But we join custom to truth, and to the Romans’
custom we oppose custom, but the custom of truth; holding from the beginning that which
was delivered by Christ and the apostles.2948 Nor do we remember that this at any time
began among us, since it has always been observed here, that we knew none but one Church
of God, and accounted no baptism holy except that of the holy Church. Certainly, since
some doubted about the baptism of those who, although they receive the new prophets,2949
yet appear to recognise the same Father and Son with us; very many of us meeting together
in Iconium very carefully examined the matter, and we decided that every baptism was altogether
to be rejected which is arranged for without the Church.2950</p>
<p>20. But to what they allege and say on behalf of the heretics, that the apostle said,
“Whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached,”2951 it is idle for us to reply; when it

<note type="footnote">2950 [See sec. 7, supra.]</note>
<note type="footnote">2951 Phil. i. 18.</note>

<pb n="945"/>
is manifest that the apostle, in his epistle wherein he said this, made mention neither of
heretics nor of baptism of heretics, but spoke of brethren only, whether as perfidiously
speaking in agreement with himself, or as persevering in sincere faith; nor is it needful to
discuss this in a long argument, but it is sufficient to read the epistle itself, and to gather
from the apostle himself what the apostle said.</p>
<p>21. What then, say they, will become of those who, coming from the heretics, have been
received without the baptism of the Church? If they have departed this life, they are reckoned
in the number of those who have been catechumens indeed among us, but have died before
they were baptized,—no trifling2952 advantage of truth and faith, to which they had attained
by forsaking error, although, being prevented by death, they had not gained the consummation
of grace.2953 But they who still abide in life should be baptized with the baptism of the
Church, that they may obtain remission of sins, lest by the presumption of others they remain
in their old error, and die without the completion of grace. But what a crime is theirs on the
one hand who receive, or on the other, theirs who are received, that their foulness not being
washed away by the laver of the Church, nor their sins put away, communion being rashly
seized, they touch the body and blood of the Lord, although it is written, “Whosoever shall
eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood
of the Lord!”2954</p>
<p>22. We have judged, that those also whom they, who had formerly been bishops in the
Catholic Church, and afterwards had assumed to themselves the power of clerical ordination,
had baptized, are to be regarded as not baptized. And this is observed among us, that whosoever
dipped by them come to us are baptized among us as strangers and having obtained
nothing, with the only and true baptism of the Catholic Church, and obtain the regeneration
of the laver of life. And yet there is a great difference between him who unwillingly and
constrained by the necessity of persecution has given way, and him who with a profane will
boldly rebels against the Church, or with impious voice blasphemes against the Father and
God of Christ and the Creator of the whole world. And Stephen is not ashamed to assert
and to say that remission of sins can be granted by those who are themselves set fast in all
kinds of sins, as if in the house of death there could be the laver of salvation.</p>
<p>23. What, then, is to be made of what is written, “Abstain from strange water, and drink
not from a strange fountain,”2955 if, leaving the sealed fountain of the Church, you take up
strange water for your own, and pollute the Church with unhallowed fountains? For when
you communicate with the baptism of heretics, what else do you do than drink from their

slough and mud; and while you yourself are purged with the Church’s sanctification, you
become befouled with the contact of the filth of others? And do you not fear the judgment
of God when you are giving testimony to heretics in opposition to the Church, although it
is written, “A false witness shall not be unpunished?”2956 But indeed you are worse than all
heretics. For when many, as soon as their error is known, come over to you from them that
they may receive the true light of the Church, you assist the errors of those who come, and,
obscuring the light of ecclesiastical truth, you heap up the darkness of the heretical night;
and although they confess that they are in sins, and have no grace, and therefore come to
the Church, you take away from them remission of sins, which is given in baptism, by saying
that they are already baptized and have obtained the grace of the Church outside the Church,
and you do not perceive that their souls will be required at your hands when the day of
judgment shall come, for having denied to the thirsting the drink of the Church, and having
been the occasion of death to those that were desirious of living. And, after all this, you are
indignant!</p>
<p>24. Consider with what want of judgment you dare to blame those who strive for the
truth against falsehood. For who ought more justly to be indignant against the other?—whether
he who supports God’s enemies, or he who, in opposition to him who supports God’s
enemies, unites with us on behalf of the truth of the Church?—except that it is plain that
the ignorant are also excited and angry, because by the want of counsel and discourse they
are easily turned to wrath; so that of none more than of you does divine Scripture say, “A
wrathful man stirreth up strifes, and a furious man heapeth up sins.”2957 For what strifes
and dissensions have you stirred up throughout the churches of the whole world! Moreover,
how great sin have you heaped up for yourself, when you cut yourself off from so many
flocks! For it is yourself that you have cut off. Do not deceive yourself, since he is really the
schismatic who has made himself an apostate from the communion of ecclesiastical unity.2958
For while you think that all may be excommunicated by you, you have excommunicated
yourself alone from all; and not even the precepts of an apostle have been able to mould you
to the rule of truth and peace, although he warned, and said, “I therefore, the prisoner of
the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all
lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavouring
to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, even
as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and
Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.”2959</p>

<pb n="947"/>
<p>25. How carefully has Stephen fulfilled these salutary commands and warnings of the
apostle, keeping in the first place lowliness of mind and meekness! For what is more lowly
or meek than to have disagreed with so many bishops throughout the whole world, breaking
peace with each one of them in various kinds of discord:2960 at one time with the eastern
churches, as we are sure you know; at another time with you who are in the south, from
whom he received bishops as messengers sufficiently patiently and meekly not to receive
them even to the speech of an ordinary conference; and even more, so mindful of love and
charity as to command the entire fraternity, that no one should receive them into his house,
so that not only peace and communion, but also a shelter and entertainment, were denied
to them when they came! This is to have kept the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,
to cut himself off from the unity of love,2961 and to make himself a stranger in all respects
from his brethren, and to rebel against the sacrament and the faith with the madness of
contumacious discord! With such a man can there be one Spirit and one body, in whom
perchance there is not even one mind, so slippery, and shifting, and uncertain is it?</p>
<p>26. But as far as he is concerned, let us leave him;2962 let us rather deal with that concerning
which there is the greatest question. They who contend that persons baptized among
the heretics ought to be received as if they had obtained the grace of lawful baptism, say that
baptism is one and the same to them and to us, and differs in no respect. But what says the
Apostle Paul? “One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.”2963 If the baptism of heretics
be one and the same with ours, without doubt their faith also is one; but if our faith is one,
assuredly also we have one Lord: if there is one Lord, it follows that we say that He is one.2964
But if this unity which cannot be separated and divided at all, is itself also among heretics,
why do we contend any more? Why do we call them heretics and not Christians? Moreover,
since we and heretics have not one God, nor one Lord, nor one Church, nor one faith, nor
even one Spirit, nor one body, it is manifest that neither can baptism be common to us with
heretics, since between us there is nothing at all in common. And yet Stephen is not ashamed
to afford patronage to such in opposition to the Church, and for the sake of maintaining
heretics to divide the brotherhood and in addition, to call Cyprian “a false Christ and a false

<p>To Magnus, on Baptizing the Novatians, and Those Who Obtain Grace on a
Sick-Bed.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Former Part of This Letter is of the Same Tenor with Those that
Precede, Except that He Inculcates Concerning the Novatians What He Had in
Substance Said Concerning All Heretics; Moreover, Insinuating by the Way that
the Legitimate Succession of Cornelius at Rome is Known, as the Church May

Has Been Wrongly Published as a Separate Letter) He Teaches that that is a True
Baptism Wherein One is Baptized by Sprinkling on a Sick-Bed, as Well as by
Immersion in the Church.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Magnus his son, greeting. With your usual religious diligence, you have
consulted my poor intelligence, dearest son, as to whether, among other heretics, they also
who come from Novatian ought, after his profane washing, to be baptized, and sanctified
in the Catholic Church, with the lawful, and true, and only baptism of the Church. Respecting
which matter, as much as the capacity of my faith and the sanctity and truth of the divine
Scriptures suggest, I answer, that no heretics and schismatics at all have any power or right.
For which reason Novatian neither ought to be nor can be expected, inasmuch as he also is
without the Church and acting in opposition to the peace and love of Christ, from being
counted among adversaries and antichrists. For our Lord Jesus Christ, when He testified in
His Gospel that those who were not with Him were His adversaries, did not point out any
species of heresy, but showed that all whatsoever who were not with Him, and who, not
gathering with Him, were scattering His flock, were His adversaries; saying, “He that is not
with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.”2968 Moreover, the
blessed Apostle John himself distinguished no heresy or schism, neither did he set down
any as specially separated; but he called all who had gone out from the Church, and who
acted in opposition to the Church, antichrists, saying, “Ye have heard that Antichrist cometh,
and even now are come many antichrists; wherefore we know that this is the last time. They
went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued
with us.”2969 Whence it appears, that all are adversaries of the Lord and antichrists,
who are known to have departed from charity and from the unity of the Catholic Church.
In addition, moreover, the Lord establishes it in His Gospel, and says, “But if he neglect to

<pb n="950"/>
hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican.”2970 Now if they
who despise the Church are counted heathens and publicans, much more certainly is it necessary
that rebels and enemies, who forge false altars, and lawless priesthoods, and sacrilegious
sacrifices, and corrupted names, should be counted among heathens and publicans;
since they who sin less, and are only despisers of the Church, are by the Lord’s sentence
judged to be heathens and publicans.</p>
<p>2. But that the Church is one, the Holy Spirit declares in the Song of Songs, saying, in
the person of Christ, “My dove, my undefiled, is one; she is the only one of her mother, she
is the choice one of her that bare her.”2971 Concerning which also He says again, “A garden
enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring sealed up, a well of living water.”2972 But if the
spouse of Christ, which is the Church, is a garden enclosed; a thing that is closed up cannot
lie open to strangers and profane persons. And if it is a fountain sealed, he who, being placed
without has no access to the spring, can neither drink thence nor be sealed. And the well
also of living water, if it is one and the same within, he who is placed without cannot be
quickened and sanctified from that water of which it is only granted to those who are within
to make any use, or to drink. Peter also, showing this, set forth that the Church is one, and
that only they who are in the Church can be baptized; and said, “In the ark of Noah, few,
that is, eight souls, were saved by water; the like figure where-unto even baptism shall save
you;”2973 proving and attesting that the one ark of Noah was a type of the one Church. If,
then, in that baptism of the world thus expiated and purified, he who was not in the ark of
Noah could be saved by water, he who is not in the Church to which alone baptism is
granted, can also now be quickened by baptism. Moreover, too, the Apostle Paul, more
openly and clearly still manifesting this same thing, writes to the Ephesians, and says, “Christ
loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the
washing of water.”2974 But if the Church is one which is loved by Christ, and is alone cleansed
by His washing, how can he who is not in the Church be either loved by Christ, or washed
and cleansed by His washing?</p>
<p>3. Wherefore, since the Church alone has the living water, and the power of baptizing
and cleansing man, he who says that any one can be baptized and sanctified by Novatian
must first show and teach that Novatian is in the Church or presides over the Church. For
the Church is one, and as she is one, cannot be both within and without. For if she is with

Novatian, she was not with Cornelius.2975 But if she was with Cornelius, who succeeded
the bishop Fabian by lawful ordination, and whom, beside the honour of the priesthood,
the Lord glorified also with martyrdom, Novatian is not in the Church; nor can he be
reckoned as a bishop, who, succeeding to no one, and despising the evangelical and
apostolic tradition, sprang from himself. For he who has not been ordained in the Church
can neither have nor hold to the Church in any way.</p>
<p>4. For the faith of the sacred Scripture sets forth that the Church is not without, nor can
be separated nor divided against itself, but maintains the unity of an inseparable and undivided
house; since it is written of the sacrament of the passover, and of the lamb, which
Lamb designated Christ: “In one house shall it be eaten: ye shall not carry forth the flesh
abroad out of the house.”2976 Which also we see expressed concerning Rahab, who herself
also bore a type of the Church, who received the command which said, “Thou shalt bring
thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household unto thee into
thine house; and whosoever shall go out of the doors of thine house into the street, his blood
shall be upon him.”2977 In which mystery is declared, that they who will live, and escape
from the destruction of the world, must be gathered together into one house alone, that is,
into the Church; but whosoever of those thus collected together shall go out abroad, that is,
if any one, although he may have obtained grace in the Church, shall depart and go out of
the Church, that his blood shall be upon him; that is, that he himself must charge it upon
himself that he perishes; which the Apostle Paul explains, teaching and enjoining that a
heretic must be avoided, as perverse, and a sinner, and as condemned of himself. For that
man will be guilty of his own ruin, who, not being cast out by the bishop, but of his own
accord deserting from the Church is by heretical presumption condemned of himself.</p>
<p>5. And therefore the Lord, suggesting to us a unity that comes from divine authority,
lays it down, saying, “I and my Father are one.”2978 To which unity reducing His Church,
He says again, “And there shall be one flock,2979 and one shepherd.”2980 But if the flock is
one, how can he be numbered among the flock who is not in the number of the flock? Or
how can he be esteemed a pastor, who,—while the true shepherd remains and presides over
the Church of God by successive ordination,—succeeding to no one, and beginning from
himself, becomes a stranger and a profane person, an enemy of the Lord’s peace and of the

divine unity, not dwelling in the house of God, that is, in the Church of God, in which none
dwell except they are of one heart and one mind, since the Holy Spirit speaks in the Psalms,
and says, “It is God who maketh men to dwell of one mind in a house.”2981</p>
<p>6. Besides even the Lord’s sacrifices themselves declare that Christian unanimity is
linked together with itself by a firm and inseparable charity. For when the Lord calls bread,
which is combined by the union of many grains, His body, He indicates our people whom
He bore as being united; and when He calls the wine, which is pressed from many grapes
and clusters and collected together, His blood, He also signifies our flock linked together
by the mingling of a united multitude.2982 If Novatian is united to this bread of the Lord,
if he also is mingled with this cup of Christ, he may also seem to be able to have the grace
of the one baptism of the Church, if it be manifest that he holds the unity of the Church. In
fine, how inseparable is the sacrament of unity, and how hopeless are they, and what excessive
ruin they earn for themselves from the indignation of God, who make a schism, and, forsaking
their bishop,2983 appoint another false bishop for themselves without,—Holy Scripture declares
in the books of Kings; where ten tribes were divided from the tribe of Judah and
Benjamin, and, forsaking their king, appointed for themselves another one without. It says,
“And the Lord was very angry with all the seed of Israel, and removed them away, and delivered
them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight; for Israel
was scattered from the house of David, and they made themselves a king, Jeroboam the son
of Nebat.”2984 It says that the Lord was very angry, and gave them up to perdition, because
they were scattered from unity, and had made another king for themselves. And so great
was the indignation of the Lord against those who had made the schism, that even when
the man of God was sent to Jeroboam, to charge upon him his sins, and predict the future
vengeance, he was forbidden to eat bread or to drink water with them. And when he did
not observe this, and took meat against the command of God, he was immediately smitten
by the majesty of the divine judgment, so that returning thence he was slain on the way by
the jaws of a lion which attacked him. And dares any one to say that the saving water of
baptism and heavenly grace can be in common with schismatics, with whom neither earthly
food nor worldly drink ought to be in common? Moreover, the Lord satisfies us in His
Gospel, and shows forth a still greater light of intelligence, that the same persons who had
then divided themselves from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and forsaking Jerusalem

had seceded to Samaria, should be reckon among profane persons and Gentiles. For when
first He sent His disciples on the ministry of salvation, He bade them, saying, “Go not into
the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.”2985 Sending first
to the Jews, He commands the Gentiles as yet to be passed over; but by adding that even the
city of the Samaritans was to be omitted, where there were schismatics, He shows that
schismatics were to be put on the same level as Gentiles.</p>
<p>7. But if any one objects, by way of saying that Novatian holds the same law which the
Catholic Church holds, baptizes with the same symbol with which we baptize, knows the
same God and Father, the same Christ the Son, the same Holy Spirit, and that for this reason
he may claim the power of baptizing, namely, that he seems not to differ from us in the
baptismal interrogatory; let any one that thinks that this may be objected, know first of all,
that there is not one law of the Creed, nor the same interrogatory common to us and to
schismatics. For when they say, “Dost thou believe the remission of sins and life eternal
through the holy Church?” they lie in their interrogatory, since they have not the Church.
Then, besides, with their own voice they themselves confess that remission of sins cannot
be given except by the holy Church; and not having this, they show that sins cannot be remitted
among them.</p>
<p>8. But that they are said to have the same God the Father as we, to know the same Christ
the Son, the same Holy Spirit, can be of no avail to such as these. For even Korah, Dathan,
and Abiram knew the same God as did the priest Aaron and Moses. Living under the same
law and religion, they invoke the one and true God, who was to be invoked and worshipped;
yet, because they transgressed the ministry of their office in opposition to Aaron the priest,
who had received the legitimate priesthood by the condescension of God and the ordination
of the Lord, and claimed to themselves the power of sacrificing, divinely stricken, they immediately
suffered punishment for their unlawful endeavours; and sacrifices offered irreligiously
and lawlessly, contrary to the right of divine appointment, could not be accepted,
nor profit them. Even those very censers in which incense had been lawlessly offered, lest
they should any more be used by the priests, but that they might rather exhibit a memorial
of the divine vengeance and indignation for the correction of their successors, being by the
command of the Lord melted and purged by fire, were beaten out into flexible plates, and
fastened to the altars, according to what the Holy Scripture says, “to be,” it says, “a memorial
to the children of Israel, that no stranger which is not of the seed of Aaron come near to
offer incense before the Lord, that he be not as Korah.”2986 And yet those men had not made
a schism, nor had gone out abroad, and in opposition to God’s priests rebelled shamelessly
and with hostility; but this these men are now doing who divide the Church, and, as rebels

against the peace and unity of Christ, attempt to establish a throne for themselves, and to
assume the primacy,2987 and to claim the right of baptizing and of offering. How can they
complete what they do, or obtain anything by lawless endeavours from God, seeing that
they are endeavouring against God what is not lawful to them? Wherefore they who patronize
Novatian or other schismatics of that kind, contend in vain that any one can be baptized
and sanctified with a saving baptism among them, when it is plain that he who baptizes has
not the power of baptizing.</p>
<p>9. And, moreover, that it may be better understood what is the divine judgment against
audacity of the like kind, we find that in such wickedness, not only the leaders and originators,
but also the partakers, are destined to punishment, unless they have separated themselves
from the communion of the wicked; as the Lord by Moses commands, and says, “Separate
yourselves from the tents of these most hardened men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye
be consumed in their sins.”2988 And what the Lord had threatened by Moses He fulfilled,
that whosoever had not separated himself from Korah, and Dathan, and Abiram, immediately
suffered punishment for his impious communion. By which example is shown and proved,
that all will be liable to guilt as well as its punishment, who with irreligious boldness mingle
themselves with schismatics in opposition to prelates and priests; even as also by the
prophet Osea the Holy Spirit witnesses, and says, “Their sacrifices shall be unto them as the
bread of mourning; all that thereof shall be polluted;”2989 teaching, doubtless, and showing
that all are absolutely joined with the leaders in punishment, who have been contaminated
by their crime.</p>
<p>10. What, then, can be their deservings in the sight of God, on whom punishment are
divinely denounced? or how can such persons justify and sanctify the baptized, who, being
enemies of the priests, strive to usurp things foreign and lawless, and by no right conceded
to them? And yet we do not wonder that, in accordance with their wickedness, they do
contend for them. For it is necessary that each one of them should maintain what they do;
nor when vanquished will they easily yield, although they know that what they do is not
lawful. That is to be wondered at, yea, rather to be indignant and aggrieved at, that Christians
should support antichrists; and that prevaricators of the faith, and betrayers of the Church,
should stand within in the Church itself.2990 And these, although otherwise obstinate and
unteachable, yet still at least confess this—that all, whether heretics or schismatics, are
without the Holy Ghost, and therefore can indeed baptize, but cannot confer the Holy

Spirit; and at this very point they are held fast by us, inasmuch as we show that those who
have not the Holy Ghost are not able to baptize at all.</p>
<p>11. For since in baptism every one has his own sins remitted, the Lord proves and declares
in His Gospel that sins can only be put away by those who have the Holy Spirit. For after
His resurrection, sending forth His disciples, He speaks to them, and says, “As the Father
hath sent me, even so send I you. And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and
said to them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose soever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted
unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.”2991 In which place He
shows, that he alone can baptize and give remission of sins who has the Holy Spirit. Moreover,
John, who was to baptize Christ our Lord Himself, previously received the Holy Ghost while
he was yet in his mother’s womb, that it might be certain and manifest that none can baptize
save those who have the Holy Spirit. Therefore those who patronize heretics or schismatics
must answer us whether they have or have not the Holy Ghost. If they have, why are hands
imposed on those who are baptized among them when they come to us, that they may receive
the Holy Ghost, since He must surely have been received there, where if He was He could
be given? But if heretics and schismatics baptized without have not the Holy Spirit, and
therefore hands are imposed on them among us, that here may be received what there neither
is nor can be given; it is plain, also, that remission of sins cannot be given by those who, it
is certain, have not the Holy Spirit. And therefore, in order that, according to the divine
arrangement and the evangelical truth, they may be able to obtain remission of sins, and to
be sanctified, and to become temples of God, they must all absolutely be baptized with the
baptism of the Church who come from adversaries and antichrists to the Church of Christ.</p>
<p>12. You have asked also, dearest son, what I thought of those who obtain God’s grace
in sickness and weakness, whether they are to be accounted legitimate Christians, for that
they are not to be washed, but sprinkled, with the saving water. In this point, my diffidence
and modesty prejudges none, so as to prevent any from feeling what he thinks right, and
from doing what he feels to be right.2992 As far as my poor understanding conceives it, I
think that the divine benefits can in no respect be mutilated and weakened; nor can anything
less occur in that case, where, with full and entire faith both of the giver and receiver, is ac-
cepted what is drawn from the divine gifts. For in the sacrament of salvation the contagion
of sins is not in such wise washed away, as the filth of the skin and of the body is washed
away in the carnal and ordinary washing, as that there should be need of saltpetre and other
appliances also, and a bath and a basin wherewith this vile body must be washed and purified.
Otherwise is the breast of the believer washed; otherwise is the mind of man purified by the

<pb n="956"/>
merit of faith. In the sacraments of salvation, when necessity compels, and God bestows
His mercy, the divine methods confer the whole benefit on believers; nor ought it to trouble
any one that sick people seem to be sprinkled or affused, when they obtain the Lord’s grace,
when Holy Scripture speaks by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel, and says, “Then will I
sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all
your idols will I cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put
within you.”2993 Also in Numbers: “And the man that shall be unclean until the evening
shall be purified on the third day, and on the seventh day shall be clean: but if he shall not
be purified on the third day, on the seventh day he shall not be clean. And that soul shall be
cut off from Israel: because the water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled upon him.”2994
And again: “And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, Take the Levites from among the children
of Israel, and cleanse them. And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: thou
shalt sprinkle them with the water of purification.”2995 And again: “The water of sprinkling
is a purification.”2996 Whence it appears that the sprinkling also of water prevails equally
with the washing of salvation; and that when this is done in the Church, where the faith
both of receiver and giver is sound, all things hold and may be consummated and perfected
by the majesty of the Lord and by the truth of faith.</p>
<p>13. But, moreover, in respect of some calling those who have obtained the peace of
Christ by the saving water and by legitimate faith, not Christians, but Clinics, I do not find
whence they take up this name, unless perhaps, having read more, and of a more recondite
kind, they have taken these Clinics from Hippocrates or Soranus.2997 For I, who know of a
Clinic in the Gospel, know that to that paralytic and infirm man, who lay on his bed during
the long course of his life, his infirmity presented no obstacle to his attainment in the fullest
degree of heavenly strength. Nor was he only raised from his bed by the divine indulgence,
but he also took up his bed itself with his restored and increased strength. And therefore,
as far as it is allowed me by faith to conceive and to think, this is my opinion, that any one
should be esteemed a legitimate Christian, who by the law and right of faith shall have obtained
the grace of God in the Church. Or if any one think that those have gained nothing
by having only been sprinkled with the saving water, but that they are still empty and void,
let them not be deceived, so as if they escape the evil of their sickness, and get well, they

should seek to be baptized.2998 But if they cannot be baptized who have already been sanctified
by ecclesiastical baptism, why are they offended in respect of their faith and the mercy of
the Lord? Or have they obtained indeed the divine favour, but in a shorter and more limited
measure of the divine gift and of the Holy Spirit, so as indeed to be esteemed Christians,
but yet not to be counted equal with others?</p>
<p>14. Nay, verily, the Holy Spirit is not given by measure, but is poured out altogether on
the believer. For if the day rises alike to all, and if the sun is diffused with like and equal
light over all, how much more does Christ, who is the true sun and the true day, bestow in
His Church the light of eternal life with the like equality! Of which equality we see the sacrament
celebrated in Exodus, when the manna flowed down from heaven, and, prefiguring
the things to come, showed forth the nourishment of the heavenly bread and the food of
the coming Christ. For there, without distinction either of sex or of age, an omer was collected
equally by each one.2999 Whence it appeared that the mercy of Christ, and the heavenly
grace that would subsequently follow, was equally divided among all; without difference of
sex, without distinction of years, without accepting of persons, upon all the people of God
the gift of spiritual grace was shed. Assuredly the same spiritual grace which is equally received
in baptism by believers, is subsequently either increased or diminished in our conversation
and conduct; as in the Gospel the Lord’s seed is equally sown, but, according to the
variety of the soil, some is wasted, and some is increased into a large variety of plenty, with
an exuberant fruit of either thirty or sixty or a hundred fold. But, once more, when each
was called to receive a penny, wherefore should what is distributed equally by God be diminished
by human interpretation?</p>
<p>15. But if any one is moved by this, that some of those who are baptized in sickness are
still tempted by unclean spirits, let him know that the obstinate wickedness of the devil
prevails even up to the saving water, but that in baptism it loses all the poison of his
wickedness. An instance of this we see in the king Pharaoh, who, having struggled long, and
delayed in his perfidy, could resist and prevail until he came to the water; but when he had
come thither, he was both conquered and destroyed. And that that sea was a sacrament of
baptism, the blessed Apostle Paul declares, saying, “Brethren, I would not have you ignorant
how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all
baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;” and he added, saying, “Now all these
things were our examples.”3000 And this also is done in the present day, in that the devil is
scourged, and burned, and tortured by exorcists, by the human voice, and by divine

power;3001 and although he often says that he is going out, and will leave the men of God,
yet in that which he says he deceives, and puts in practice what was before done by Pharaoh
with the same obstinate and fraudulent deceit. When, however, they come to the water of
salvation and to the sanctification of baptism, we ought to know and to trust that there the
devil is beaten down, and the man, dedicated to God, is set free by the divine mercy. For as
scorpions and serpents, which prevail on the dry ground, when cast into water, cannot
prevail nor retain their venom; so also the wicked spirits, which are called scorpions and
serpents, and yet are trodden under foot by us, by the power given by the Lord, cannot remain
any longer in the body of a man in whom, baptized and sanctified, the Holy Spirit is beginning
to dwell.</p>
<p>16. This, finally, in very fact also we experience, that those who are baptized by urgent
necessity in sickness, and obtain grace, are free from the unclean spirit wherewith they were
previously moved, and live in the Church in praise and honour, and day by day make more
and more advance in the increase of heavenly grace by the growth of their faith. And, on
the other hand, some of those who are baptized in health, if subsequently they begin to sin,
are shaken by the return of the unclean spirit, so that it is manifest that the devil is driven
out in baptism by the faith of the believer, and returns if the faith afterwards shall fail. Unless,
indeed, it seems just to some, that they who, outside the Church among adversaries and
antichrists, are polluted with profane water, should be judged to be baptized; while they
who are baptized in the Church are thought to have attained less of divine mercy and grace;
and so great consideration be had for heretics, that they who come from heresy are not interrogated
whether they are washed or sprinkled, whether they be clinics or peripatetics;
but among us the sound truth of faith is disparaged, and in ecclesiastical baptism its majesty
and sanctity suffer derogation.3002</p>

modesty in humility, diligence in administration, watchfulness in helping those that suffer,
mercy in cherishing the poor, constancy in defending the truth, judgment in severity of
discipline. And that nothing should be wanting to the example of good deeds in you, even

of your brethren to divine martyrdom, by exhibiting yourselves as leaders of virtue, that
while the flock follows its pastors, and imitates what it sees to be done by those set over it,
it may be crowned with the like merits of obedience by the Lord.</p>
<p>2. But that, being first severely beaten with clubs, and ill-used, you have begun by sufferings
of that kind, the glorious firstlings of your confession, is not a matter to be execrated
by us. For a Christian body is not very greatly terrified at clubs, seeing all its hope is in the
Wood.3006 The servant of Christ acknowledges the sacrament of his salvation: redeemed
by wood to life eternal, he is advanced by wood to the crown. But what wonder if, as golden
and silver vessels, you have been committed to the mine that is the home of gold and silver,
except that now the nature of the mines is changed, and the places which previously had
been accustomed to yield gold and silver have begun to receive them? Moreover, they have
put fetters on your feet, and have bound your blessed limbs, and the temples of God with
disgraceful chains, as if the spirit also could be bound with the body, or your gold could be
stained by the contact of iron. To men who are dedicated to God, and attesting their faith
with religious courage, such things are ornaments, not chains; nor do they bind the feet of
the Christians for infamy, but glorify them for a crown. Oh feet blessedly bound, which are
loosed, not by the smith but by the Lord! Oh feet blessedly bound, which are guided to
paradise in the way of salvation! Oh feet bound for the present time in the world, that they
may be always free with the Lord! Oh feet, lingering for a while among the fetters and crossbars,
3007 but to run quickly to Christ on a glorious road! Let cruelty, either envious or malignant,
hold you here in its bonds and chains as long as it will, from this earth and from
these sufferings you shall speedily come to the kingdom of heaven. The body is not cherished
in the mines with couch and cushions, but it is cherished with the refreshment and solace
of Christ. The frame wearied with labours lies prostrate on the ground, but it is no penalty
to lie down with Christ. Your limbs unbathed, are foul and disfigured with filth and dirt;
but within they are spiritually cleansed, although without the flesh is defiled. There the
bread is scarce; but man liveth not by bread alone, but by the word of God. Shivering, you
want clothing; but he who puts on Christ is both abundantly clothed and adorned. The hair
of your half-shorn head3008 seems repulsive; but since Christ is the head of the man, anything
whatever must needs become that head which is illustrious on account of Christ’s name.
All that deformity, detestable and foul to Gentiles, with what splendour shall it be recompensed!
This temporal and brief suffering, how shall it be exchanged for the reward of a
bright and eternal honour, when, according to the word of the blessed apostle, “the Lord
<note type="footnote">3006 Scil.: “of the cross.” [Fanciful in logic, but our author may be indulged in his rhetoric. It was suited to
the times.]</note>

<note type="footnote">3008 [As of convict criminals. An honourable tonsure.]</note>

<pb n="961"/>
shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like to the body of His
brightness!”3009</p>
<p>3. But there cannot be felt any loss of either religion or faith, most beloved brethren, in
the fact that now there is given no opportunity there to God’s priests for offering and celebrating
the divine sacrifices; yea, you celebrate and offer a sacrifice to God equally3010 precious
and glorious, and that will greatly profit you for the retribution of heavenly rewards, since
the sacred Scripture speaks, saying, “The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit; a contrite and
humbled heart God doth not despise.”3011 You offer this sacrifice to God; you celebrate this
sacrifice without intermission day and night, being made victims to God, and exhibiting
yourselves as holy and unspotted offerings, as the apostle exhorts and says, “I beseech you
therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
holy, acceptable unto God. And be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by
the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect
will of God.”3012</p>
<p>4. For this it is which especially pleases God; it is this wherein our works with greater
deserts are successful in earning God’s good-will; this it is which alone the obedience of our
faith and devotion can render to the Lord for His great and saving benefits, as the Holy
Spirit declares and witnesses in the Psalms: “What shall I render,” says He, “to the Lord for
all His benefits towards me? I will take the cup of salvation, and I will call upon the name
of the Lord. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.”3013 Who would not
gladly and readily receive the cup of salvation? Who would not with joy and gladness desire
that in which he himself also may render somewhat unto His Lord? Who would not bravely
and unfalteringly receive a death precious in the sight of the Lord, to please His eyes, who,
looking down from above upon us who are placed in the conflict for His name, approves
the willing, assists the struggling, crowns the conquering with the recompense of patience,
goodness, and affection, rewarding in us whatever He Himself has bestowed, and honouring
what He has accomplished?</p>
<p>5. For that it is His doing that we conquer, and that we attain by the subduing of the
adversary to the palm of the greatest contest, the Lord declares and teaches in His Gospel,
saying, “But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak; for it
shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the

Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.”3014 And again: “Settle it therefore in your
hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer; for I will give you a mouth and wisdom,
which your adversaries shall not be able to resist.”3015 In which, indeed, is both the great
confidence of believers, and the gravest fault of the faithless, that they do not trust Him who
promises to give His help to those who confess Him, and do not on the other hand fear Him
who threatens eternal punishment to those who deny Him.</p>
<p>6. All which things, most brave and faithful soldiers of Christ, you have suggested to
your brethren, fulfilling in deeds what ye have previously taught in words, hereafter to be
greatest in the kingdom of heaven, as the Lord promises and says, “Whosoever shall do and
teach so, shall be called the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”3016 Moreover, a manifold
portion of the people, following your example, have confessed alike with you, and alike have
been crowned, associated with you in the bond of the strongest charity, and separated from
their prelates neither by the prison nor by the mines; in the number of whom neither are
there wanting virgins in whom the hundred-fold are added to the fruit of sixty-fold, and
whom a double glory has advanced to the heavenly crown. In boys also a courage greater
than their age has surpassed their years in the praise of their confession, so that every sex
and every age should adorn the blessed flock of your martyrdom.3017</p>
<p>7. What now must be the vigour, beloved brethren, of your victorious consciousness,
what the loftiness of your mind, what exultation in feeling, what triumph in your breast,
that every one of you stands near to the promised reward of God, are secure from the
judgment of God, walk in the mines with a body captive indeed, but with a heart reigning,
that you know Christ is present with you, rejoicing in the endurance of His servants, who
are ascending by His footsteps and in His paths to the eternal kingdoms! You daily expect
with joy the saving day of your departure; and already about to withdraw from the world,
you are hastening to the rewards of martyrdom, and to the divine homes, to behold after
this darkness of the world the purest light, and to receive a glory greater than all sufferings
and conflicts, as the apostle witnesses, and says, “The sufferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.”3018 And because now
your word is more effectual in prayers, and supplication is more quick to obtain what is
sought for in afflictions, seek more eagerly, and ask that the divine condescension would
consummate the confession of all of us; that from this darkness and these snares of the world

<p>The Reply of Nemesianus, Dativus, Felix, and Victor, to Cyprian.
Argument.—This Epistle and the Two Following Contain Nothing Else Than 
to the Foregoing, Inasmuch as They Contain The Thanksgiving as Well for the
Comfort Conveyed by the Letter as for the Assistance Sent Therewith. But from
the Fact that Three Distinct Letters are Sent in Reply to the Single One of Cyprian’s,
We are to Gather that the Bishops Who Wrote Them Were Placed in Different
Departments of the Mines.3021</p>
<p>1. Nemesianus, Dativus, Felix, and Victor, to their brother Cyprian, in the Lord eternal
salvation. You speak, dearly beloved Cyprian, in your letters always with deep meaning, as
suits the condition of the time, by the assiduous reading of which letters both the wicked
are corrected and men of good faith are confirmed. For while you do not cease in your
writings to lay bare the hidden mysteries, you thus make us to grow in faith, and men from
the world to draw near to belief. For by whatever good things you have introduced in your
many books, unconsciously you have described yourself to us. For you are greater than all
men in discourse, in speech more eloquent, in counsel wiser, in patience more simple, in
works more abundant, in abstinence more holy, in obedience more humble, and in good
deeds more innocent. And you yourself know, beloved, that our eager wish was, that we
might see you, our teacher and our lover, attain to the crown of a great confession.</p>
<p>2. For, in the proceedings before the proconsul, as a good and true teacher you first have
pronounced that which we your disciples, following you, ought to say before the president.
And, as a sounding trumpet, you have stirred up God’s soldiers, furnished with heavenly
arms, to the close encounter; and fighting in the first rank, you have slain the devil with a
spiritual sword: you have also ordered the troops of the brethren, on the one hand and on
the other, with your words, so that snares were on all sides laid for the enemy, and the
severed sinews of the very carcase of the public foe were trodden under foot.3022 Believe us,
dearest, that your innocent spirit is not far from the hundred-fold reward, seeing that it has
feared neither the first onsets of the world, nor shrunk from going into exile, nor hesitated
to leave the city, nor dreaded to dwell in a desert place; and since it furnished many with an
example of confession, itself first spoke the martyr-witness. For it provoked others to acts
of martyrdom by its own example; and not only began to be a companion of the martyrs

already departing from the world, but also linked a heavenly friendship with those who
should be so.</p>
<p>3. Therefore they who were condemned with us give you before God the greatest thanks,
beloved Cyprian, that in your letter you have refreshed their suffering breasts; have healed
their limbs wounded with clubs; have loosened their feet bound with fetters; have smoothed
the hair of their half-shorn head; have illuminated the darkness of the dungeon; have brought
down the mountains of the mine to a smooth surface; have even placed fragrant flowers to
their nostrils, and have shut out the foul odour of the smoke.3023 Moreover, your continued
gifts, and those of our beloved Quirinus, which you sent to be distributed by Herennianus
the sub-deacon, and Lucian, and Maximus, and Amantius the acolytes, provided a supply
of whatever had been wanting for the necessities of their bodies. Let us, then, be in our
prayers helpers of one another: and let us ask, as you have bidden us, that we may have God
and Christ and the angels as supporters in all our actions. We bid you, lord and brother,
ever heartily farewell, and have us in mind. Greet all who are with you. All ours who are
with us love you, and greet you, and desire to see you.</p>

<p>The Reply to the Same of Lucius and the Rest of the Martyrs.
Argument.—The Argument of the Present Letter Is, in Substance, the Same as that
of the Preceding; And Therefore It is Not a Letter of Lucius the Roman Bishop,
But of Lucius the African Bishop and Martyr.</p>
<p>1. To Cyprian our brother and colleague, Lucius, and all the brethren who are with me
in the Lord, greeting. Your letter came to us, dearest brother, while we were exulting and
rejoicing in God that He had armed us for the struggle, and had made us by His condescension
conquerors in the battle; the letter, namely, which you sent to us by Herennianus the
sub-deacon, and Lucian, and Maximus, and Amantius the acolytes,3025 which when we read
we received a relaxation in our bonds, a solace in our affliction, and a support in our necessity;
and we were aroused and more strenuously animated to bear whatever more of punishment
might be awaiting us. For before our suffering we were called forth by you to glory, who
first afforded us guidance to confession of the name of Christ. We indeed, who follow the
footsteps of your confession, hope for an equal grace with you. For he who is first in the
race is first also for the reward; and you who first occupied the course thence have com
municated this to us from what you began, showing doubtless the undivided love wherewith
you have always loved us, so that we who had one Spirit in the bond of peace might have
the grace of your3026 prayers, and one crown of confession.</p>
<p>2. But in your case, dearest brother, to the crown of confession is added the reward of
your labours—an abundant measure which you shall receive from the Lord in the day of
retribution, who have by your letter presented yourself to us, as you manifested to us that
candid and blessed breast of yours which we have ever known, and in accordance with its
largeness have uttered praises to God with us, not as much as we deserve to hear, but as
much as you are able to utter. For with your words you have both adorned those things
which had been less instructed in us, and have strengthened us to the sustaining of those
sufferings which we bear,3027 as being certain of the heavenly rewards, and of the crown of
martyrdom, and of the kingdom of God, from the prophecy which, being filled with the
Holy Spirit, you have pledged to us in your letter. All this will happen, beloved, if you will
have us in mind in your prayers, which I trust you do even as we certainly do.</p>

Quirinus and from yourself, a sacrifice from every clean thing. Even as Noah offered to God,
and God was pleased with the sweet savour, and had respect unto his offering, so also may
He have respect unto yours, and may He be pleased to return to you the reward of this so
good work. But I beg that you will command the letter which we have written to Quirinus
to be sent forward. I bid you, dearest brother and earnestly desired, ever heartily farewell,
and remember us.3028 Greet all who are with you. Farewell.</p>

<p>Cyprian to Sergius, Rogatianus, and the Other Confessors in Prison.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Consoles Rogatianus and His Colleagues, the Confessors in Prison,
and Gives Them Courage by the Example of the Martyrs Rogatianus the Elder
and Felicissimus. The Letter Itself Indicates that It Was Written in Exile.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to Sergius and Rogatianus, and the rest of the confessors in the Lord, everlasting
health. I salute you, dearest and most blessed brethren, myself also desiring to enjoy
the sight of you, if the state in which I am placed would permit me to come to you. For what
could happen to me more desirable and more joyful than to be now close to you, that you
might embrace me with those hands, which, pure and innocent, and maintaining the faith
of the Lord, have rejected the profane obedience? What more pleasant and sublime than
now to kiss your lips, which with a glorious voice have confessed the Lord, to be looked
upon even in presence by your eyes, which, despising the world, have become worthy3031
of looking upon God? But since opportunity is not afforded me to share in this joy, I send
this letter in my stead to your ears and to your eyes, by which I congratulate and exhort you
that you persevere strongly and steadily in the confession of the heavenly glory; and having
entered on the way of the Lord’s condescension, that you go on in the strength of the Spirit,
to receive the crown, having the Lord as your protector and guide, who said, “Lo, I am with
you alway, even unto the end of the world.”3032 O blessed prison, which your presence has
enlightened! O blessed prison, which sends the men of God to heaven! O darkness, more
bright than the sun itself, and clearer than the light of this world, where now are placed
temples of God, and your members are to be sanctified by divine confessions!</p>
<p>2. Nor let anything now be revolved in your hearts and minds besides the divine precepts
and heavenly commands, with which the Holy Spirit has ever animated you to the endurance
of suffering. Let no one think of death, but of immortality; nor of temporary punishment,
but of eternal glory; since it is written, “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
saints;”3033 and again, “A broken spirit is a sacrifice to God: a contrite and humble heart
God doth not despise.”3034 And again, where the sacred Scripture speaks of the tortures
which consecrate God’s martyrs, and sanctify them in the very trial of suffering: “And if

they have suffered torments in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality; and
having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God proved them, and
found them worthy of Himself. As gold in the furnace hath He tried them, and received
them as a sacrifice of a burnt-offering, and in due time regard shall be had unto them. The
righteous shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They shall
judge the nations, and have dominion over the people; and their Lord shall reign for ever.”3035
When, therefore, you reflect that you shall judge and reign with Christ the Lord, you must
needs exult and tread under foot present sufferings, in the joy of what is to come; knowing
that from the beginning of the world it has been so appointed that righteousness should
suffer there in the conflict of the world, since in the beginning, even at the first, the righteous
Abel was slain, and thereafter all righteous men, and prophets, and apostles who were sent.
To all of whom the Lord also in Himself has appointed an example, teaching that none shall
attain to His kingdom but those who have followed Him in His own way, saying, “He that
loveth his life in this world shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it
unto life eternal.”3036 And again: “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
the soul: but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”3037 Paul
also exhorts us that we who desire to attain to the Lord’s promises ought to imitate the Lord
in all things. “We are,” says he, “the sons of God: but if sons, then heirs; heirs of God, and
joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.”
3038 Moreover, he added the comparison of the present time and of the future glory,
saying, “The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming
glory which shall be revealed in us.”3039 Of which brightness, when we consider the glory,
it behoves us to bear all afflictions and persecutions; because, although many are the afflictions
of the righteous, yet those are delivered from them all who trust in God.</p>
<p>3. Blessed women also, who are established with you in the same glory of confession,
who, maintaining the Lord’s faith, and braver than their sex, not only themselves are near
to the crown of glory, but have afforded an example to other women by their constancy!
And lest anything should be wanting to the glory of your number, that each sex and every
age also might be with you in honour, the divine condescension has also associated with
you boys3040 in a glorious confession; representing to us something of the same kind as
once did Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, the illustrious youths to whom, when shut up in the

furnace, the fires gave way, and the flames gave refreshment, the Lord being present with
them, and proving that against His confessors and martyrs the heat of hell could have no
power, but that they who trusted in God should always continue unhurt and safe in all
dangers. And I beg you to consider more carefully, in accordance with your religion, what
must have been the faith in these youths which could deserve such full acknowledgment
from the Lord. For, prepared for every fate, as we ought all to be, they say to the king, “O
king Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter; for our God whom
we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and He will deliver us out of
thine hand, O king! But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy
gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.”3041 Although they believed,
and, in accordance with their faith, knew that they might even be delivered from their present
punishment, they still would not boast of this, nor claim it for themselves, saying, “But if
not.” Lest the virtue of their confession should be less without the testimony of their suffering,
they added that God could do all things; but yet they would not trust in this, so as to wish
to be delivered at the moment; but they thought on that glory of eternal liberty and security.</p>
<p>4. And you also, retaining this faith, and meditating day and night, with your whole
heart prepared for God, think of the future only, with contempt for the present, that you
may be able to come to the fruit of the eternal kingdom, and to the embrace and kiss, and
the sight of the Lord, that you may follow in all things Rogatianus the presbyter, the glorious
old man who, to the glory of our time, makes a way for you by his religious courage and
divine condescension, who, with Felicissimus our brother, ever quiet and temperate, receiving
the attack of a ferocious people, first prepared for you a dwelling in the prison, and, marking
out the way3042 for you in some measure, now also goes before you. That this may be consummated
in you, we beseech the Lord in constant prayers, that from beginnings going on
to the highest results, He may cause those whom He has made to confess, also to be crowned.
I bid you, dearest and most beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell in the Lord; and may
you attain to the crown of heavenly glory. Victor the deacon, and those who are with me,
greet you.</p>

immediately, dearest brother, was that all the clergy, being placed in the very heat of the
contest, were unable in any way to depart hence, all of them being prepared in accordance
with the devotion of their mind for divine and heavenly glory. But know that those have
come whom I had sent to the City3045 for this purpose, that they might find out and bring
back to us the truth, in whatever manner it had been decreed respecting us. For many various
and uncertain things are current in men’s opinions. But the truth concerning them is as
follows, that Valerian had sent a rescript to the Senate, to the effect that bishops and presbyters
and deacons should immediately be punished; but that senators, and men of importance,
and Roman knights,3046 should lose their dignity, and moreover be deprived of their property;
and if, when their means were taken away, they should persist in being Christians, then they
should also lose their heads; but that matrons should be deprived of their property, and sent
into banishment. Moreover, people of Cæsar’s household, whoever of them had either
confessed before, or should now confess, should have their property confiscated, and should
be sent in chains by assignment to Cæsar’s estates. The Emperor Valerian also added to this
address a copy of the letters which he sent to the presidents of the provinces concerning us;
which letters we are daily hoping will come, waiting according to the strength of our faith
for the endurance of suffering, and expecting from the help and mercy of the Lord the crown
of eternal life. But know that Xistus was martyred in the cemetery on the eighth day of the
Ides of August, and with him four deacons.3047 Moreover, the prefects in the City3048 are

<head>Epistle LXXXII.3050</head>
<p>To the Clergy and People Concerning His Retirement, a Little Before His Martyrdom.</p>
<p>Argument.—When, Near the End of His Life, Cyprian, on Returning to His Gardens,
Was Told that Messengers Were Sent to Take Him for Punishment to Utica, He
Withdrew. And Lest It Should Be Thought that He Had Done So from Fear of
Death, He Gives the Reason in This Letter, Viz., that He Might Undergo His
Martyrdom Nowhere Else Than at Carthage, in the Sight of His Own People.
a.d. 258.</p>
<p>1. Cyprian to the presbyters and deacons, and all the people, greeting. When it had been
told to us, dearest brethren, that the gaolers3051 had been sent to bring me to Utica, and I
had been persuaded by the counsel of those dearest to me to withdraw for a time from my
gardens, as a just reason was afforded I consented. For the reason that it is fit for a bishop,
in that city in which he presides over the Church of the Lord, there to confess the Lord, and
that the whole people should be glorified by the confession of their prelate in their presence.
For whatever, in that moment of confession, the confessor-bishop speaks, he speaks in the
mouth of all, by inspiration of God.3052 But the honour of our Church, glorious as it is, will
be mutilated if I, a bishop placed over another church, receiving my sentence or my confession
at Utica, should go thence as a martyr to the Lord, when indeed, both for my own sake
and yours, I pray with continual supplications, and with all my desires entreat, that I may
confess among you, and there suffer, and thence depart to the Lord even as I ought. Therefore
here in a hidden retreat I await the arrival of the proconsul returning to Carthage, that I
may hear from him what the emperors have commanded upon the subject of Christian
laymen and bishops, and may say what the Lord will wish to be said at that hour.</p>
<p>2. But do you, dearest brethren, according to the discipline which you have ever received
from me out of the Lord’s commands, and according to what you have so very often learnt
from my discourse, keep peace and tranquillity; nor let any of you stir up any tumult for
the brethren, or voluntarily offer himself to the Gentiles. For when apprehended and delivered
up, he ought to speak, inasmuch as the Lord abiding in us speaks in that hour, who willed

that we should rather confess than profess. But for the rest, what it is fitting that we should
observe before the proconsul passes sentence on me for the confession of the name of God,
we will with the instruction of the Lord arrange in common.3053 May our Lord make you,
dearest brethren, to remain safe in His Church, and condescend to keep you. So be it through
His mercy.</p>

<p>I.
(The presbyterate and the priesthood, p. 268.)</p>
<p>Here is an instance of a usage just becoming common to the East and West,—to give
the name of priesthood to the chief ministry as distinguished from the presbyterate. So in
Chrysostom passim, but notably in his treatise περὶ ἱερωσύνης. The scriptural warrant for
this usage is derived, dialectically, from the universal priesthood of Christians (1 Pet. ii. 5),
from the Old-Testament prophecies of the Christian ministry (Isa. lxvi. 21), and from the
culmination of the sacerdotium in the chief ministry of St. Paul. Over and against the Mosaic
priesthood he is supposed to assert his own priestly charisma in the Epistle to the Romans,3054
where he says, “I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus” (i.e., the Great High Priest),
“in things pertaining to God;” that is (according to the Heb. v. 1), “as a high priest taken
from among men, in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for
sins.” He asserts himself, therefore, as a better priest than those of the Law, “because of the
grace that was given me of God, that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles,
ministering in sacrifice3055 the Gospel of God.” He then (according to this theory) adopts
the language and the idea of Malachi, and adds, “that the oblation of the Gentiles might be
acceptable,” etc.; i.e., the pure ninchah, or oblation of bread and wine, commemorative of
the one “and only propitiatory sacrifice of Calvary.”</p>
<p>These ideas run through all the primitive liturgies,3056 which we are soon to reach in
this series. It is no part of my plan to vindicate them, but only to state them. It will be felt
by many that these were at least exaggerated views of the apostle’s ministry,—of the principle
underlying his phrase, εἰς τὸ εἶναί με λειτουργὸν…ἱερουργοῦντα τὸ ἐυαγγέλιον ; but let
nobody read into these primitive expressions concerning a commemoration of the one only
propitiatory sacrifice “once offered,” the monstrous doctrine of the Council of Trent, which,
reduced to its mildest form,3057 is as follows: “The sacrifice of the Mass is, and ought to be
considered, one and the same sacrifice with that of the Cross…which being the case, it must
be taught, without any hesitation, that (as the holy Council of Trent hath moreover explained)
the sacred and holy sacrifice of the Mass is not only a sacrifice of praise and eucharist, or a

<pb n="977"/>
mere commemoration of the sacrifice effected on the Cross, but also truly a propitiatory
sacrifice, by which God is appeased, and rendered propitious to us.” That such was not the
doctrine of the Latin churches, even in the ninth century, sufficiently appears from the
treatise of Ratramn; but it is not less apparent from the ancient liturgies themselves, and
even from many primitive features which glitter like gold-dust amid the dross of the Roman
missal itself.</p>

<p>II.
(To do nothing on my own private opinion, p. 283.)</p>
<p>Note this golden principle which runs through all the epistles and treatises of our largeminded
and free-spirited author, “A primordio episcopatus mei statuerim nihil, sine consilio
vestro, et sine consensu plebis meæprivata sententia gerere.” When, in the midst of persecution,
he could not convoke his council, he apologizes, as will appear hereafter,3058 even for
taking measures requisite to the emergency without such counsel. Such was his duty according
to the primitive discipline, no doubt; but our author knew well that a relaxing of discipline
in exceptional circumstances is the fruitful source of corruption. He is jealous against himself:—
<lg>
<l>“Twill be recorded for a precedent;</l>
<l>And many an error, by the same example</l>
<l>Will rush into the Church.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>It is instructive to find the views of Baxter harmonizing with those of Cyprian. He speaks
for himself and his brethren as not opposed to episcopacy, but only to “the engrossing (by
prelates) of the sole power of ordination and jurisdiction…excluding wholly the pastors of
particular churches from all share in it.” This is a sound Cyprianic remonstrance;3059 but
Cyprian always includes the plebs as well as the “pastors.” In short, if Ignatius, his Gamaliel,
teaches primarily, “Do nothing without the bishop,” he not less reiterates his own maxim,
“Let bishops do nothing without the presbytery and the people.”</p>
<p>Here it must be noted, however, that the primitive Fathers never speak of the episcopate
as a development of the presbyterate, as do the Middle-Age writers and the schoolmen. It
was the policy of these to write down the bishops to mere presbyters, for the purpose of exalting
the papacy, which they made the only episcopate and the universal apostolate. The
Universal Bishop might, then, appoint presbyters to be his local vicars, and to bear a titular
episcopate, as such,—the name of an office, and not an order. The episcopate was no longer,

be found in Leighton’s Works, p. 637 Edinburgh, 1840.</note>

<pb n="978"/>
as with Ignatius and Cyprian, the apostolic office from which the presbyterate and diaconate
were precipitated, but, rather, an ecclesiastical sublimate of the presbyterate. By this theory
no bishop in the Latin communion can deal with the Bishop of Rome as Cyprian did,—on
terms of equality, and as a co-bishop or colleague in a common episcopate. Such is the school
doctrine: and the Council of Trent made it dogma, abolishing the order of bishops as such,
and defining that there are only three Holy Orders; viz., presbyters, deacons, and sub-deacons.
3060 The order of bishops is thus reduced to a merely ecclesiastical order in “the hierarchy,”
a vicariate of the papacy.</p>

<p>III.
(According to the Lord’s discipline, p. 292.)</p>
<p>Here he lays down, as a divine constitution for the Church, the principle exemplified
in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts xv. 4–6, 22, 23). Compare Epistle xiv., where he speaks of
some presbyters and deacons as “too little mindful of discipline,” and of his instructions to
the laity to maintain the same. Observe his language in the exceptional case referred to in
the previous elucidation. “In ordinations of the clergy, beloved brethren” (he writes to
“presbyters, deacons, and the whole people”), “we usually consult you beforehand, and weigh
(the matter) with the general advice.”</p>
<p>It is surprising that the learned and pious Dr. Pusey, always influenced by his essential
Gallicanism, and too little devoted to the primitive discipline, hastily committed himself, in
his work on The Councils of the Church, to an erroneous statement of the historic facts3061
as to the participation of the laity in synods. In reply, that American Cyprian, Whittingham
of Maryland, called the Doctor’s attention to an example he had evidently overlooked, in
words worthy of note from so profound a patristic scholar. He says, “It occurred in the
middle of the period to which Dr. Pusey’s book is limited, and, as nearly as can be known,
during the episcopate of Cyprian.” He adds, “I doubt whether there is another equally particular
relation of the circumstances of an episcopal election within the first four centuries.”
It is given in the life of Gregory Thaumaturgus, by his namesake Gregory of Nyssa.3062 The
whole of Bishop Whittingham’s searching reviewal3063 of Dr. Pusey’s positions is an honour
to American scholarship, and ought to be consulted by the student of primitive antiquity.</p>

(Common consultation, p. 294.)</p>
<p>Again, we have our author’s testimony to the free spirit of primitive councils, in which
I exult as a Christian believer, and as a loyal supporter of constitutional liberty, i.e., freedom
regulated by law. Concerning which, note the saying of Franklin, note 9, vol. i. p. 552, of
this series. To primitive discipline and to these free councils of the Cyprianic age the world
is indebted for all its free constitutions; and when narrow-minded men presume to assert
the contrary, because of mediæval feudalism in the West, let them be reminded that not till
the Church’s constitutions were superseded by the forged Decretals, was the Western Church
so deprived of its freedom as to be made the tool of despotism in violating the liberty of
Christians. The last council of the whole West that retained anything of the primitive spirit
was that of Frankfort, a.d. 794: but its spirit survived, and not infrequently asserted itself in
“the Gallican maxims,” so called; while in England it was never smothered, but always survived
in the parliaments until the usurpations of the papacy were abolished in the Church
and realm. This was done by a practical re-assertion of Cyprianic principles. It is well to remind
such reckless critics as Draper and Lecky that the Christian Church is responsible only for
her own Catholic legislation; not at all for what has been done under the fraudulent pretexts
of the Decretals, in defiance of her whole system, which is embodied in the Ante-Nicene
Fathers and the Nicene Constitutions.</p>

<p>V.
(Counsel and judgment of all…a common cause, p. 296.)</p>
<p>The language here is indicative of the whole spirit of Catholic canons, to which that of
the Latin canonists affords such a contrast after the Isidorian forgeries had been made, by
Nicholas, the system of the West. Note the words which our author addresses to his clergy,
omni plebe adstante: “Quæ res cum omnium nostrum consilium et sententiam spectet,
præjudicare ego, et soli mihi rem communem vindicare, non audeo.” In other words, “What
concerns all, ought by all to be considered and decided.”3064</p>
<p>The fifteenth chapter of Bishop Wordsworth’s History of the Church (vol. i.) deals with
the ante-Nicene councils, and expounds their spirit and organization in a very able and
concise manner.</p>

<p>VI.
(Let us pray for the lapsed, p. 310.)</p>
<note type="footnote">3064 Consult Epistles xxv. (sec. 6, p. 304) and xxx. (sec. 5, p. 310), supra. It is interesting to note how the
primitive clergy of Rome recognise this free principle, with no suspicion that their own cathedra is not only
their sufficient resource, but the oracle of God to all mankind.</note>

<pb n="980"/>
<p>The passage that follows seems to be a quotation from the common prayers then in use.
Out of these “bidding prayers” grew the ancient litanies; the deacon dictating the suffrage,
and the people responding with the petition, “Lord, have mercy upon them,” or the like.</p>
<p>By arranging the petitions thus,—
<lg>
<l>Pro lapsis oremus ut erigantur;</l>
<l>Pro stantibus ut non tententur, etc.,</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>we shall see how such prayers were formulated, and how the people, by responding
Amen to each suffrage, gave their common supplications accordingly. These suffrages might
be enlarged indefinitely, as divers subjects for prayer were presented; and so there was a
mingling of what has been called “free prayer” with the liturgical system, without confusion
or lack of harmony.</p>

<p>VII.
(The honour of our colleague, p. 319.)</p>
<p>Thus Cyprian speaks of the Bishop of Rome, whose due ordination and rightful jurisdiction
Novatian was impugning. The absurdity of calling this heretic Novatian an antipope
involves a great confusion of ideas, however. For, as Cornelius was no more a pope
than Cyprian (to both of whom the title was freely conceded in its primitive sense3065, how
can it be proper to give Novatian a name which implies a mediæval sense, and leads the
student to infer that his claim was not merely to the See of Rome,3066 but to a universal
bishopric over all Christians? It is needless to say, that, had the churches so understood the
case, the whole Christian world would have been convulsed by a matter which, in point of
fact, was soon settled by Cyprian’s enforcement of the canons. See subsequent letters.</p>

<p>VIII.
(Novatian, pp. 319, 324.)</p>
<p>The similarity of the names of Novatus and Novatian, and their complicity in a common
schism, led to great confusions among their contemporaries, which have not been wholly
cleared even to this day. See Lardner’s elaborate argument against the latter name as a mere
blunder. He calls Novatian also Novatus, and gives his forcible reasons.
Observe that “ordination” is the term here used for conferring the order of bishops on
a presbyter. So always anciently, though now it is customary to speak only of the “consecra-
<note type="footnote">3065 See Elucidation III. p. 154, supra.</note>
<note type="footnote">3066 Cyprian facetiously remarks (see Ep. xlviii. p. 325) that Novatus reserved his greater crimes for the
greater city; “since Rome, from her magnitude, ought to take precedence of Carthage.”</note>

<pb n="981"/>
tion” of a bishop. This is the inferior term; for the bishop is supposed to be “consecrated”
to his specialty or diocese, while he is raised by “ordination” to the order in which all bishops
are equal. Mirabeau says, “Words are things.” I quote from a political source the following
remarks of a shrewd observer of Mirabeau’s principle. Speaking of American phraseology
in constitutional affairs, he says, “It is true that this is a mere matter of words or phrases, but
words and phrases misused have a very potent influence for confusing the minds of men as
to real things. In politics, as in theology, it is best to stick to the text, and to avoid supposedly
equivalent phrases. Such phrases often contain within them the seeds of heresy and schism.”
Now, it was the policy of the schoolmen to confuse terms, in order to break down the Cyprianic
theory; and they denied that bishops were ordained to a “Holy Order.” Theirs was
only a name of office; and their order was only an ecclesiastical order, as much so as “sacristans.”
3067 This to keep them from Cyprian’s claim of equality with the Bishop of Rome.
But this was debatable school doctrine only, till the Council of Trent. Since that, it has been
dogma in the Roman communion. Contrast, therefore, the Greek and (modern) Roman
dogmas:—</p>
<p>1. Greek.3068 “The three orders, by divine institution, are, (1) the episcopate, (2) the
priesthood, (3) the diaconate.”</p>
<p>2. Roman.3069 “According to the uniform tradition3070 of the Catholic Church, the
number of these orders is seven; and they are called (1) porter, (2) reader, (3) exorcist, (4)
acolyte, (5) sub-deacon, (6) deacon, (7) priest.” The “bishop,” then, is only a priest, who acts
as vicar for the one “Universal Bishop” at Rome. For the Greek theory, note Cyprian passim.</p>

<p>IX.
(Cornelius, our colleague, p. 328.)</p>
<p>Observe the state of the case. “Lest perchance the number of bishops in Africa should
seem unsatisfactory,” etc., he wrote to his colleague in Rome, who gathered a council also,
“with very many bishops.” Imagine such language, and such action in any case, between the
French metropolitan and the present Bishop of Rome! The contrast illustrates the absolute
nonentity, in the Cyprianic age, of any conception of such relations as now exist between
Rome and her vassal episcopate. “Prostrate at the feet of your Holiness,” etc.: the noblest
bishops and the boldest at the Vatican Council thus signed their feeble and abject remonstrances.
Among their names are Schwarzenberg, Furstenberg, and even Strossmayer.3071</p>

<p>X.
(One episcopate diffused, p. 333.)</p>
<p>Here is the principle expounded in the Treatise on Unity. He states it tersely as follows:—
“Episcopatus unus, episcoporum multorum concordi numerositate diffusus.”</p>
<p>And he then states in few words his theory of the “compact unity of the Catholic Church,”
in which the existence of the “provinces” is recognised, and an “ecclesiastical structure;” but
not a hint of what must have been laid down as the test and primal law of truth and unity,
had any infallible supremacy been imagined to exist. In that case, no need of a treatise, no
need of words: he would have said nothing of “co-bishops,” but simply of communion with
the Bishop of Rome.</p>

<p>XI.
(Fabian and Donatus, also our predecessors, p. 342.)</p>
<p>Here the Paris editors of a.d. 1574 take pains to remind us that Cyprian means “Fabian,
your predecessor, and Donatus, mine.” Very well. But the implication is that “our predecessors”
were persons of the same office and dignity. Let us suppose the present Bishop of
Alger writing to Leo XIII. in the same manner, as follows: “Bishop Strossmayer was severely
remarked upon by Pius and Martial, our predecessors, in their letters.” Would this be tolerated?
The editor of this series answered the invitation of Pius IX. to his council in 1869, after
the manner of a contemporary of Cyprian,3072 in order to make the contrast between the
third century and the nineteenth palpable to the venerable pontiff and his adviser Antonelli.
It was resented with animosity by the Ultramontane journals, on the ground that nobody
on earth should address the pontiff as bishop to bishop, or as man to man.</p>

<p>XII.
(To whom perfidy could have no access, p. 344.)</p>
<p>When we put a man in mind of his self-respect, we imply that he is in peril of forgetting
the quality we impute to him. “You are a gentleman, and, of course, cannot deceive me:”
such language is not complimentary, but involves a gentle reproof. So here our author has
to remind the Roman clergy of what is due to themselves if they would keep up the credit
assigned to them by St. Paul, but from which, as the apostle himself warned them, they were
in danger of falling. Cyprian goes on to remind them of what they owe to Carthage and its
<note type="footnote">3072 A Letter to Pius the Ninth, Bishop of Rome, etc., published by Parker, London, 1870. It also appeared in
most of the languages of Europe, and was circulated by the Greeks in their own tongue.</note>

<pb n="983"/>
synods, and warns them against “abandoned men” seeking to discredit the African bishops.
3073 The Roman clergy had already confessed their sense of what was due to Carthage,3074
and in another epistle,3075 doubtless remembering Zephyrinus and Callistus, they confess
their degeneracy, and the ignominy of their actual position as compared with that which
the apostle had praised. The passage is often quoted as if it read, “to whom corrupt faith can
have no access:” but the word is perfidia, and has reference, not to faith, but morals; and, to
avoid ambiguity, I have put the word “perfidy” into the translation, where the Edinburgh
translator has “faithlessness.”</p>
<p>Here note (p. 346, note 2) the reference to St. Paul’s term (κατατομὴ), the concision,
where the Oxford note (p. 170, Oxford trans.) is to the point. Only let it be more clearly
stated, that St. Paul calls the Judaizing schismatics the κατατομὴ; meaning that, instead of
the circumcised body, they are but the particula præputii cut off and cast away. Our author
uses it here with great effect, therefore. In another place3076 St. Paul carries his scornful
anathema farther, with a witty reference to a heathen example; on which see Canon Farrar
in his St. Paul, cap. xxii. (Agdistis) p. 235, ed. New York. The “sport with children,” in the
Canon’s note (p. 227), seems to me illustrated by Exod. iv. 24–26. Trifling with children,
i.e., their salvation.</p>

<p>XIII.
(I both warn and ask you, p. 346 at note 4.)</p>
<p>The original is, “admoneo et peto;” the language of an equal, but yet of an older brother
in the episcopate. Here some other points are worthy to be noted in this important letter,
and they shall be briefly taken in serie.</p>
<p>1. We here encounter the tangled knot of the triple schisms, in which the unhappy Felicissimus,
with Novatus and Novatian, has long presented a scandal to criticism. Thus, our
author speaks of Felicissimus as “schismatis et disidii auctor;” and difficulties have been
raised about the meaning of the text, because Novatus would rather seem entitled to that
“bad eminence.” I think all difficulty disappears if we drop the idea that a particular schism
is here referred to, and understand merely that this bad man was “the beginner of schism
and dissension,” out of which the three specific schisms had cropped. Go back to Epistles
xxxvii. (p. 315) and xxxviii. (p. 316) and xxxix. (p. 319) for his antecedents. The “faction of

Felicissimus” (sec. 2), and of “five presbyters” with him (sec. 3), is here sufficiently evident
to illustrate the point now under consideration. In Epistle xlviii. (p. 325) we find Novatus,
it is true, accused as “the first sower of discord and sedition,” but in another sense, because
Felicissimus was a mere layman. Novatus took him up, and had him unlawfully ordained
a deacon; and now Felicissimus becomes a mere appendage, and Novatus becomes formidable.
Sailing to Italy, and coming to Rome just in time to inspire the discontent of Novatian
with a wicked ambition, he next proceeds to engineer his schismatical ordination to the
bishopric of Rome by the hands of three bishops, acting uncanonically and sinfully. So now
Novatian becomes the chief character as rival to Cornelius, and pretender to his See; while
Novatus returns to Africa to foment new disturbances, but is justly excommunicated, and
disappears from history.</p>
<p>2. In this epistle it would seem that Cornelius had vacillated weakly, and was in peril of
acting uncanonically. Cyprian gently admonishes him (sec. 2): “I was considerably surprised,”
etc.; also (sec. 6), “I speak to you as being provoked, as grieving, as constrained,” etc.</p>
<p>3. Here Fortunatus appears on the scene, to embroil the matter yet more seriously; of
whom (sec. 9) enough appears in this letter.</p>
<p>4. Fortunatus, with his wicked allies, sails to Rome (sec. 11) as the nearest apostolic See,
hence spoken of (sec. 14) as the chief church (i.e., of the West) and the matrix of unity (i.e.,
to the daughter churches of Africa). Let us read into the pages of Cyprian no Decretalist
ideas when he modestly acknowledges the comparative inferiority of his place. Let us find
his meaning in this very letter, and others, in which his words contradict all ideas of any
official inferiority. Take also the ideas of the epoch for illustration. Recur to Cyprian’s
master expounding the relations of the primitive churches, one to another, in his Prescription.
Tertullian points out a root-principle in all apostolic Sees;3077 and then, after elaborate
discussion, he thus applies it practically:—</p>
<p>“Run over the apostolic churches, in which the very thrones of the apostles,” etc. “Achaia,
e.g., is proximate to you; then there is Corinth. If you are near Macedonia, there is Philippi.…
Crossing to Asia, you get Ephesus.…Close to Italy you have Rome, from which comes
to us (in Africa) our authority,” etc. I abridge, but do not alter the sense.3078 Here, then, we
find what Cyprian was writing about. The schismatics, on this principle, had rushed to the
nearest apostolic See, viz., that of the Imperial City. Cyprian recognises his claims on its
bishop; Rome being the source of his own ordination, and the matrix of the Carthaginian
church. This animates him with a loving humility. But what next? Having expressed all this,
he proceeds, as an equal but an elder brother, to assert his rights, and to admonish Cornelius
<note type="footnote">3077 Cap. xx. p. 252, note 7, etc. See vol. iii., this series.</note>
<note type="footnote">3078 Vol. iii. p. 260, cap, xxxvi. and note 13.</note>

<pb n="985"/>
that he, too, must obey the ecclesiastical discipline. Nobody, even among the Greeks, would
object to such a Roman primacy, even at this day; but “to give place by subjection, even for
an hour,” is what St. Cyprian would not endure any more than St. Paul.3079 “Supremacy”
is another thing.</p>
<p>5. The grounds of his conduct in this and other acts are unfolded in his Treatise on
Unity. But here is the place to show what Cyprian had in his mind as the ἄρχαῖα ἔθη. A
canon3080 of the African church, after providing for local appeals, reads as follows: “Let
them not appeal to tribunals beyond the seas, but to the primates of their own provinces, or
to a general council, as hath been often ordained with respect to bishops. But whoso shall
persevere in appealing to tribunals beyond seas, let them be received to communion by no
one in Africa.” And here note that the plural is used, illustrating the above quotation from
Tertullian. All the apostolic Sees are treated alike, as “tribunals beyond seas.” Note, also,
that if any one of these tribunals should receive and hear the appellant, its decisions were
of no force in Africa.</p>
<p>6. And, still further, let it be noted that the greatness of Rome, as the capital, was its only
ground, even to a canonical primacy afterwards conceded to it for the sake of order. The
Council of Chalcedon (Fourth OEcumenical, a.d. 451) states the case, and sets the historical
fact beyond dispute, as follows: “The Fathers rightly granted the seniority (ἀποδεδώκασι τὰ
πρεσβεῖα), because that city was the capital, to the throne of the elder Rome,…and equal
precedency (τὰ ἶσα πρεσβεῖα) to the most holy throne of New Rome (Constantinople); justly
judging that the city which is dignified with the sovereignty and the senate, and enjoys equal
privileges with the elder imperial Rome, should likewise be magnified with the other in ecclesiastical
affairs, and rank second after that See.” Second as to order, that is; but equal as
to this presbeia.</p>
<p>Cyprian’s theory shows why they said nothing of its apostolic dignity; viz., because in
that respect all apostolic Sees were equal, and all older than Rome, and because all other
churches in communion with these centres were practically apostolic, and each was a See
of Peter. For, as Cyprian expounds it, there is but one episcopate; and each bishop, locally,
possesses the whole of it. It was given first to Peter to make this principle emphatic; i.e., it
is a gift held whole and entire by each holder. Then he gave the same to all the apostles, that
each one of them might comprehend that what St. Peter had, he had: it was an undivided
and indivisible authority. “Each particular church,” says the Oxford translator, “being the
miniature of the whole, each bishop the representative of Christ, the Chief Bishop; so that,
all bishops being, in their several stations, one and the same (as representing the Same),
there was, as it were, but one bishop.” Such was Cyprian’s exposition of the ἀρχαῖα ἔθη: I

<pb n="986"/>
am not so forgetful as to introduce anything of my own. But here it is to be noted that the
theory of the Decretals was subversive of all this: there was but one, personally, the representative
of Christ, His3081 Vicar; and his See, by divine warrant, was supreme. Hence others,
called bishops, were not such, as being equals with the Bishop of Rome in the episcopal order,
for their “order” was only that of presbyters; and they were called “bishops” only as vicars
of the one Bishop at Rome, empowered to act for him in local stations, but having no real
episcopate in themselves. Now, Calvin’s memorable sentence was based on this difference
between the primitive bishops and those of his day. With his strong logic he argued: if, then,
bishops are but shadows of a papacy which we have proved fabulous, bishops must be rejected
as part of the papacy. But, he said, “Talem nobis hierarchiam si exhibeant, in qua sic emineant
episcopi ut Christo subesse non recusent, et ab illo, tanquam unico capite, pendeant et ad
ipsum referantur; in qua, sic inter se fraternam societatem colant ut non alio nodo, quam
ejus veritate sint colligati; tum vero nullo non anathemate dignos fatear, si qui erunt, qui
non eam reverenter, summaque obedientia, observent.”</p>
<p>It would seem, therefore, that Calvin drew a correct distinction between the Cyprianic
theory and that of the Decretists. “A Christo, unico capite, pendeant,” touches the point of
the Western schism, which altered this principle into “A pontifice Romano, unico capite,”
prorsus pendeant omnes præsules Catholici.</p>

<p>XIV.
(The bishop should be chosen in the presence of the people, p. 371.)</p>
<p>Concerning the election of bishops, and the part of the laity therein, enough has been
already said to elucidate this important historical point.3082 But here is the place to elucidate
Cyprian’s relations to Ignatius, by pointing out his theory as to “bishops, presbyters, and
deacons.” The inquiry is, not whether his theory was right or wrong; but the ante-Nicene
Constitutions and Canons cannot be understood without a clear comprehension of it, and
it is practically important in the coming collisions with the alien religion now lifting its head
aggressively amongst us. To refute its pretensions, Cyprian and Hippolytus are sufficient if
cleared from all ambiguities thrown back into their expressions from the mediæval corruption
of primitive words, idioms, and modes of thought.</p>
<p>As to presbyters and deacons, then, we must refer to pp. 306, 366, 370; sub-deacons are
mentioned pp. 301 and 306, with lectors under “teaching-presbyters,” as preparing for the
clerical office. On p. 306 an acolyte is mentioned. Now, these readers, sub-deacons, and
acolytes (ἀκόλουθος ) are all of a class,—persons preparing for Holy Orders, and after a
<note type="footnote">3081 Calvin, De necessitate reformanda ecclesiæ, Works, vol. viii. p. 60. Amstelodami, 1667.</note>

<pb n="987"/>
time known as in “ecclesiastical” or minor orders.3083 The lectors need not be explained.
The sub-deacons are a class not heard of till this third century, even in the West. Cyprian
and Cornelius are the first to mention them. In the East, sub-deacons and acolytes first appear
in the fourth century; they were sub-ministrants and attendants on the clergy, and doubtless
had charge of the very troublesome work of preparing the candidates for immersion, and
the waters for that sacrament, besides cleansing the fonts, and superintending the changes
of raiment made necessary. Their offices in time of divine service, attending upon the altar,
taking the offerings, seating the congregation, watching the children, etc., may be supposed.
Apart from the names, just such offices, like those of sextons, are required in all public
worship. The Moravians have acolyths, to this day.</p>

<p>XV.
(Cornelius…a peaceable and righteous priest, etc., p. 371.)</p>
<p>Now observe his parting tribute in these words, “Cornelius, our colleague, a peaceable
and righteous priest, and moreover honoured by the condescension of the Lord with martyrdom,
has long ago decreed, with us and with all the bishops appointed throughout the
whole world,” etc. A colleague, sharing in the decrees of his co-bishops throughout the whole
world, is the recognised position of this successor of St. Peter. And Cyprian, who firmly
believes that St. Peter, as “a source and principle of unity,” had the personal honour of being
the first foundation-stone laid on the Corner-Stone Himself, sees nothing in that to make
Cornelius the foundation; nor did Cornelius himself. No, nor St. Peter either, who says (1
Pet. ii. 5) all Christians may become Peters by being laid on the Living Stone, Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Thus we are prepared to read the Treatise on Unity. We may also concede to the bishops
of Rome, even now, that as soon as they claim no more than Cornelius and St. Peter himself
did, their primacy will no longer be a stumbling-block and a schism to the Christian universe.</p>
<p>In parting with Cornelius, it is useful to note that he represents his diocese in his day3084
as numbering “forty-six presbyters, seven deacons and the same number of sub-deacons,
with forty-two acolytes and exorcists, readers and sacristans in all fifty-two.” More than
“fifteen hundred widows and sufferers” dependent on this comparatively small and poor
church show the terrible ravages made by persecution.</p>

<p>We now reach a very different character from that of his predecessor; and in him we
encounter the germinant spirit which, in long after-ages, was able to overcome the discipline
of the Church.3085 At this time, and during the great synodical period, these personal caprices
were made light of: the canons and constitutions of the Church were strong enough to check
them; and such was the predominance of the Eastern mind, for many generations, that the
ship of the Church was not thrown out of trim. Let us carefully note this historical point,
however, and the spirit in which our great author exposes the elements of error.</p>

<p>XVII.
(In the name of, etc. Since Three are One, pp. 380, 382.)</p>
<p>Having elsewhere touched upon the quotation attributed to Tertullian,3086 I need not
repeat what has been said of this once very painfully agitated matter. But, as to the quotations
of the African Fathers generally, it ought to be understood that there was a vetus Italabefore
Jerome,—more than one, no doubt,—to which that Father was largely indebted for the text
now called the Vulgate. Vercellone assured Dean Burgon that there was indeed one established
Latin text,3087 an old Itala.</p>
<p>Scrivener3088 says candidly, “It is hard to believe that 1 John v. 7 was not cited by Cyprian;”
and again, “The African writers Vigilius of Thapsus (at the end of the fifth century)
and Fulgentius (circa 520) in two places expressly appeal to the three heavenly Witnesses.”
So, too, Victor Vitensis, in the notable case of the African king of the Vandals. The admission
of Tischendorf is also cited by Scrivener. Tischendorf says, “Gravissimus est Cyprianus (in
Tract. de Eccles. Unitate), Dicit Dominus, Ego et Pater unum sumus (Joann. x. 30); et, iterum,
de Patre, Filio, et Spiritu Sancto, scriptum est, Et tres unum sunt.” Tischendorf adds the
testimony of this epistle to Jubaianus. And Scrivener decides that “it is surely safer and more
candid to admit that Cyprian read it in his copies, than to resort to,” etc., the usual explainings
away. To this note of this same erudite scholar the reader may also turn for satisfaction as
to the reasons against authenticity. But primarily, to meet questions as to versions used by
Cyprian, let him consult the same invaluable work (p. 269) on the Old Latin before Jerome.
I have added an important consideration in a note to the Anonymous Treatise on Baptism,
which follows (infra), with other documents, in our Appendix.3089</p>

(Return to our Lord and Origin, p. 389.)</p>
<p>Here is an appeal to the ἀρχαῖα ἔθη, that explains other references to “the Root and
Origin,” which he here identifies with our Lord,3090 and “the evangelical and apostolic tradition.”
This was the understanding at Nicæa: “ut si in aliquo nutaverit et vacillaverit veritas,
ad originem dominicam et evangelicam et apostolicam traditionem revertamur.” Is not this
the grand catholicon for the disorders of modern Christendom? “Nam consuetudo, sine
veritate, vetustas erroris est,” says Cyprian in this very Epistle.3091 And, “If we return to the
head and source of divine tradition, human error ceases.”</p>

<p>XIX.
(Firmilianus to Cyprian, p. 390.)</p>
<p>The contest with Stephen, bishop of Rome, will require no great amount of annotation
here, chiefly because the matter has no practical bearings, except as it incidentally proves
what was the relation of Stephen to other bishops and to the Catholic Church. In this letter
(sec. 6) Firmilian accuses Stephen of “daring to make a departure from the peace and unity
of the Catholic Church.” And (in sec. 16), further, he sets forth, for the Easterns, the same
theory of unity which Cyprian had expounded for the West; viz., the unity of the episcopate.
He interprets the parallel texts (Matthew xvi. 19 and John xx. 22, 23) of bestowal in the same
manner. His idea is, that, had the latter bestowal been the only one, the apostles might have
felt that each had only a share in the same respectively; while, as it stands, there is one episcopate
only: in effect, only “one bishop;” each apostle and every bishop, by “vicarious ordination,”
holding for his flock in his own See all that Christ gave to Peter himself, save only
the personal privilege of a leader in opening the door to the Gentiles,3092 and in teaching
the apostles the full meaning of the gift. The point here is not whether this was the true
meaning of our Lord: it is merely that such was the understanding of the Ante-Nicene
Fathers.3093</p>
<p>Further (sec. 17), he complains of Stephen for his folly in assuming that he had received
some superior privileges as the successor of Peter; also censures him for “betraying and

deserting unity.” So (in sec. 25) he reflects on Stephen for “disagreeing with so many bishops
throughout the world…with the Eastern churches and with the South.” He adds, “with such
a man, can there be one spirit and one body?”</p>
<p>Firmilian was of Cappadocia, and a disciple of Origen. The interest of his letter turns
upon its entire innocence of any conception that Stephen has a right to dictate; and, while
it shows a dangerous tendency in the latter personally to take airs upon himself as succeeding
the primate of the apostolic college, it proves not less that the Church was aware of no
ground for it, but held all bishops equally responsible for unity by communion with their
brethren. To make them thus responsible to him and his See had probably not even entered
Stephen’s head. He was rash and capricious in his resort to measures by which every bishop
felt bound to separate himself from complicity with open heretics, and he seems to have
had local usage on his side. But how admirable the contrasted forbearance of Cyprian, whose
views were equally strong, but who protested against all coercive measures against others.</p>

<p>XX.
(Clinics, p. 401.)</p>
<p>Cyprian’s moderation is conspicuous in his views of clinic baptism; for, though Novatian
knew none other, he forbore to urge this irregularity against him. Even the good Cornelius
was not so forbearing.3094 St. Cyprian seems to be the earliest apologist for sprinkling. See
Wall, Reflections on Baptism of Infants (Wall’s Works), vol. iii. p. 219, for a refutation of
Tertullian’s supposed admission of “a little sprinkling.”3095 And see Beveridge on Trine

<p>XXI.
(Senators and men of importance and Roman knights, p. 408.)</p>
<p>1 Cor. i. 26. We have already seen tokens of the gradual enlightenment of the higher
classes in the empire; “the palace, senate, forum,” are mentioned by Tertullian.3096 The
fiercer persecutions seem now to be stimulated by this very fact, and a fear lest Christianity
should spread too freely among patricians must have prompted this decree.</p>

<p>The saying of Christ (Matt. x. 10; Mark xiii. 11), “It is not ye that speak, but the Holy
Ghost,” was literally accepted, and acted upon. Is it marvellous that it inspired believing
men to be martyrs, or that martyrs were so much venerated? And ought not the same texts
to be more faithfully accepted in explaining the inspiration of the Holy Scriptures? Language
could hardly be stronger: “It is not ye that speak.” So we reach the close of this holy and
heroic life of the great, the fervid, the intrepid, but, withal, the gentle and generous Cyprian.
And in these last words we see the spirit of the man cropping out in his proposal to “arrange
in common” with the clergy and people what should be observed, as requisite for the diocese
after his decease, according to “the instruction of the Lord.” Qui facit voluntatem Dei manet

the Carthaginians, Who Already Were Not Averse to Him, on Account of
Novatus and Some Other Presbyters of His Church, Who Had Originated the
Whole Disturbance, Cyprian Wrote This Treatise. And First of All, Fortifying
Them Against the Deceits of These, He Exhorts Them to Constancy, and Instructs
Them that Heresies Exist Because Christ, the Head of the Church, is Not Looked
To, that the Common Commission First Entrusted to Peter is Contemned, and
the One Church and the One Episcopate are Deserted. Then He Proves, as Well
by the Scriptures as by the Figures of the Old and New Testament, the Unity of
the Church.3098</p>

as his own, and gives the sense in which the primitive Christians understood these words of the Creed, “the

<note type="footnote">3098 Describing in few words the ambition and dissimulation of Novatian in invading the episcopate of Rome,
he argues at length, that neither on the one hand is the passage in Matthew xviii. of any avail to compensate for
their fewness as against the Church: “Wherever two or three are gathered together in my name,” etc.; nor, on
the other, could martyrdom be of any benefit to them outside the Church. Then he tells them that they need
not marvel that heresies flourished, since they had been foretold by Christ; nor that certain Roman confessors
acquiesced in the schism, because before one’s death no one is blessed, and the traitor Judas was found in the
very company of the apostles. Yet he charges them to shun the association of schismatics and heretics, and finally
exhorts them by the Scriptures to peace and unanimity.</note>

and to beware of the wiles of the crafty foe, that we, who have put on Christ the wisdom of
God the Father, may not seem to be wanting in wisdom in the matter of providing for our
salvation? For it is not persecution alone that is to be feared; nor those things which advance
by open attack to overwhelm and cast down the servants of God. Caution is more easy where
danger is manifest, and the mind is prepared beforehand for the contest when the adversary
avows himself. The enemy is more to be feared and to be guarded against, when he creeps
on us secretly; when, deceiving by the appearance of peace, he steals forward by hidden approaches,
whence also he has received the name of the Serpent.3100 That is always his subtlety;
that is his dark and stealthy artifice for circumventing man. Thus from the very beginning
of the world he deceived; and flattering with lying words, he misled inexperienced souls by
an incautious credulity. Thus he endeavoured to tempt the Lord Himself: he secretly approached
Him, as if he would creep on Him again, and deceive; yet he was understood, and
beaten back, and therefore prostrated, because he was recognised and detected.</p>
<p>2. From which an example is given us to avoid the way of the old man, to stand in the
footsteps of a conquering3101 Christ, that we may not again be incautiously turned back
into the nets of death, but, foreseeing our danger, may possess the immortality that we have
received. But how can we possess immortality, unless we keep those commands of Christ
whereby death is driven out and overcome, when He Himself warns us, and says, “If thou
wilt enter into life, keep the commandments?”3102 And again: “If ye do the things that I
command you, henceforth I call you not servants, but friends.”3103 Finally, these persons
He calls strong and stedfast; these He declares to be founded in robust security upon the
rock, established with immoveable and unshaken firmness, in opposition to all the tempests
and hurricanes of the world. “Whosoever,” says He, “heareth my words, and doeth them, I
will liken him unto a wise man, that built his house upon a rock: the rain descended, the
floods came, the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded
upon a rock.”3104 We ought therefore to stand fast on His words, to learn and do whatever
He both taught and did. But how can a man say that he believes in Christ, who does not do
what Christ commanded him to do? Or whence shall he attain to the reward of faith, who
will not keep the faith of the commandment? He must of necessity waver and wander, and,
caught away by a spirit of error, like dust which is shaken by the wind, be blown about; and
he will make no advance in his walk towards salvation, because he does not keep the truth
of the way of salvation.</p>

more subtle, than for this enemy, detected and cast down by the advent of Christ, after light
has come to the nations, and saving rays have shone for the preservation of men, that the
deaf might receive the hearing of spiritual grace, the blind might open their eyes to God,

and his temples deserted by the numerous concourse of believers—to devise a new fraud,
and under the very title of the Christian name to deceive the incautious? He has invented
heresies and schisms, whereby he might subvert the faith, might corrupt the truth, might
divide the unity.3105 Those whom he cannot keep in the darkness of the old way, he circumvents
and deceives by the error of a new way. He snatches men from the Church itself; and
while they seem to themselves to have already approached to the light, and to have escaped
the night of the world, he pours over them again, in their unconsciousness, new darkness;
so that, although they do not stand firm with the Gospel of Christ, and with the observation
and law of Christ, they still call themselves Christians, and, walking in darkness, they think
that they have the light, while the adversary is flattering and deceiving, who, according to
the apostle’s word, transforms himself into an angel of light, and equips his ministers as if
they were the ministers of righteousness, who maintain night instead of day, death for salvation,
despair under the offer of hope, perfidy under the pretext of faith, antichrist under
the name of Christ; so that, while they feign things like the truth, they make void the truth
by their subtlety. This happens, beloved brethren, so long as we do not return to the source
of truth, as we do not seek the head nor keep the teaching of the heavenly Master.</p>
<p>4. If any one consider and examine these things, there is no need for lengthened discussion
and arguments. There is easy proof for faith in a short summary of the truth. The Lord
speaks to Peter,3106 saying, “I say unto thee, that thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will
build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee
the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
also in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”3107 And

of the existence of any such things. Otherwise, how could they have been overlooked in a treatise devoted to the
subject of unity, its nature and its criteria? The effort to foist into the text something of the kind, by corruption,
demonstrates how entirely unsatisfactory to the Middle-Age theorists and dogmatists is the unadulterated work,
which they could not let alone.]</note>

again to the same He says, after His resurrection, “Feed my sheep.”3108 And although to all
the apostles, after His resurrection, He gives an equal power, and says, “As the Father hath
sent me, even so send I you: Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose soever sins ye remit, they
shall be remitted unto him; and whose soever sins ye retain, they shall be retained;”3109 yet,
that He might set forth unity, He arranged by His authority the origin of that unity, as beginning
from one. Assuredly the rest of the apostles were also the same as was Peter, endowed
with a like partnership both of honour and power; but the beginning proceeds from unity.3110
Which one Church, also, the Holy Spirit in the Song of Songs designated in the person of
our Lord, and says, “My dove, my spotless one, is but one. She is the only one of her mother,
elect of her that bare her.”3111 Does he who does not hold this unity of the Church think
that he holds the faith? Does he who strives against and resists the Church3112 trust that he
is in the Church, when moreover the blessed Apostle Paul teaches the same thing, and sets
forth the sacrament of unity, saying, “There is one body and one spirit, one hope of your
calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God?”3113</p>
<p>5. And this unity we ought firmly to hold and assert, especially those of us that are
bishops who preside in the Church, that we may also prove the episcopate itself to be one
and undivided.3114 Let no one deceive the brotherhood by a falsehood: let no one corrupt
the truth of the faith by perfidious prevarication. The episcopate is one, each part of which
is held by each one for the whole.3115 The Church also is one, which is spread abroad far
and wide into a multitude by an increase of fruitfulness. As there are many rays of the sun,
but one light; and many branches of a tree, but one strength based in its tenacious root; and
since from one spring flow many streams, although the multiplicity seems diffused in the
liberality of an overflowing abundance, yet the unity is still preserved in the source. Separate
a ray of the sun from its body of light, its unity does not allow a division of light; break a
branch from a tree,—when broken, it will not be able to bud; cut off the stream from its

fountain, and that which is cut off dries up. Thus also the Church, shone over with the light
of the Lord, sheds forth her rays over the whole world, yet it is one light which is everywhere
diffused, nor is the unity of the body separated. Her fruitful abundance spreads her branches
over the whole world. She broadly expands her rivers, liberally flowing, yet her head is one,
her source one; and she is one mother, plentiful in the results of fruitfulness: from her womb
we are born, by her milk we are nourished, by her spirit we are animated.</p>
<p>6. The spouse of Christ cannot be adulterous; she is uncorrupted and pure. She knows
one home; she guards with chaste modesty the sanctity of one couch. She keeps us for God.
She appoints the sons whom she has born for the kingdom. Whoever is separated from the
Church and is joined to an adulteress, is separated from the promises of the Church; nor
can he who forsakes the Church of Christ attain to the rewards of Christ. He is a stranger;
he is profane; he is an enemy. He can no longer have God for his Father, who has not the
Church for his mother. If any one could escape who was outside the ark of Noah, then he
also may escape who shall be outside of the Church. The Lord warns, saying, “He who is
not with me is against me, and he who gathereth not with me scattereth.”3116 He who breaks
the peace and the concord of Christ, does so in opposition to Christ; he who gathereth
elsewhere than in the Church, scatters the Church of Christ. The Lord says, “I and the
Father are one;”3117 and again it is written of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit, “And these three are one.”3118 And does any one believe that this unity which thus
comes from the divine strength and coheres in celestial sacraments, can be divided in the
Church, and can be separated by the parting asunder of opposing wills? He who does not
hold this unity does not hold God’s law, does not hold the faith of the Father and the Son,
does not hold life and salvation.</p>
<p>7. This sacrament of unity, this bond of a concord inseparably cohering, is set forth
where in the Gospel the coat of the Lord Jesus Christ is not at all divided nor cut, but is received
as an entire garment, and is possessed as an uninjured and undivided robe by those
who cast lots concerning Christ’s garment, who should rather put on Christ.3119 Holy
Scripture speaks, saying, “But of the coat, because it was not sewed, but woven from the top
throughout, they said one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots whose it shall be.”3120
That coat bore with it an unity that came down from the top, that is, that came from heaven

and the Father, which was not to be at all rent by the receiver and the possessor, but without
separation we obtain a whole and substantial entireness. He cannot possess the garment of
Christ who parts and divides the Church of Christ. On the other hand, again, when at Solomon’s
death his kingdom and people were divided, Abijah the prophet, meeting Jeroboam
the king in the field, divided his garment into twelve sections, saying, “Take thee ten pieces;
for thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I
will give ten sceptres unto thee; and two sceptres shall be unto him for my servant David’s
sake, and for Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen to place my name there.”3121 As the
twelve tribes of Israel were divided, the prophet Abijah rent his garment. But because Christ’s
people cannot be rent, His robe, woven and united throughout, is not divided by those who
possess it; undivided, united, connected, it shows the coherent concord of our people who
put on Christ. By the sacrament and sign of His garment, He has declared the unity of the
Church.</p>
<p>8. Who, then, is so wicked and faithless, who is so insane with the madness of discord,
that either he should believe that the unity of God can be divided, or should dare to rend
it—the garment of the Lord—the Church of Christ? He Himself in His Gospel warns us,
and teaches, saying, “And there shall be one flock and one shepherd.”3122 And does any
one believe that in one place there can be either many shepherds or many flocks? The Apostle
Paul, moreover, urging upon us this same unity, beseeches and exhorts, saying, “I beseech
you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and
that there be no schisms among you; but that ye be joined together in the same mind and
in the same judgment.”3123 And again, he says, “Forbearing one another in love, endeavouring
to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”3124 Do you think that you can stand
and live if you withdraw from the Church, building for yourself other homes and a different
dwelling, when it is said to Rahab, in whom was prefigured the Church, “Thy father, and
thy mother, and thy brethren, and all the house of thy father, thou shalt gather unto thee
into thine house; and it shall come to pass, whosoever shall go abroad beyond the door of
thine house, his blood shall be upon his own head?”3125 Also, the sacrament of the passover
contains nothing else in the law of the Exodus than that the lamb which is slain in the figure
of Christ should be eaten in one house. God speaks, saying, “In one house shall ye eat it; ye
shall not send its flesh abroad from the house.”3126 The flesh of Christ, and the holy of the

Lord, cannot be sent abroad, nor is there any other home to believers but the one Church.
This home, this household3127 of unanimity, the Holy Spirit designates and points out in
the Psalms, saying, “God, who maketh men to dwell with one mind in a house.”3128 In the
house of God, in the Church of Christ, men dwell with one mind, and continue in concord
and simplicity.</p>
<p>9. Therefore also the Holy Spirit came as a dove, a simple and joyous creature, not bitter
with gall, not cruel in its bite, not violent with the rending of its claws, loving human
dwellings, knowing the association of one home; when they have young, bringing forth their
young together; when they fly abroad, remaining in their flights by the side of one another,
spending their life in mutual intercourse, acknowledging the concord of peace with the kiss
of the beak, in all things fulfilling the law of unanimity. This is the simplicity that ought to
be known in the Church, this is the charity that ought to be attained, that so the love of the
brotherhood may imitate the doves, that their gentleness and meekness may be like the
lambs and sheep. What does the fierceness of wolves do in the Christian breast? What the
savageness of dogs, and the deadly venom of serpents, and the sanguinary cruelty of wild
beasts? We are to be congratulated when such as these are separated from the Church, lest
they should lay waste the doves and sheep of Christ with their cruel and envenomed contagion.
Bitterness cannot consist and be associated with sweetness, darkness with light, rain
with clearness, battle with peace, barrenness with fertility, drought with springs, storm with
tranquillity. Let none think that the good can depart from the Church. The wind does not
carry away the wheat, nor does the hurricane uproot the tree that is based on a solid root.
The light straws are tossed about by the tempest, the feeble trees are overthrown by the onset
of the whirlwind. The Apostle John execrates and severely assails these, when he says, “They
went forth from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, surely they would
have continued with us.”3129</p>
<p>10. Hence heresies not only have frequently been originated, but continue to be so; while
the perverted mind has no peace—while a discordant faithlessness does not maintain unity.
But the Lord permits and suffers these things to be, while the choice of one’s own liberty
remains, so that while the discrimination of truth is testing our hearts and our minds, the
sound faith of those that are approved may shine forth with manifest light. The Holy Spirit
forewarns and says by the apostle, “It is needful also that there should be heresies, that they
which are approved may be made manifest among you.”3130 Thus the faithful are approved,
thus the perfidious are detected; thus even here, before the day of judgment, the souls of the

righteous and of the unrighteous are already divided, and the chaff is separated from the
wheat. These are they who of their own accord, without any divine arrangement, set themselves
to preside among the daring strangers assembled, who appoint themselves prelates
without any law of ordination, who assume to themselves the name of bishop, although no
one gives them the episcopate; whom the Holy Spirit points out in the Psalms as sitting in
the seat of pestilence, plagues, and spots of the faith, deceiving with serpent’s tongue, and
artful in corrupting the truth, vomiting forth deadly poisons from pestilential tongues; whose
speech doth creep like a cancer, whose discourse forms a deadly poison in the heart and
breast of every one.</p>
<p>11. Against people of this kind the Lord cries; from these He restrains and recalls His
erring people, saying, “Hearken not unto the words of the false prophets; for the visions of
their hearts deceive them. They speak, but not out of the mouth of the Lord. They say to
those who cast away the word of God, Ye shall have peace, and every one that walketh after
his own will. Every one who walketh in the error of his heart, no evil shall come upon him.
I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. If they had stood on my foundation (substantia,
ὑποστάσει), and had heard my words, and taught my people, I would have turned
them from their evil thoughts.”3131 Again, the Lord points out and designates these same,
saying, “They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and have hewed them out
broken cisterns which can hold no water.”3132 Although there can be no other baptism but
one, they think that they can baptize; although they forsake the fountain of life, they promise
the grace of living and saving water. Men are not washed among them, but rather are made
foul; nor are sins purged away, but are even accumulated. Such a nativity does not generate
sons to God, but to the devil. By a falsehood they are born, and they do not receive the
promises of truth. Begotten of perfidy, they lose the grace of faith. They cannot attain to
the reward of peace, since they have broken the Lord’s peace with the madness of discord.</p>
<p>12. Nor let any deceive themselves by a futile interpretation, in respect of the Lord
having said, “Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in
the midst of them.”3133 Corrupters and false interpreters of the Gospel quote the last words,
and lay aside the former ones, remembering part, and craftily suppressing part: as they
themselves are separated from the Church, so they cut off the substance of one section. For
the Lord, when He would urge unanimity and peace upon His disciples, said, “I say unto
you, That if two of you shall agree on earth touching anything that ye shall ask, it shall be
given you by my Father which is in heaven. For wheresoever two or three are gathered together
in my name, I am with them;”3134 showing that most is given, not to the multitude,

but to the unanimity of those that pray. “If,” He says, “two of you shall agree on earth:” He
placed agreement first; He has made the concord of peace a prerequisite; He taught that we
should agree firmly and faithfully. But how can he agree with any one who does not agree
with the body of the Church itself, and with the universal brotherhood? How can two or
three be assembled together in Christ’s name, who, it is evident, are separated from Christ
and from His Gospel? For we have not withdrawn from them, but they from us; and since
heresies and schisms have risen subsequently, from their establishment for themselves of
diverse places of worship, they have forsaken the Head and Source of the truth. But the Lord
speaks concerning His Church, and to those also who are in the Church He speaks, that if
they are in agreement, if according to what He commanded and admonished, although only
two or three gathered together with unanimity should pray—though they be only two or
three—they may obtain from the majesty of God what they ask. “Wheresoever two or three
are gathered together in my name, I,” says He, “am with them;” that is, with the simple and
peaceable—with those who fear God and keep God’s commandments. With these, although
only two or three, He said that He was, in the same manner as He was with the three youths
in the fiery furnace; and because they abode towards God in simplicity, and in unanimity
among themselves, He animated them, in the midst of the surrounding flames, with the
breath of dew: in the way in which, with the two apostles shut up in prison, because they
were simple-minded and of one mind, He Himself was present; He Himself, having loosed
the bolts of the dungeon, placed them again in the market-place, that they might declare to
the multitude the word which they faithfully preached. When, therefore, in His commandments
He lays it down, and says, “Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I
am with them,” He does not divide men from the Church, seeing that He Himself ordained
and made the Church; but rebuking the faithless for their discord, and commending peace
by His word to the faithful, He shows that He is rather with two or three who pray with one
mind, than with a great many who differ, and that more can be obtained by the discordant
prayer of a few, than by the discordant supplication of many.</p>
<p>13. Thus, also, when He gave the law of prayer, He added, saying, “And when ye stand
praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any; that your Father also which is in heaven may
forgive you your trespasses.”3135 And He calls back from the altar one who comes to the
sacrifice in strife, and bids him first agree with his brother, and then return with peace and
offer his gift to God: for God had not respect unto Cain’s offerings; for he could not have
God at peace with him, who through envious discord had not peace with his brother. What
peace, then, do the enemies of the brethren promise to themselves? What sacrifices do those
who are rivals of the priests think that they celebrate? Do they deem that they have Christ

with them when they are collected together, who are gathered together outside the Church
of Christ?</p>
<p>14. Even if such men were slain in confession of the Name, that stain is not even washed
away by blood: the inexpiable and grave fault of discord is not even purged by suffering. He
cannot be a martyr who is not in the Church; he cannot attain unto the kingdom who forsakes
that which shall reign there. Christ gave us peace; He bade us be in agreement, and of one
mind. He charged the bonds of love and charity to be kept uncorrupted and inviolate; he
cannot show himself a martyr who has not maintained brotherly love. Paul the apostle
teaches this, and testifies, saying, “And though I have faith, so that I can remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and
though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity
is magnanimous; charity is kind; charity envieth not; charity acteth not vainly, is not puffed
up, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; loveth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth.”3136 “Charity,” says he, “never faileth.”
For she will ever be in the kingdom, she will endure for ever in the unity of a brotherhood
linked to herself. Discord cannot attain to the kingdom of heaven; to the rewards of Christ,
who said, “This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you:”3137
he cannot attain3138 who has violated the love of Christ by faithless dissension. He who has
not charity has not God. The word of the blessed Apostle John is: “God,” saith he, “is love;
and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God dwelleth in him.”3139 They cannot
dwell with God who would not be of one mind in God’s Church. Although they burn, given
up to flames and fires, or lay down their lives, thrown to the wild beasts, that will not be the
crown of faith, but the punishment of perfidy; nor will it be the glorious ending of religious
valour, but the destruction of despair. Such a one may be slain; crowned he cannot be. He
professes himself to be a Christian in such a way as the devil often feigns himself to be Christ,
as the Lord Himself forewarns us, and says, “Many shall come in my name, saying, I am
Christ, and shall deceive many.”3140 As he is not Christ, although he deceives in respect of
the name; so neither can he appear as a Christian who does not abide in the truth of His
Gospel and of faith.</p>
<p>15. For both to prophesy and to cast out devils, and to do great acts upon the earth is
certainly a sublime and an admirable thing; but one does not attain the kingdom of heaven

just way. The Lord denounces, and says, “Many shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have
we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name have cast out devils, and in Thy name
done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart
from me, ye that work iniquity.”3141 There is need of righteousness, that one may deserve
well of God the Judge; we must obey His precepts and warnings, that our merits may receive
their reward. The Lord in His Gospel, when He would direct the way of our hope and faith
in a brief summary, said, “The Lord thy God is one God: and thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment;
and the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these
two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”3142 He taught, at the same time,
love and unity by His instruction. He has included all the prophets and the law in two precepts.
But what unity does he keep, what love does he maintain or consider, who, savage
with the madness of discord, divides the Church, destroys the faith, disturbs the peace, dissipates
charity, profanes the sacrament?</p>
<p>16. This evil, most faithful brethren, had long ago begun, but now the mischievous destruction
of the same evil has increased, and the envenomed plague of heretical perversity
and schisms has begun to spring forth and shoot anew; because even thus it must be in the
decline of the world, since the Holy Spirit foretells and forewarns us by the apostle, saying,
“In the last days,” says he, “perilous times shall come, and men shall be lovers of their own
selves, proud, boasters, covetous, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, hating the good,
traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, having a sort of
form3143 of religion, but denying the power thereof. Of this sort are they who creep into
houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, which are led away with divers lusts;
ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of the truth. And as Jannes and Jambres
withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth;3144 but they shall proceed no further, for
their folly shall be manifest unto all men, even as theirs also was.”3145 Whatever things were
predicted are fulfilled; and as the end of the world is approaching, they have come for the
probation as well of the men as of the times. Error deceives as the adversary rages more and

pride puffs up, discord exasperates, anger hurries headlong.</p>
<p>17. Yet let not the excessive and headlong faithlessness of many move or disturb us, but
rather strengthen our faith in the truthfulness which has foretold the matter. As some have
become such, because these things were predicted beforehand, so let other brethren beware
of matters of a like kind, because these also were predicted beforehand, even as the Lord
instructs us, and says, “But take ye heed: behold, I have told you all things.”3146 Avoid, I
beseech you, brethren, men of this kind, and drive away from your side and from your ears,
as if it were the contagion of death, their mischievous conversation; as it is written, “Hedge
thine ears about with thorns, and refuse to hear a wicked tongue.”3147 And again, “Evil
communications corrupt good manners.”3148 The Lord teaches and warns us to depart from
such. He saith, “They are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, they shall
both fall into the ditch.”3149 Such a one is to be turned away from and avoided, whosoever
he may be, that is separated from the Church. Such a one is perverted and sins, and is condemned
of his own self. Does he think that he has Christ, who acts in opposition to Christ’s
priests, who separates himself from the company of His clergy and people? He bears arms
against the Church, he contends against God’s appointment. An enemy of the altar, a rebel
against Christ’s sacrifice, for the faith faithless, for religion profane, a disobedient servant,
an impious son, a hostile brother, despising the bishops, and forsaking God’s priests, he
dares to set up another altar, to make another prayer with unauthorized words, to profane
the truth of the Lord’s offering by false sacrifices, and not3150 to know that he who strives
against the appointment of God, is punished on account of the daring of his temerity by
divine visitation.</p>
<p>18. Thus Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, who endeavoured to claim to themselves the
power of sacrificing in opposition to Moses and Aaron the priest, underwent immediate
punishment for their attempts. The earth, breaking its fastenings, gaped open into a deep
gulf, and the cleft of the receding ground swallowed up the men standing and living. Nor
did the anger of the indignant God strike only those who had been the movers (of the sedition);
but two hundred and fifty sharers and associates of that madness besides, who had
been mingled with them in that boldness, the fire that went out from the Lord consumed
with a hasty revenge; doubtless to admonish and show that whatever those wicked men had
endeavoured, in order by human will to overthrow God’s appointment, had been done in

opposition to God. Thus also Uzziah the king,—when he bare the censer and violently
claimed to himself to sacrifice against God’s law, and when Azariah the priest withstood
him, would not be obedient and yield,—was confounded by the divine indignation, and was
polluted upon his forehead by the spot of leprosy: he was marked by an offended Lord in
that part of his body where they are signed who deserve well of the Lord. And the sons of
Aaron, who placed strange fire upon the altar, which the Lord had not commanded, were
at once extinguished in the presence of an avenging Lord.</p>
<p>19. These, doubtless, they imitate and follow, who, despising God’s tradition, seek after
strange doctrines, and bring in teachings of human appointment, whom the Lord rebukes
and reproves in His Gospel, saying, “Ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep
your own tradition.”3151 This is a worse crime than that which the lapsed seem to have
fallen into, who nevertheless, standing as penitents for their crime, beseech God with full
satisfactions. In this case, the Church is sought after and entreated; in that case, the Church
is resisted: here it is possible that there has been necessity; there the will is engaged in the
wickedness: on the one hand, he who has lapsed has only injured himself; on the other, he
who has endeavoured to cause a heresy or a schism has deceived many by drawing them
with him. In the former, it is the loss of one soul; in the latter, the risk of many. Certainly
the one both understands that he has sinned, and laments and bewails it; the other, puffed
up in his heart, and pleasing himself in his very crimes, separates sons from their Mother,
entices sheep from their shepherd, disturbs the sacraments of God; and while the lapsed has
sinned but once, he sins daily. Finally, the lapsed, who has subsequently attained to martyrdom,
may receive the promises of the kingdom; while the other, if he have been slain without
the Church, cannot attain to the rewards of the Church.</p>
<p>20. Nor let any one marvel, beloved brethren, that even some of the confessors advance
to these lengths, and thence also that some others sin thus wickedly, thus grievously. For
neither does confession make a man free from the snares of the devil, nor does it defend a
man who is still placed in the world, with a perpetual security from temptations, and dangers,
and onsets, and attacks of the world; otherwise we should never see in confessors those
subsequent frauds, and fornications, and adulteries, which now with groans and sorrow we
witness in some. Whosoever that confessor is, he is not greater, or better, or dearer to God
than Solomon, who, although so long as he walked in God’s ways, retained that grace which
he had received from the Lord, yet after he forsook the Lord’s way he lost also then Lord’s
grace.3152 And therefore it is written, “Hold fast that which thou hast, lest another take thy
crown.”3153 But assuredly the Lord would not threaten that the crown of righteousness
<note type="footnote">3151 Mark vii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">3152 Some read, “As it is written, And the Lord stirred up the adversary (Satan) against Solomon; and therefore
in the Apocalypse the Lord solemnly warns John.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3153 Apoc. iii. 11.</note>

<pb n="1005"/>
might be taken away, were it not that, when righteousness departs, the crown must also
depart.</p>
<p>21. Confession is the beginning of glory, not the full desert of the crown; nor does it
perfect our praise, but it initiates our dignity; and since it is written, “He that endureth to
the end, the same shall be saved,”3154 whatever has been before the end is a step by which
we ascend to the summit of salvation, not a terminus wherein the full result of the ascent is
already gained. He is a confessor; but after confession his peril is greater, because the adversary
is more provoked. He is a confessor; for this cause he ought the more to stand on
the side of the Lord’s Gospel, since he has by the Gospel attained glory from the Lord. For
the Lord says, “To whom much is given, of him much shall be required; and to whom more
dignity is ascribed, of him more service is exacted.”3155 Let no one perish by the example
of a confessor; let no one learn injustice, let no one learn arrogance, let no one learn
treachery, from the manners of a confessor. He is a confessor, let him be lowly and quiet;
let him be in his doings modest with discipline, so that he who is called a confessor of Christ
may imitate Christ whom he confesses. For since He says, “Whosoever exalteth himself shall
be abased, and he who humbleth himself shall be exalted;”3156 and since He Himself has
been exalted by the Father, because as the Word, and the strength, and the wisdom of God
the Father, He humbled Himself upon earth, how can He love arrogance, who even by His
own law enjoined upon us humility, and Himself received the highest name from the Father
as the reward of His humility? He is a confessor of Christ, but only so if the majesty and
dignity of Christ be not afterwards blasphemed by him. Let not the tongue which has confessed
Christ be evil-speaking; let it not be turbulent, let it not be heard jarring with reproaches
and quarrels, let it not after words of praise, dart forth serpents’ venom against
the brethren and God’s priests. But if one shall have subsequently been blameworthy and
obnoxious; if he shall have wasted his confession by evil conversation; if he shall have stained
his life by disgraceful foulness; if, finally, forsaking the Church in which he has become a
confessor, and severing the concord of unity, he shall have exchanged his first faith for a
subsequent unbelief, he may not flatter himself on account of his confession that he is elected
to the reward of glory, when from this very fact his deserving of punishment has become
the greater.</p>
<p>22. For the Lord chose Judas also among the apostles, and yet afterwards Judas betrayed
the Lord. Yet not on that account did the faith and firmness of the apostles fail, because the
traitor Judas failed from their fellowship: so also in the case in question the holiness and
dignity of confessors is not forthwith diminished, because the faith of some of them is
<note type="footnote">3154 Matt. x. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">3155 Luke xii. 48.</note>
<note type="footnote">3156 Luke xviii. 14.</note>

<pb n="1006"/>
broken. The blessed Apostle Paul in his epistle speaks in this manner: “For what if some of
them fall away from the faith, shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God
forbid: for God is true, though every man be a liar.”3157 The greater and better part of the
confessors stand firm in the strength of their faith, and in the truth of the law and discipline
of the Lord; neither do they depart from the peace of the Church, who remember that they
have obtained grace in the Church by the condescension of God; and by this very thing they
obtain a higher praise of their faith, that they have separated from the faithlessness of those
who have been associated with them in the fellowship of confession, and withdrawn from
the contagion of crime. Illuminated by the true light of the Gospel, shone upon with the
Lord’s pure and white brightness, they are as praiseworthy in maintaining the peace of
Christ, as they have been victorious in their combat with the devil.</p>
<p>23. I indeed desire, beloved brethren, and I equally endeavour and exhort, that if it be
possible, none of the brethren should perish, and that our rejoicing Mother may enclose in
her bosom the one body of a people at agreement. Yet if wholesome counsel cannot recall
to the way of salvation certain leaders of schisms and originators of dissensions, who abide
in blind and obstinate madness, yet do you others, if either taken in simplicity, or induced
by error, or deceived by some craftiness of misleading cunning, loose yourselves from the
nets of deceit, free your wandering steps from errors, acknowledge the straight way of the
heavenly road. The word of the witnessing apostle is: “We command you,” says he, “in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from all brethren that walk
disorderly, and not after the tradition that they have received from us.”3158 And again he
says, “Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath
of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them.”3159
We must withdraw, nay rather must flee, from those who fall away, lest, while any one is
associated with those who walk wickedly, and goes on in ways of error and of sin, he himself
also, wandering away from the path of the true road, should be found in like guilt. God is
one, and Christ is one, and His Church is one, and the faith is one, and the people3160 is
joined into a substantial unity of body by the cement of concord. Unity cannot be severed;
nor can one body be separated by a division of its structure, nor torn into pieces, with its
entrails wrenched asunder by laceration. Whatever has proceeded from the womb cannot
live and breathe in its detached condition, but loses the substance of health.</p>
<p>24. The Holy Spirit warns us, and says, “What man is he that desireth to live, and would
fain see good days? Refrain thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they speak no guile. Eschew

evil, and do good; seek peace, and ensue it.”3161 The son of peace ought to seek peace and
ensue it. He who knows and loves the bond of charity, ought to refrain his tongue from the
evil of dissension. Among His divine commands and salutary teachings, the Lord, when He
was now very near to His passion, added this one, saying, “Peace I leave with you, my peace
I give unto you.”3162 He gave this to us as an heritage; He promised all the gifts and rewards
of which He spoke through the preservation of peace. If we are fellow-heirs with Christ, let
us abide in the peace of Christ; if we are sons of God, we ought to be peacemakers. “Blessed,”
says He, “are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the sons of God.”3163 It behoves the
sons of God to be peacemakers, gentle in heart, simple in speech, agreeing in affection,
faithfully linked to one another in the bonds of unanimity.</p>
<p>25. This unanimity formerly prevailed among the apostles; and thus the new assembly
of believers, keeping the Lord’s commandments, maintained its charity. Divine Scripture
proves this, when it says, “But the multitude of them which believed were of one heart and
of one soul.”3164 And again: “These all continued with one mind in prayer with the women,
and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brethren.”3165 And thus3166 they prayed with
effectual prayers; thus they were able with confidence to obtain whatever they asked from
the Lord’s mercy.</p>
<p>26. But in us unanimity is diminished in proportion as liberality of working is decayed.
Then they used to give for sale houses and estates; and that they might lay up for themselves
treasures in heaven, presented to the apostles the price of them, to be distributed for the use
of the poor. But now we do not even give the tenths from our patrimony; and while our
Lord bids us sell, we rather buy and increase our store. Thus has the vigour of faith dwindled
away among us; thus has the strength of believers grown weak. And therefore the Lord,
looking to our days, says in His Gospel, “When the Son of man cometh, think you that He
shall find faith on the earth?”3167 We see that what He foretold has come to pass. There is
no faith in the fear of God, in the law of righteousness, in love, in labour; none considers
the fear of futurity, and none takes to heart the day of the Lord, and the wrath of God, and
the punishments to come upon unbelievers, and the eternal torments decreed for the faithless.
That which our conscience would fear if it believed, it fears not because it does not at all
believe. But if it believed, it would also take heed; and if it took heed, it would escape.</p>

<p>27. Let us, beloved brethren, arouse ourselves as much as we can; and breaking the
slumber of our ancient listlessness, let us be watchful to observe and to do the Lord’s precepts.
Let us be such as He Himself has bidden us to be, saying, “Let your loins be girt, and your
lamps burning;3168 and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord, when He shall
come from the wedding, that when He cometh and knocketh, they may open to Him. Blessed
are those servants whom their Lord, when He cometh, shall find watching.”3169 We ought
to be girt about, lest, when the day of setting forth comes, it should find us burdened and
entangled. Let our light shine in good works, and glow in such wise as to lead us from the
night of this world to the daylight of eternal brightness. Let us always with solicitude and
caution wait for the sudden coming of the Lord, that when He shall knock, our faith may
be on the watch, and receive from the Lord the reward of our vigilance. If these commands
be observed, if these warnings and precepts be kept, we cannot be overtaken in slumber by
the deceit of the devil; but we shall reign with Christ in His kingdom as servants that watch.</p>

<head>Treatise II.3170</head>
<p>On the Dress of Virgins.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Celebrates the Praises of Discipline, and Proves Its Usefulness
from Scripture. Then, Describing the Glory, Honour, and Merits of Virginity,
and of Those Who Had Vowed and Dedicated Their Virginity to Christ, He
Teaches that Continence Not Only Consists in Fleshly Purity, But Also in
Seemliness of Dress and Ornament, and that Even Wealth Did Not Excuse Superfluous
Care for Dress on the Part of Those Who Had Already Renounced the
World. Rather, Since the Apostle Prescribes Even to Married Women a Dress
to Be Regulated by Fitting Limits, Moderation Ought Even More to Be Observed
by a Virgin. Therefore, Even If She Be Wealthy, She Should Consider Certainly
How to Use Wealth, But for Good Purposes, for Those Things Which God Has
Commanded, to Wit, for Being Spent on the Poor.3171 Moreover, Also, He Forbids
to Virgins Those Things Which Had Negligently Come into Use, as Being Present
at Weddings, as Well as Going to Promiscuous Bathing-Places. Finally, in a Brief
Epilogue,3172 Declaring What Benefit the Virtue of Continency Affords, and
What Evil It is Without, He Concludes the Book.</p>
<p>1. Discipline, the safeguard of hope, the bond of faith, the guide of the way of salvation,
the stimulus and nourishment of good dispositions, the teacher of virtue, causes us to abide
always in Christ, and to live continually for God, and to attain to the heavenly promises and
to the divine rewards. To follow her is wholesome, and to turn away from her and neglect
her is deadly. The Holy Spirit says in the Psalms, “Keep discipline, lest perchance the Lord
be angry, and ye perish from the right way, when His wrath is quickly kindled against
you.”3173 And again: “But unto the ungodly saith God, “Why dost thou preach my laws,
<note type="footnote">3170 The deacon Pontius, in his life of Cyprian, in few words comprises the argument of the following treatise.
“Who,” says he, “would restrain virgins into a fitting discipline of modesty, and a dress meet for holiness, as if
with a bridle of the Lord’s lessons?”</note>
<note type="footnote">3171 After this he teaches from the Apostle, and from the third chapter of Isaiah also, that distinctions of
dress and ornaments are more suited to prostitutes than to virgins; and he infers that, while so many things are
offensive to God, more especially are the sumptuous ornaments of women; and therefore making a transition
from superfluous ornament to the different kinds of dyes and paints, he forbids such things, not only to virgins,
but absolutely also to married women, who assuredly cannot with impunity strive to improve, to transfigure,
and to adulterate God’s work.</note>
<note type="footnote">3172 [Written, a.d. 248. Compare Tertullian, vol. iv. p. 14.]</note>

<pb n="1010"/>
and takest my covenant into thy mouth? Whereas thou hatest discipline, and hast cast my
words behind thee.”3174 And again we read: “He that casteth away discipline is miserable.”3175
And from Solomon we have received the mandates of wisdom, warning us: “My son, despise
not thou the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him: for whom the
Lord loveth He correcteth.”3176 But if God rebukes whom He loves, and rebukes him for
the very purpose of amending him, brethren also, and especially priests, do not hate, but
love those whom they rebuke, that they may mend them; since God also before predicted
by Jeremiah, and pointed to our times, when he said, “And I will give you shepherds according
to my heart: and they shall feed you with the food of discipline.”3177</p>
<p>2. But if in Holy Scripture discipline is frequently and everywhere prescribed, and the
whole foundation of religion and of faith proceeds from obedience and fear; what is more
fitting for us urgently to desire, what more to wish for and to hold fast, than to stand with
roots strongly fixed, and with our houses based with solid mass upon the rock unshaken by
the storms and whirlwinds of the world, so that we may come by the divine precepts to the
rewards of God? considering as well as knowing that our members, when purged from all
the filth of the old contagion by the sanctification of the laver of life, are God’s temples, and
must not be violated nor polluted, since he who does violence to them is himself injured.
We are the worshippers and priests of those temples; let us obey Him whose we have already
begun to be. Paul tells us in his epistles, in which he has formed us to a course of living by
divine teaching, “Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a great price; glorify and bear
God in your body.”3178 Let us glorify and bear God in a pure and chaste body, and with a
more complete obedience; and since we have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, let us
obey and give furtherance to the empire of our Redeemer by all the obedience of service,
that nothing impure or profane may be brought into the temple of God, lest He should be
offended, and forsake the temple which He inhabits. The words of the Lord giving health
and teaching, as well curing as warning, are: “Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more,
lest a worse thing come unto thee.”3179 He gives the course of life, He gives the law of innocency
after He has conferred health, nor suffers the man afterwards to wander with free and
unchecked reins, but more severely threatens him who is again enslaved by those same
things of which he had been healed, because it is doubtless a smaller fault to have sinned

before, while as yet you had not known God’s discipline; but there is no further pardon for
sinning after you have begun to know God. And, indeed, let as well men as women, as well
boys as girls; let each sex and every age observe this, and take care in this respect, according
to the religion and faith which they owe to God, that what is received holy and pure from
the condescension of the Lord be preserved with a no less anxious fear.3180</p>
<p>3. My address is now to virgins, whose glory, as it is more eminent, excites the greater
interest. This is the flower of the ecclesiastical seed,3181 the grace and ornament of spiritual
endowment, a joyous disposition, the wholesome and uncorrupted work of praise and
honour, God’s image answering to the holiness of the Lord, the more illustrious portion of
Christ’s flock. The glorious fruitfulness of Mother Church rejoices by their means, and in
them abundantly flourishes; and in proportion as a copious virginity is added to her number,
so much the more it increases the joy of the Mother. To these I speak, these I exhort with
affection rather than with power; not that I would claim—last and least, and very conscious
of my lowliness as I am—any right to censure, but because, being unceasingly careful even
to solicitude, I fear more from the onset of Satan.</p>
<p>4. For that is not an empty carefulness nor a vain fear, which takes counsel for the way
of salvation, which guards the commandments of the Lord and of life; so that they who have
dedicated themselves to Christ, and who depart from carnal concupiscence, and have vowed
themselves to God as well in the flesh as in the spirit, may consummate their work, destined
as it is to a great reward, and may not study any longer to be adorned or to please anybody
but their Lord, from whom also they expect the reward of virginity; as He Himself says: “All
men cannot receive this word, but they to whom it is given. For there are some eunuchs,
which were so born from their mother’s womb; and there are some eunuchs, which were
made eunuchs of men; and there are eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven’s sake.”3182 Again, also by this word of the angel the gift of continency
is set forth, and virginity is preached: “These are they which have not defiled themselves
with women, for they have remained virgins; these are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever
He goeth.”3183 For not only thus does the Lord promise the grace of continency
to men, and pass over women; but since the woman is a portion of the man, and is taken
and formed from him, God in Scripture almost always speaks to the Protoplast, the first
formed, because they are two in one flesh, and in the male is at the same time signified the
woman also.</p>
<note type="footnote">3180 One codex adds here: “since it is written, ‘He who perseveres unto the end, the same shall be saved.’”</note>
<note type="footnote">3181 Otherwise, “These are the flowers of the ecclesiastical seed.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3182 Matt. xix. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">3183 Apoc. xiv. 4.</note>

<pb n="1012"/>
<p>5. But if continency follows Christ, and virginity is destined for the kingdom of God,
what have they to do with earthly dress, and with ornaments, wherewith while they are
striving to please men they offend God? Not considering that it is declared, “They who
please men are put to confusion, because God hath despised them;”3184 and that Paul also
has gloriously and sublimely uttered, “If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
Christ.”3185 But continence and modesty consist not alone in purity of the flesh, but also in
seemliness, as well as in modesty of dress and adornment; so that, according to the apostle,
she who is unmarried may be holy both in body and in spirit. Paul instructs and teaches us,
saying, “He that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please God: but
he who has contracted marriage careth for the things which are of this world, how he may
please his wife. So both the virgin and the unmarried woman consider those things which
are the Lord’s, that they may be holy both in body and spirit.”3186 A virgin ought not only
to be so, but also to be perceived and believed to be so: no one on seeing a virgin should be
in any doubt as to whether she is one. Perfectness should show itself equal in all things; nor
should the dress of the body discredit the good of the mind. Why should she walk out adorned?
Why with dressed hair, as if she either had or sought for a husband? Rather let her
dread to please if she is a virgin; and let her not invite her own risk, if she is keeping herself
for better and divine things. They who have not a husband whom they profess that they
please, should persevere, sound and pure not only in body, but also in spirit. For it is not
right that a virgin should have her hair braided for the appearance of her beauty, or boast
of her flesh and of its beauty, when she has no struggle greater than that against her flesh,
and no contest more obstinate than that of conquering and subduing the body.</p>
<p>6. Paul proclaims in a loud and lofty voice, “But God forbid that I should glory, save in
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world.”3187 And yet a virgin in the Church glories concerning her fleshly appearance and
the beauty of her body! Paul adds, and says, “For they that are Christ’s have crucified their
flesh, with its faults and lusts.”3188 And she who professes to have renounced the lusts and
vices of the flesh, is found in the midst of those very things which she has renounced! Virgin,
thou art taken, thou art exposed, thou boastest one thing and affectest another. You sprinkle
yourself with the stains of carnal concupiscence, although you are a candidate of purity and
modesty. “Cry,” says the Lord to Isaiah, “All flesh is grass, and all the glory of it as the flower
of the grass: the grass withereth, and the flower fadeth; but the word of the Lord endureth
<note type="footnote">3184 Ps. liii. 5.</note>

<note type="footnote">3186 1 Cor. vii. 32.</note>
<note type="footnote">3187 Gal. vi. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">3188 Gal. v. 24.</note>

<pb n="1013"/>
for ever.”3189 It is becoming for no Christian, and especially it is not becoming for a virgin,
to regard any glory and honour of the flesh, but only to desire the word of God, to embrace
benefits which shall endure for ever. Or, if she must glory in the flesh, then assuredly let her
glory when she is tortured in confession of the name; when a woman is found to be stronger
than the tortures; when she suffers fire, or the cross, or the sword, or the wild beasts, that
she may be crowned. These are the precious jewels of the flesh, these are the better ornaments
of the body.</p>
<p>7. But there are some rich women, and wealthy in the fertility of means, who prefer their
own wealth, and contend that they ought to use these blessings. Let them know first of all
that she is rich who is rich in God; that she is wealthy who is wealthy in Christ; that those
are blessings which are spiritual, divine, heavenly, which lead us to God, which abide with
us in perpetual possession with God. But whatever things are earthly, and have been received
in this world, and will remain here with the world, ought so to be contemned even as the
world itself is contemned, whose pomps and delights we have already renounced when by
a blessed passage we came to God. John stimulates and exhorts us, witnessing with a spiritual
and heavenly voice. “Love not the world,” says he, “neither the things that are in the world.
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world,
is lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not from the Father,
but is of the lust of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
doeth the will of God abideth for ever, even as God also abideth for ever.”3190 Therefore
eternal and divine things are to be followed, and all things must be done after the will of
God, that we may follow the divine footsteps and teachings of our Lord, who warned us,
and said, “I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent
me.”3191 But if the servant is not greater than his lord, and he that is freed owes obedience
to his deliverer, we who desire to be Christians ought to imitate what Christ said and did.
It is written, and it is read and heard, and is celebrated for our example by the Church’s
mouth, “He that saith he abideth in Christ, ought himself also so to walk even as He
walked.”3192 Therefore we must walk with equal steps; we must strive with emulous walk.
Then the following of truth answers to the faith of our name, and a reward is given to the
believer, if what is believed is also done.</p>
<p>8. You call yourself wealthy and rich; but Paul meets your riches, and with his own voice
prescribes for the moderating of your dress and ornament within a just limit. “Let women,”
said he, “adorn themselves with shamefacedness and sobriety, not with broidered hair, nor

gold, nor pearls, nor costly array, but as becometh women professing chastity, with a good
conversation.”3193 Also Peter consents to these same precepts, and says, “Let there be in the
woman not the outward adorning of array, or gold, or apparel, but the adorning of the
heart.”3194 But if these also warn us that the women who are accustomed to make an excuse
for their dress by reference to their husband, should be restrained and limited by religious
observance to the Church’s discipline, how much more is it right that the virgin should keep
that observance, who has no excuse for adorning herself, nor can the deceitfulness of her
fault be laid upon another, but she herself remains in its guilt!</p>
<p>9. You say that you are wealthy and rich. But not everything that can be done ought
also to be done; nor ought the broad desires that arise out of the pride of the world to be
extended beyond the honour and modesty of virginity; since it is written, “All things are
lawful, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful, but all things edify not.”3195
For the rest, if you dress your hair sumptuously, and walk so as to draw attention in public,
and attract the eyes of youth upon you, and draw the sighs of young men after you, nourish
the lust of concupiscence, and inflame the fuel of sighs, so that, although you yourself perish
not, yet you cause others to perish, and offer yourself, as it were, a sword or poison to the
spectators; you cannot be excused on the pretence that you are chaste and modest in mind.
Your shameful dress and immodest ornament accuse you; nor can you be counted now
among Christ’s maidens and virgins, since you live in such a manner as to make yourselves
objects of desire.</p>
<p>10. You say that you are wealthy and rich; but it becomes not a virgin to boast of her
riches, since Holy Scripture says, “What hath pride profited us? or what benefit hath the
vaunting of riches conferred upon us? And all these things have passed away like a shadow.”
3196 And the apostle again warns us, and says, “And they that buy, as though they
bought not; and they that possess, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world,
as though they used it not. For the fashion of this world passeth away.”3197 Peter also, to
whom the Lord commends His sheep to be fed and guarded, on whom He placed and
founded the Church, says indeed that he has no silver and gold, but says that he is rich in
the grace of Christ—that he is wealthy in his faith and virtue—wherewith he performed
many great works with miracle, wherewith he abounded in spiritual blessings to the grace
of glory. These riches, this wealth, she cannot possess, who had rather be rich to this world
than to Christ.</p>

<p>11. You say that you are wealthy and rich, and you think that you should use those
things which God has willed you to possess. Use them, certainly, but for the things of salvation;
use them, but for good purposes; use them, but for those things which God has commanded,
and which the Lord has set forth. Let the poor feel that you are wealthy; let the
needy feel that you are rich. Lend your estate to God; give food to Christ. Move Him by the
prayers of many3198 to grant you to carry out the glory of virginity, and to succeed in coming
to the Lord’s rewards. There entrust your treasures, where no thief digs through, where no
insidious plunderer breaks in. Prepare for yourself possessions; but let them rather be
heavenly ones, where neither rust wears out, nor hail bruises, nor sun burns, nor rain spoils
your fruits constant and perennial, and free from all contact of worldly injury. For in this
very matter you are sinning against God, if you think that riches were given you by Him for
this purpose, to enjoy them thoroughly, without a view to salvation. For God gave man also
a voice; and yet love-songs and indecent things are not on that account to be sung. And
God willed iron to be for the culture of the earth, but not on that account must murders be
committed. Or because God ordained incense, and wine, and fire, are we thence to sacrifice
to idols? Or because the flocks of cattle abound in your fields, ought you to immolate victims
and offerings to the gods? Otherwise a large estate is a temptation, unless the wealth minister
to good uses; so that every man, in proportion to his wealth, ought by his patrimony rather
to redeem his transgressions than to increase them.</p>
<p>12. The characteristics of ornaments, and of garments, and the allurements of beauty,
are not fitting for any but prostitutes and immodest women; and the dress of none is more
precious than of those whose modesty is lowly.3199 Thus in the Holy Scriptures, by which
the Lord wished us to be both instructed and admonished, the harlot city is described more
beautifully arrayed and adorned, and with her ornaments; and the rather on account of
those very ornaments about to perish. “And there came,” it is said, “one of the seven angels,
which had the seven phials, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the
judgment of the great whore, that sitteth upon many waters, with whom the kings of the
earth have committed fornication. And he carried me away in spirit; and I saw a woman sit
upon a beast, and that woman was arrayed in a purple and scarlet mantle, and was adorned
with gold, and precious stones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of curses,
and filthiness, and fornication of the whole earth.”3200 Let chaste and modest virgins avoid

God will grant her the glory of virginity. [Luke xvi. 9.]

speaking, more expensive than the dress of those whose modesty is cheap;” i.e., who have no modesty at all, or
very little.</note>

the dress of the unchaste, the manners of the immodest, the ensigns of brothels, the ornaments
of harlots.</p>
<p>13. Moreover Isaiah, full of the Holy Spirit, cries out and chides the daughters of Sion,
corrupted with gold, and silver, and raiment, and rebukes them, affluent as they were in
pernicious wealth, and departing from God for the sake of the world’s delights. “The
daughters of Sion,” says he, “are haughty, and walk with stretched-out neck and beckoning
of the eyes, trailing their gowns as they go, and mincing with their feet. And God will humble
the princely daughters of Sion, and the Lord will unveil their dress; and the Lord will take
away the glory of their apparel, and their ornaments, and their hair, and their curls, and
their round tires like the moon, and their crisping-pins, and their bracelets, and their clusters
of pearls, and their armlets and rings, and earrings, and silks woven with gold and hyacinth.
And instead of a sweet smell there shall be dust; and thou shalt be girt with a rope instead
of with a girdle; and for a golden ornament of thy head thou shalt have baldness.”3201 This
God blames, this He marks out: hence He declares that virgins are corrupted; hence, that
they have departed from the true and divine worship. Lifted up, they have fallen; with their
heads adorned, they merited dishonour and disgrace. Having put on silk and purple, they
cannot put on Christ; adorned with gold, and pearls, and necklaces, they have lost the ornaments
of the heart and spirit. Who would not execrate and avoid that which has been the
destruction of another? Who would desire and take up that which has served as the sword
and weapon for the death of another? If he who had drunk should die by draining the cup,
you would know that what he had drunk was poison; if, on taking food, he who had taken
it were to perish, you would know that what, when taken could kill, was deadly; nor would
you eat or drink of that whence you had before seen that others had perished. Now what
ignorance of truth is it, what madness of mind, to wish for that which both has hurt and
always will hurt and to think that you yourself will not perish by those means whereby you
know that others have perished!</p>
<p>14. For God neither made the sheep scarlet or purple, nor taught the juices of herbs and
shell-fish to dye and colour wool, nor arranged necklaces with stones set in gold, and with
pearls distributed in a woven series or numerous cluster, wherewith you would hide the
neck which He made; that what God formed in man may be covered, and that may be seen
upon it which the devil has invented in addition. Has God willed that wounds should be
made in the ears, wherewith infancy, as yet innocent, and unconscious of worldly evil, may
be put to pain, that subsequently from the scars and holes of the ears precious beads may
hang, heavy, if not by their weight, still by the amount of their cost? All which things sinning
and apostate angels put forth by their arts, when, lowered to the contagious of earth, they
forsook their heavenly vigour. They taught them also to paint the eyes with blackness drawn
<note type="footnote">3201 Isa. iii. 16.</note>

<pb n="1017"/>
round them in a circle, and to stain the cheeks with a deceitful red, and to change the hair
with false colours, and to drive out all truth, both of face and head, by the assault of their
own corruption.</p>
<p>15. And indeed in that very matter, for the sake of the fear which faith suggests to me,
for the sake of the love which brotherhood requires, I think that not virgins only and widows,
but married women also, and all of the sex alike, should be admonished, that the work of
God and His fashioning and formation ought in no manner to be adulterated, either with
the application of yellow colour, or with black dust or rouge, or with any kind of medicament
which can corrupt the native lineaments. God says, “Let us make man in our image and
likeness;”3202 and does any one dare to alter and to change what God has made? They are
laying hands on God when they try to re-form that which He formed, and to transfigure it,
not knowing that everything which comes into being is God’s work, everything that is
changed is the devil’s. If any artist, in painting, were to delineate in envious colouring the
countenance and likeness and bodily appearance of any one; and the likeness being now
painted and completed, another person were to lay hands on it, as if, when it was already
formed and already painted, he, being more skilled, could amend it, a serious wrong and a
just cause of indignation would seem natural to the former artist. And do you think yourself
likely with impunity to commit a boldness of such wicked temerity, an offence to God the
artificer? For although you may not be immodest among men, and are not unchaste with
your seducing dyes, yet when those things which belong to God are corrupted and violated,
you are engaged in a worse adultery. That you think yourself to be adorned, that you think
your hair to be dressed, is an assault upon the divine work, is a prevarication of the truth.</p>
<p>16. The voice of the warning apostle is, “Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new
lump, as ye are unleavened; for even Christ our passover is sacrificed. Therefore let us keep
the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with
the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.”3203 But are sincerity and truth preserved, when
what is sincere is polluted by adulterous colours, and what is true is changed into a lie by
the deceitful dyes of medicaments? Your Lord says, “Thou canst not make one hair white
or black;”3204 and you, in order to overcome the word of your Lord, will be more mighty
than He, and stain your hair with a daring endeavour and with profane contempt. With evil
presage of the future, you make a beginning to yourself already of flame-coloured hair; and
sin (oh, wickedness!) with your head—that is, with the nobler part of your body! And although
it is written of the Lord, “His head and His hair were white like wool or snow,”3205
you curse that whiteness and hate that hoariness which is like to the Lord’s head.</p>

<p>17. Are you not afraid, I entreat you, being such as you are, that when the day of resurrection
comes, your Maker may not recognise you again, and may turn you away when you
come to His rewards and promises, and may exclude you, rebuking you with the vigour of
a Censor and Judge, and say: “This is not my work, nor is this our image. You have polluted
your skin with a false medicament, you have changed your hair with an adulterous colour,
your face is violently taken possession of by a lie, your figure is corrupted, your countenance
is another’s. You cannot see God, since your eyes are not those which God made, but those
which the devil has spoiled. You have followed him, you have imitated the red and painted
eyes of the serpent. As you are adorned in the fashion of your enemy, with him also you
shall burn by and by.” Are not these, I beg, matters to be reflected on by God’s servants?
Are they not always to be dreaded day and night? Let married women see to it, in what respect
they are flattering themselves concerning the solace of their husbands with the desire of
pleasing them, and while they put them forward indeed as their excuse, they make them
partners in the association of guilty consent. Virgins, assuredly, to whom this address is intended
to appeal, who have adorned themselves with arts of this kind, I should think ought
not to be counted among virgins, but, like infected sheep and diseased cattle, to be driven
from the holy and pure flock of virginity, lest by living together they should pollute the rest
with their contagion; lest they ruin others even as they have perished themselves.</p>
<p>18. And since we are seeking the advantage of continency, let us also avoid everything
that is pernicious and hostile to it. And I will not pass over those things, which while by
negligence they come into use, have made for themselves a usurped licence, contrary to
modest and sober manners. Some are not ashamed to be present at marriage parties, and
in that freedom of lascivious discourse to mingle in unchaste conversation, to hear what is
not becoming, to say what is not lawful, to expose themselves, to be present in the midst of
disgraceful words and drunken banquets, by which the ardour of lust is kindled, and the
bride is animated to bear, and the bridegroom to dare lewdness.3206 What place is there at
weddings for her whose mind is not towards marriage? Or what can there be pleasant or
joyous in those engagements for her, where both desires and wishes are different from her
own? What is learnt there—what is seen? How greatly a virgin falls short of her resolution,
when she who had come there modest goes away immodest! Although she may remain a
virgin in body and mind, yet in eyes, in ears, in tongue, she has diminished the virtues that
she possessed.</p>
<p>19. But what of those who frequent promiscuous baths; who prostitute to eyes that are
curious to lust, bodies that are dedicated to chastity and modesty? They who disgracefully
behold naked men, and are seen naked by men, do they not themselves afford enticement
<note type="footnote">3206 [The utterly intolerable paganism here exposed, and fully sustained by Martial and other Latin poets,
accounts for much of the discipline of the early Church, and its excessive laudations of virginity.]</note>

<pb n="1019"/>
to vice, do they not solicit and invite the desires of those present to their own corruption
and wrong? “Let every one,” say you, “look to the disposition with which he comes thither:
my care is only that of refreshing and washing my poor body.” That kind of defence does
not clear you, nor does it excuse the crime of lasciviousness and wantonness. Such a washing
defiles; it does not purify nor cleanse the limbs, but stains them. You behold no one immodestly,
but you yourself are gazed upon immodestly. You do not pollute your eyes with disgraceful
delight, but in delighting others you yourself are polluted. You make a show of the
bathing-place; the places where you assemble are fouler than a theatre. There all modesty
is put off together with the clothing of garments, the honour and modesty of the body is
laid aside; virginity is exposed, to be pointed at and to be handled. And now, then, consider
whether when you are clothed you are modest among men, when the boldness of nakedness
has conduced to immodesty.</p>
<p>20. For this reason, therefore, the Church frequently mourns over her virgins; hence
she groans at their scandalous and detestable stories; hence the flower of her virgins is extinguished,
the honour and modesty of continency are injured, and all its glory and dignity
are profaned. Thus the hostile besieger insinuates himself by his arts; thus by snares that
deceive, by secret ways, the devil creeps in. Thus, while virgins wish to be more carefully
adorned, and to wander with more liberty, they cease to be virgins, corrupted by a furtive
dishonour; widows before they are married, adulterous, not to their husband, but to Christ.
In proportion as they had been as virgins destined to great rewards, so will they experience
great punishments for the loss of their virginity.</p>
<p>21. Therefore hear me, O virgins, as a parent; hear, I beseech you, one who fears while
he warns; hear one who is faithfully consulting for your advantage and your profit. Be such
as God the Creator made you; be such as the hand of your Father ordained you. Let your
countenance remain in you incorrupt, your neck unadorned, your figure simple; let not
wounds be made in your ears, nor let the precious chain of bracelets and necklaces circle
your arms or your neck; let your feet be free from golden bands, your hair stained with no
dye, your eyes worthy of beholding God. Let your baths be performed with women, among
whom your bathing is modest.3207 Let the shameless feasts and lascivious banquets of
marriages be avoided, the contagion of which is perilous. Overcome dress, since you are a
virgin; overcome gold, since you overcome the flesh and the world. It is not consistent to
be unable to be conquered by the greater, and to be found no match for the less. Strait and
narrow is the way which leadeth to life; hard and difficult is the track which tends to glory.

By this pathway the martyrs progress, the virgins pass, the just of all kinds advance. Avoid
the broad and roomy ways. There are deadly snares and death-bringing pleasures; there the
devil flatters, that he may deceive; smiles, that he may do mischief; entices, that he may slay.
The first fruit for the martyrs is a hundred-fold; the second is yours, sixty-fold. As with the
martyrs there is no thought of the flesh and of the world, no small, and trifling, and delicate
encounter; so also in you, whose reward is second in grace, let there be the strength in endurance
next to theirs. The ascent to great things is not easy. What toil we suffer, what labour,
when we endeavour to ascend the hills and the tops of mountains! What, then, that we may
ascend to heaven? If you look to the reward of the promise, your labour is less. Immortality
is given to the persevering, eternal life is set before them; the Lord promises a kingdom.</p>
<p>22. Hold fast, O virgins! hold fast what you have begun to be; hold fast what you shall
be. A great reward awaits you, a great recompense of virtue, the immense advantage of
chastity. Do you wish to know what ill the virtue of continence avoids, what good it possesses?
“I will multiply,” says God to the woman, “thy sorrows and thy groanings; and in sorrow
shalt thou bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
thee.”3208 You are free from this sentence. You do not fear the sorrows and the groans of
women. You have no fear of child-bearing; nor is your husband lord over you; but your
Lord and Head is Christ, after the likeness and in the place of the man; with that of men
your lot and your condition is equal. It is the word of the Lord which says, “The children
of this world beget and are begotten; but they who are counted worthy of that world, and
of the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage: neither shall
they die any more: for they are equal to the angels of God, being the children of the resurrection.”
3209 That which we shall be, you have already begun to be. You possess already in
this world the glory of the resurrection. You pass through the world without the contagion
of the world; in that you continue chaste and virgins, you are equal to the angels of God.
Only let your virginity remain and endure substantial and uninjured; and as it began bravely,
let it persevere continuously, and not seek the ornaments of necklaces nor garments, but of
conduct. Let it look towards God and heaven, and not lower to the lust of the flesh and of
the world, the eyes uplifted to things above, or set them upon earthly things.</p>
<p>23. The first decree commanded to increase and to multiply; the second enjoined continency.
While the world is still rough and void, we are propagated by the fruitful begetting
of numbers, and we increase to the enlargement of the human race. Now, when the world
is filled and the earth supplied, they who can receive continency, living after the manner of
eunuchs, are made eunuchs unto the kingdom. Nor does the Lord command this, but He
exhorts it; nor does He impose the yoke of necessity, since the free choice of the will is left.

But when He says that in His Father’s house are many mansions, He points out the dwellings
of the better habitation. Those better habitations you are seeking; cutting away the desires
of the flesh, you obtain the reward of a greater grace in the heavenly home. All indeed who
attain to the divine gift and inheritance by the sanctification of baptism, therein put off the
old man by the grace of the saving laver, and, renewed by the Holy Spirit from the filth of
the old contagion, are purged by a second nativity. But the greater holiness and truth of that
repeated birth belongs to you, who have no longer any desires of the flesh and of the body.
Only the things which belong to virtue and the Spirit have remained in you to glory. It is
the apostle’s word whom the Lord called His chosen vessel, whom God sent to proclaim the
heavenly command: “The first man,” says he, “is from the earth, of earth; the second man
is from heaven. Such as is the earthy, such are they also who are earthy; and such as is the
heavenly, such also are the heavenly. As we have borne the image of him who is earthy, let
us also bear the image of Him who is heavenly.”3210 Virginity bears this image, integrity
bears it, holiness bears it, and truth. Disciplines which are mindful of God bear it, retaining
righteousness with religion, stedfast in faith, humble in fear, brave to all suffering, meek to
sustain wrong, easy to show mercy, of one mind and one heart in fraternal peace.</p>
<p>24. Every one of which things, O good virgins, you ought to observe, to love, to fulfil,
who, giving yourselves to God and Christ, are advancing in both the higher and better part
to the Lord, to whom you have dedicated yourselves. You that are advanced in years, suggest
a teaching to the younger. You that are younger, give a stimulus to your coevals. Stir one
another up with mutual exhortations; provoke to glory by rival proofs of virtue. Endure
bravely, go on spiritually, attain happily. Only remember us at that time, when virginity
shall begin to be rewarded in you.</p>

seemed to incredulous people difficult, and to traitors impossible, our security is by divine
aid and retribution re-established. Our minds return to gladness; and the season of affliction
and the cloud being dispersed, tranquillity and serenity have shone forth once more. Praises
must be given to God, and His benefits and gifts must be celebrated with giving of thanks,
although even in the time of persecution our voice has not ceased to give thanks. For not

kisses, we embrace them long desired with insatiable eagerness. The white-robed cohort of
Christ’s soldiers is here, who in the fierce conflict have broken the ferocious turbulence of
an urgent persecution, having been prepared for the suffering of the dungeon, armed for
the endurance of death. Bravely you have resisted the world: you have afforded a glorious
spectacle in the sight of God; you have been an example to your brethren that shall follow
you. That religious voice has named the name of Christ, in whom it has once confessed that
it believed; those illustrious hands, which had only been accustomed to divine works, have
resisted the sacrilegious sacrifices; those lips, sanctified by heavenly food after the body and
blood of the Lord, have rejected the profane contacts and the leavings of the idols. Your
head has remained free from the impious and wicked veil3214 with which the captive heads
of those who sacrificed were there veiled; your brow, pure with the sign of God, could not
bear the crown of the devil, but reserved itself for the Lord’s crown. How joyously does your
Mother Church receive you in her bosom, as you return from the battle! How blissfully,
how gladly, does she open her gates, that in united bands you may enter, bearing the trophies
from a prostrate enemy! With the triumphing men come women also, who, while contending
with the world, have also overcome their sex; and virgins also come with the double glory
of their warfare, and boys transcending their years with their virtues.3215 Moreover, also,
the rest of the multitude of those who stand fast follow your glory, and accompany your
footsteps with the insignia of praise, very near to, and almost joined with, your own. In them
also is the same sincerity of heart, the same soundness of a tenacious faith. Resting on the
unshaken roots of the heavenly precepts, and strengthened by the evangelical traditions,
the prescribed banishment, the destined tortures, the loss of property, the bodily punishments,
have not terrified them. The days for proving their faith were limited beforehand; but he
who remembers that he has renounced the world knows no day of worldly appointment,
neither does he who hopes for eternity from God calculate the seasons of earth any more.</p>
<p>3. Let none, my beloved brethren, let none depreciate this glory; let none by malignant
dispraise detract from the uncorrupted stedfastness of those who have stood. When the day
appointed for denying was gone by, every one who had not professed within that time not
to be a Christian, confessed that he was a Christian. It is the first title to victory to confess
the Lord under the violence of the hands of the Gentiles. It is the second step to glory to be
withdrawn by a cautious retirement, and to be reserved for the Lord. The former is a public,
the latter is a private confession. The former overcomes the judge of this world; the latter,
content with God as its judge, keeps a pure conscience in integrity of heart. In the former
case there is a readier fortitude; in the latter, solicitude is more secure. The former, as his

hour approached, was already found mature; the latter perhaps was delayed, who, leaving
his estate, withdrew for a while, because he would not deny, but would certainly confess if
he too had been apprehended.</p>
<p>4. One cause of grief saddens these heavenly crowns of martyrs, these glorious spiritual
confessions, these very great and illustrious virtues of the brethren who stand; which is, that
the hostile violence has torn away a part of our own bowels, and thrown it away in the destructiveness
of its own cruelty. What shall I do in this matter, beloved brethren? Wavering
in the various tide of feeling, what or how shall I speak? I need tears rather than words to
express the sorrow with which the wound of our body should be bewailed, with which the
manifold loss of a people once numerous should be lamented. For whose heart is so hard
or cruel, who is so unmindful of brotherly love, as, among the varied ruins of his friends,
and the mournful relics disfigured with all degradation, to be able to stand and to keep dry
eyes, and not in the breaking out of his grief to express his groanings rather with tears than
with words? I grieve, brethren, I grieve with you; nor does my own integrity and my personal
soundness beguile me to the soothing of my griefs, since it is the shepherd that is chiefly
wounded in the wound of his flock. I join my breast with each one, and I share in the
grievous burden of sorrow and mourning. I wail with the wailing, I weep with the weeping,
I regard myself as prostrated with those that are prostrate. My limbs are at the same time
stricken with those darts of the raging enemy; their cruel swords have pierced through my
bowels; my mind could not remain untouched and free from the inroad of persecution
among my downfallen brethren; sympathy has cast me down also.</p>
<p>5. Yet, beloved brethren, the cause of truth is to be had in view; nor ought the gloomy
darkness of the terrible persecution so to have blinded the mind and feeling, that there
should remain no light and illumination whence the divine precepts may be beheld. If the
cause of disaster is recognised, there is at once found a remedy for the wound. The Lord
has desired His family to be proved; and because a long peace had corrupted the discipline3216
that had been divinely delivered to us, the heavenly rebuke has aroused our faith, which was
giving way, and I had almost said slumbering; and although we deserved3217 more for our
sins, yet the most merciful Lord has so moderated all things, that all which has happened
has rather seemed a trial than a persecution.</p>
<p>6. Each one was desirous of increasing his estate; and forgetful of what believers had
either done before in the times of the apostles, or always ought to do, they, with the insatiable
ardour of covetousness, devoted themselves to the increase of their property. Among the
priests there was no devotedness of religion; among the ministers3218 there was no sound

faith: in their works there was no mercy; in their manners there was no discipline. In men,
their beards were defaced;3219 in women, their complexion was dyed: the eyes were falsified
from what God’s hand had made them; their hair was stained with a falsehood. Crafty frauds
were used to deceive the hearts of the simple, subtle meanings for circumventing the brethren.
They united in the bond of marriage with unbelievers; they prostituted the members of
Christ to the Gentiles. They would swear not only rashly, but even more, would swear falsely;
would despise those set over them with haughty swelling, would speak evil of one another
with envenomed tongue, would quarrel with one another with obstinate hatred. Not a few
bishops3220 who ought to furnish both exhortation and example to others, despising their
divine charge, became agents in secular business, forsook their throne, deserted their people,
wandered about over foreign provinces, hunted the markets for gainful merchandise, while
brethren were starving in the Church.3221 They sought to possess money in hoards, they
seized estates by crafty deceits, they increased their gains by multiplying usuries. What do
not such as we deserve to suffer for sins of this kind, when even already the divine rebuke
has forewarned us, and said, “If they shall forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
if they shall profane my statutes, and shall not observe my precepts, I will visit their offences
with a rod, and their sins with scourges?”3222</p>
<p>7. These things were before declared to us, and predicted. But we, forgetful of the law
and obedience required of us, have so acted by our sins, that while we despise the Lord’s
commandments, we have come by severer remedies to the correction of our sin and probation
of our faith. Nor indeed have we at last been converted to the fear of the Lord, so as to un-
dergo patiently and courageously this our correction and divine proof. Immediately at the
first words of the threatening foe, the greatest number of the brethren betrayed their faith,
and were cast down, not by the onset of persecution, but cast themselves down by voluntary
lapse. What unheard-of thing, I beg of you, what new thing had happened, that, as if on the
occurrence of things unknown and unexpected, the obligation to3223 Christ should be dissolved
with headlong rashness? Have not prophets aforetime, and subsequently apostles,
told of these things? Have not they, full of the Holy Spirit, predicted the afflictions of the
righteous, and always the injuries of the heathens? Does not the sacred Scripture, which
ever arms our faith and strengthens with a voice from heaven the servants of God, say,
“Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve?”3224 Does it not

again show the anger of the divine indignation, and warn of the fear of punishment beforehand,
when it says, “They worshipped them whom their fingers have made; and the mean
man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself, and I will forgive them not?”3225
And again, God speaks, and says, “He that sacrifices unto any gods, save unto the Lord only,
shall be destroyed.”3226 In the Gospel also subsequently, the Lord, who instructs by His
words and fulfils by His deeds, teaching what should be done, and doing whatever He had
taught, did He not before admonish us of whatever is now done and shall be done? Did He
not before ordain both for those who deny Him eternal punishments, and for those that
confess Him saving rewards?</p>
<p>8. From some—ah, misery!—all these things have fallen away, and have passed from
memory. They indeed did not wait to be apprehended ere they ascended, or to be interrogated
ere they denied. Many were conquered before the battle, prostrated before the attack. Nor
did they even leave it to be said for them, that they seemed to sacrifice to idols unwillingly.
They ran to the market-place of their own accord; freely they hastened to death, as if they
had formerly wished it, as if they would embrace an opportunity now given which they had
always desired. How many were put off by the magistrates at that time, when evening was
coming on; how many even asked that their destruction might not be delayed! What violence
can such a one plead as an excuse? How can he purge his crime, when it was he himself who
rather used force to bring about his own ruin? When they came voluntarily to the Capitol,—
when they freely approached to the obedience of the terrible wickedness,—did not their
tread falter? Did not their sight darken, their heart tremble, their arms fall helplessly down?
Did not their senses fail, their tongue cleave to their mouth, their speech grow weak? Could
the servant of God stand there, and speak and renounce Christ, when he had already renounced
the devil and the world? Was not that altar, whither he drew near to perish, to him
a funeral pile? Ought he not to shudder at and flee from the devil’s altar, which he had seen
to smoke, and to be redolent of a foul foetor, as if it were the funeral and sepulchre of his
life? Why bring with you, O wretched man, a sacrifice? why immolate a victim? You yourself
have come to the altar an offering; you yourself have come a victim: there you have immolated
your salvation, your hope; there you have burnt up your faith in those deadly fires.3227</p>
<p>9. But to many their own destruction was not sufficient. With mutual exhortations,
people were urged to their ruin; death was pledged by turns in the deadly cup. And that
nothing might be wanting to aggravate the crime, infants also, in the arms of their parents,
either carried or conducted, lost, while yet little ones, what in the very first beginning of
their nativity they had gained.3228 Will not they, when the day of judgment comes, say, “We

have done nothing;3229 nor have we forsaken the Lord’s bread and cup to hasten freely to
a profane contact; the faithlessness of others has ruined us. We have found our parents our
murderers; they have denied to us the Church as a Mother; they have denied God as a
Father: so that, while we were little, and unforeseeing, and unconscious of such a crime, we
were associated by others to the partnership of wickedness, and we were snared by the deceit
of others?”</p>
<p>10. Nor is there, alas, any just and weighty reason which excuses such a crime. One’s
country was to be left, and loss of one’s estate was to be suffered. Yet to whom that is born
and dies is there not a necessity at some time to leave his country, and to suffer the loss of
his estate? But let not Christ be forsaken, so that the loss of salvation and of an eternal home
should be feared. Behold, the Holy Spirit cries by the prophet, “Depart ye, depart ye, go ye
out from thence, touch not the unclean thing; go ye out from the midst of her, and be ye
separate, that bear the vessels of the Lord.”3230 Yet those who are the vessels of the Lord
and the temple of God do not go out from the midst, nor depart, that they may not be
compelled to touch the unclean thing, and to be polluted and corrupted with deadly food.
Elsewhere also a voice is heard from heaven, forewarning what is becoming for the servants
of God to do, saying, “Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and
that ye receive not of her plagues.”3231 He who goes out and departs does not become a
partaker of the guilt; but he will be wounded with the plagues who is found a companion
in the crime. And therefore the Lord commanded us in the persecution to depart and to
flee; and both taught that this should be done, and Himself did it. For as the crown is given
of the condescension of God, and cannot be received unless the hour comes for accepting
it, whosoever abiding in Christ departs for a while does not deny his faith, but waits for the
time; but he who has fallen, after refusing to depart, remained to deny it.</p>
<p>11. The truth, brethren, must not be disguised; nor must the matter and cause of our
wound be concealed. A blind love of one’s own property has deceived many; nor could they
be prepared for, or at ease in, departing when their wealth fettered them like a chain. Those
were the chains to them that remained—those were the bonds by which both virtue was
retarded, and faith burdened, and the spirit bound, and the soul hindered; so that they who
were involved in earthly things3232 might become a booty and food for the serpent, which,
according to God’s sentence, feeds upon earth. And therefore the Lord the teacher of good
things, forewarning for the future time, says, “If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell all that thou
hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow
<note type="footnote">3229 Some read, “evil.”</note>

me.”3233 If rich men did this, they would not perish by their riches; if they laid up treasure
in heaven, they would not now have a domestic enemy and assailant. Heart and mind and
feeling would be in heaven, if the treasure were in heaven; nor could he be overcome by the
world who had nothing in the world whereby he could be overcome.3234 He would follow
the Lord loosed and free, as did the apostles, and many in the times of the apostles, and
many who forsook both their means and their relatives, and clave to Christ with undivided
ties.</p>
<p>12. But how can they follow Christ, who are held back by the chain of their wealth? Or
how can they seek heaven, and climb to sublime and lofty heights, who are weighed down
by earthly desires? They think that they possess, when they are rather possessed; as slaves
of their profit, and not lords with respect to their own money, but rather the bond-slaves
of their money. These times and these men are indicated by the apostle, when he says, “But
they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful
lusts, which drown men in destruction and in perdition. For the root of all evil is the love
of money, which, while some have coveted, they have erred3235 from the faith, and pierced
themselves through with many sorrows.”3236 But with what rewards does the Lord invite
us to contempt of worldly wealth? With what compensations does He atone for the small
and trifling losses of this present time? “There is no man,” saith He, “that leaves house, or
land, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake, but he
shall receive seven fold3237 even in this time, but in the world to come life everlasting.”3238
If we know these things, and have found them out from the truth of the Lord who promises,
not only is not loss of this kind to be feared, but even to be desired; as the Lord Himself
again announces and warns us, “Blessed are ye when men shall persecute you, and when
they shall separate you from their company, and shall cast you out, and shall speak of your
name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake! Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy; for, behold,
your reward is great in heaven.”3239</p>
<p>13. But (say they) subsequently tortures had come,3240 and severe sufferings were
threatening those who resisted. He may complain of tortures who has been overcome by
tortures; he may offer the excuse of suffering who has been vanquished in suffering. Such

a one may ask, and say, “I wished indeed to strive bravely, and, remembering my oath, I
took up the arms of devotion and faith; but as I was struggling in the encounter, varied
tortures and long-continued sufferings overcame me. My mind stood firm, and my faith
was strong, and my soul struggled long, unshaken with the torturing pains; but when, with
the renewed barbarity of the most cruel judge, wearied out as I was, the scourges were now
tearing me,3241 the clubs bruised me, the rack strained me, the claw dug into me, the fire
roasted me; my flesh deserted me in the struggle, the weakness of my bodily frame gave
way,—not my mind, but my body, yielded in the suffering.” Such a plea may readily avail
to forgiveness; an apology of that kind may excite compassion. Thus at one time the Lord
forgave Castus and Æmilius; thus, overcome in the first encounter, they were made victors
in the second battle. So that they who had formerly given way to the fires became stronger
than the fires, and in that in which they had been vanquished they were conquerors. They
entreated not for pity of their tears, but of their wounds; nor with a lamentable voice alone,
but with laceration and suffering of body. Blood flowed instead of weeping; and instead of
tears, gore poured forth from their half-scorched entrails.</p>
<p>14. But now, what wounds can those who are overcome show? what gashes of gaping
entrails, what tortures of the limbs, in cases where it was not faith that fell in the encounter,
but faithlessness that anticipated the struggle? Nor does the necessity of the crime excuse
the person compelled, where the crime is committed of free will. Nor do I say this in such
a way as that I would burden the cases of the brethren, but that I may rather instigate the
brethren to a prayer of atonement. For, as it is written, “They who call you happy cause you
to err, and destroy the paths of your feet,”3242 he who soothes the sinner with flattering
blandishments furnishes the stimulus to sin; nor does he repress, but nourishes wrong-doing.
But he who, with braver counsels, rebukes at the same time that he instructs a brother, urges
him onward to salvation. “As many as I love,” saith the Lord, “I rebuke and chasten.”3243
And thus also it behoves the Lord’s priest not to mislead by deceiving concessions, but to
provide with salutary remedies. He is an unskilful physician who handles the swelling edges
of wounds with a tender hand, and, by retaining the poison shut up in the deep recesses of
the body, increases it. The wound must be opened, and cut, and healed by the stronger
remedy of cutting out the corrupting parts. The sick man may cry out, may vociferate, and
may complain, in impatience of the pain; but he will afterwards give thanks when he has
felt that he is cured.</p>
<p>15. Moreover, beloved brethren, a new kind of devastation has appeared; and, as if the
storm of persecution had raged too little, there has been added to the heap, under the title

<pb n="1030"/>
of mercy, a deceiving mischief and a fair-seeming calamity. Contrary to the vigour of the
Gospel, contrary to the law of the Lord and God, by the temerity of some, communion is
relaxed to heedless persons,—a vain and false peace, dangerous to those who grant it, and
likely to avail nothing to those who receive it. They do not seek for the patience necessary
to health nor the true medicine derived from atonement. Penitence is driven forth from
their breasts, and the memory of their very grave and extreme sin is taken away. The wounds
of the dying are covered over, and the deadly blow that is planted in the deep and secret
entrails is concealed by a dissimulated suffering. Returning from the altars of the devil, they
draw near to the holy place of the Lord, with hands filthy and reeking with smell, still almost
breathing of the plague-bearing idol-meats; and even with jaws still exhaling their crime,
and reeking with the fatal contact, they intrude on the body of the Lord, although the sacred
Scripture stands in their way, and cries, saying, “Every one that is clean shall eat of the flesh;
and whatever soul eateth of the flesh of the saving sacrifice, which is the Lord’s, having his
uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.”3244 Also, the apostle
testifies, and says, “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils; ye cannot be
partakers of the Lord’s table and of the table of devils.”3245 He threatens, moreover, the
stubborn and froward, and denounces them, saying, “Whosoever eateth the bread or drinketh
the cup of the Lord unworthily, is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.”3246</p>
<p>16. All these warnings being scorned and contemned,—before their sin is expiated, before
confession has been made of their crime, before their conscience has been purged by sacrifice
and by the hand of the priest,3247 before the offence of an angry and threatening Lord has
been appeased, violence is done to His body and blood; and they sin now against their Lord
more with their hand and mouth than when they denied their Lord. They think that that is
peace which some with deceiving words are blazoning forth:3248 that is not peace, but war;
and he is not joined to the Church who is separated from the Gospel. Why do they call an
injury a kindness? Why do they call impiety by the name of piety? Why do they hinder those
who ought to weep continually and to entreat their Lord, from the sorrowing of repentance,
and pretend to receive them to communion? This is the same kind of thing to the lapsed as
hail to the harvests; as the stormy star to the trees; as the destruction of pestilence to the
herds; as the raging tempest to shipping. They take away the consolation of eternal hope;
they overturn the tree from the roots; they creep on to a deadly contagion with their pestilent

words; they dash the ship on the rocks, so that it may not reach to the harbour. Such a facility
does not grant peace, but takes it away; nor does it give communion, but it hinders from
salvation. This is another persecution, and another temptation, by which the crafty enemy
still further assaults the lapsed; attacking them by a secret corruption, that their lamentation
may be hushed, that their grief may be silent, that the memory of their sin may pass away,
that the groaning of their heart may be repressed, that the weeping of their eyes may be
quenched; nor long and full penitence deprecate the Lord so grievously offended, although
it is written, “Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent.”3249</p>
<p>17. Let no one cheat himself, let no one deceive himself. The Lord alone can have mercy.
He alone can bestow pardon for sins which have been committed against Himself, who bare
our sins, who sorrowed for us, whom God delivered up for our sins. Man cannot be greater
than God, nor can a servant remit or forego by his indulgence what has been committed by
a greater crime against the Lord, lest to the person lapsed this be moreover added to his sin,
if he be ignorant that it is declared, “Cursed is the man that putteth his hope in man.”3250
The Lord must be besought. The Lord must be appeased by our atonement, who has said,
that him that denieth Him He will deny, who alone has received all judgment from His
Father. We believe, indeed, that the merits of martyrs and the works of the righteous are of
great avail with the Judge; but that will be when the day of judgment shall come;3251 when,
after the conclusion of this life and the world, His people shall stand before the tribunal of
Christ.</p>
<p>18. But if any one, by an overhurried haste, rashly thinks that he can give remission of
sins to all,3252 or dares to rescind the Lord’s precepts, not only does it in no respect advantage
the lapsed, but it does them harm. Not to have observed His judgment is to have provoked
His wrath, and to think that the mercy of God must not first of all be entreated, and, despising
the Lord, to presume on His power.3253 Under the altar of God the souls of the slain martyrs
cry with a loud voice, saying, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and
avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?”3254 And they are bidden to rest, and
still to keep patience. And does any one think that, in opposition to the Judge, a man can
become of avail3255 for the general remission and pardon of sins, or that he can shield others

before he himself is vindicated? The martyrs order something to be done;3256 but only if
this thing be just and lawful, if it can be done without opposing the Lord Himself by God’s
priest, if the consent of the obeying party be easy and yielding, if the moderation of the
asking party be religious. The martyrs order something to be done; but if what they order
be not written in the law of the Lord, we must first know that they have obtained what they
ask from God, and then do what they command. For that may not always appear to be immediately
conceded by the divine majesty, which has been promised by man’s undertaking.</p>
<p>19. For Moses also besought for the sins of the people; and yet, when he had sought
pardon for these sinners, he did not receive it. “I pray Thee,” said he, “O Lord, this people
have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive
their sin, forgive it; but if not, blot me out of the book which Thou hast written. And the
Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my
book.”3257 He, the friend of God; he who had often spoken face to face with the Lord, could
not obtain what he asked, nor could appease the wrath of an indignant God by his entreaty.
God praises Jeremiah, and announces, saying, “Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew
thee; and before thou camest out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a
prophet unto the nations.”3258 And to the same man He saith, when he often entreated and
prayed for the sins of the people, “Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time wherein they call on me, in the time of
their affliction.”3259 But who was more righteous than Noah, who, when the earth was filled
with sins, was alone found righteous on the earth? Who more glorious than Daniel? Who
more strong for suffering martyrdom in firmness of faith, more happy in God’s condescension,
who so many times, both when he was in conflict conquered, and, when he had
conquered, lived on? Was any more ready in good works than Job, braver in temptations,
more patient in sufferings, more submissive in his fear, more true in his faith? And yet God
said that He would not grant to them if they were to seek. When the prophet Ezekiel entreated
for the sin of the people, “Whatsoever land,” said He, “shall sin against me by trespassing
grievously, I will stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of bread thereof,
and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it. Though these three
men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; but

pre-judgment of the asker, but in the free will of the giver; neither can human judgment
claim to itself or usurp anything, unless the divine pleasure approve.</p>
<p>20. In the Gospel the Lord speaks, and says, “Whosoever shall confess me before men,
him will I also confess before my Father which is in heaven: but he that denieth me, him
will I also deny.”3261 If He does not deny him that denies, neither does He confess him that
confesses; the Gospel cannot be sound in one part and waver in another. Either both must
stand firm, or both must lose the force of truth. If they who deny shall not be guilty of a
crime, neither shall they who confess receive the reward of a virtue. Again, if faith which
has conquered be crowned, it is of necessity that faithlessness which is conquered should
be punished. Thus the martyrs can either do nothing if the Gospel may be broken; or if the
Gospel cannot be broken, they can do nothing against the Gospel, since they become martyrs
on account of the Gospel. Let no one, beloved brethren, let no one decry the dignity of
martyrs, let no one degrade their glories and their crowns. The strength of their uncorrupted
faith abides sound; nor can he either say or do anything against Christ, whose hope, and
faith, and virtue, and glory, are all in Christ: those cannot be the authority for the bishops
doing anything against God’s command, who themselves have done God’s command. Is
any one greater than God, or more merciful than God’s goodness, that he should either wish
that undone which God has suffered to be done, or, as if God had too little power to protect
His Church, should think that we could be preserved by his help?</p>
<p>21. Unless, perchance, these things have been done without God’s knowledge, or all
these things have happened without His permission; although Holy Scripture teaches the
indocile, and admonishes the unmindful, where it speaks, saying, “Who gave Jacob for a
spoil, and Israel to those who made a booty of him? Did not the Lord against whom they
sinned, and would not walk in His ways, neither were obedient unto His law? And He has
poured upon them the fury of His anger.”3262 And elsewhere it testifies and says, “Is the
Lord’s hand shortened, that it cannot save; or His ear heavy, that it cannot hear? But your
iniquities separate between you and your God; and because of your sins He hath hid His
face from you, that He may not have mercy.”3263 Let us rather consider our offences, revolving
our doings and the secrets of our mind; let us weigh the deserts of our conscience;
let it come back upon our heart that we have not walked in the Lord’s ways, and have cast
away God’s law, and have never been willing to keep His precepts and saving counsels.</p>
<p>22. What good can you think of him, what fear can you suppose to have been with him,
or what faith, whom neither fear could correct nor persecution itself could reform? His high
and rigid neck, even when it has fallen, is unbent; his swelling and haughty soul is not broken,

even when it is conquered. Prostrate, he threatens those who stand; and wounded, the sound.
And because he may not at once receive the body of the Lord in his polluted hands, the
sacrilegious one is angry with the priests. And—oh your excessive madness, O frantic
one—you are angry with him who endeavours to avert the anger of God from you; you
threaten him who beseeches the divine mercy on your behalf, who feels your wound which
you yourself do not feel, who sheds tears for you, which perhaps you never shed yourself.
You are still aggravating and enhancing your crime; and while you yourself are implacable3264
against the ministers and priests3265 of God, do you think that the Lord can be appeased
concerning you?</p>
<p>23. Receive rather, and admit what we say. Why do your deaf ears not hear the salutary
precepts with which we warn you? Why do your blind eyes not see the way of repentance
which we point out? Why does your stricken and alienated mind not perceive the lively
remedies which we both learn and teach from the heavenly Scriptures?3266 Or if some unbelievers
have little faith in future events, let them be terrified with present ones. Lo, what
punishments do we behold of those who have denied! what sad deaths of theirs do we bewail!
Not even here can they be without punishment, although the day of punishment has not
yet arrived. Some are punished in the meantime, that others may be corrected. The torments
of a few are the examples of all.</p>
<p>24. One of those who of his own will ascended the Capitol to make denial, after he had
denied Christ, became dumb. The punishment began from that point whence the crime
also began;3267 so that now he could not ask, since he had no words for entreating mercy.3268
Another, who was in the baths, (for this was wanting to her crime and to her misfortunes,
that she even went at once to the baths, when she had lost the grace of the laver of life);
there, unclean as she was, was seized by an unclean spirit,3269 and tore with her teeth the
tongue with which she had either impiously eaten or spoken. After the wicked food had
been taken, the madness of the mouth was armed to its own destruction. She herself was
her own executioner, nor did she long continue to live afterwards: tortured with pangs of
the belly and bowels, she expired.</p>

<p>25. Learn what occurred when I myself was present and a witness.3270 Some parents
who by chance were escaping, being little careful3271 on account of their terror, left a little
daughter under the care of a wet-nurse. The nurse gave up the forsaken child to the magistrates.
They gave it, in the presence of an idol whither the people flocked (because it was
not yet able to eat flesh on account of its years), bread mingled with wine, which however
itself was the remainder of what had been used in the immolation of those that had perished.
Subsequently the mother recovered her child. But the girl was no more able to speak, or to
indicate the crime that had been committed, than she had before been able to understand
or to prevent it. Therefore it happened unawares in their ignorance, that when we were
sacrificing, the mother brought it in with her. Moreover, the girl mingled with the saints,
became impatient of our prayer and supplications, and was at one moment shaken with
weeping, and at another tossed about like a wave of the sea by the violent excitement of her
mind; as if by the compulsion of a torturer the soul of that still tender child confessed a
consciousness of the fact with such signs as it could. When, however, the solemnities were
finished, and the deacon began to offer the cup to those present, and when, as the rest received
it, its turn approached, the little child, by the instinct of the divine majesty, turned away its
face, compressed its mouth with resisting lips, and refused the cup.3272 Still the deacon
persisted, and, although against her efforts, forced on her some of the sacrament of the cup.
Then there followed a sobbing and vomiting. In a profane body and mouth the Eucharist
could not remain; the draught sanctified in the blood of the Lord burst forth from the polluted
stomach. So great is the Lord’s power, so great is His majesty. The secrets of darkness were
disclosed under His light, and not even hidden crimes deceived God’s priest.</p>
<p>26. This much about an infant, which was not yet of an age to speak of the crime committed
by others in respect of herself. But the woman who in advanced life and of more
mature age secretly crept in among us when we were sacrificing, received not food, but a
sword for herself; and as if taking some deadly poison3273 into her jaws and body, began
presently to be tortured, and to become stiffened with frenzy; and suffering the misery no
longer of persecution, but of her crime, shivering and trembling, she fell down. The crime
of her dissimulated conscience was not long unpunished or concealed. She who had deceived
man, felt that God was taking vengeance. And another woman, when she tried with unworthy

hands to open her box,3274 in which was the holy (body) of the Lord, was deterred by fire
rising from it from daring to touch it. And when one,3275 who himself was defiled, dared
with the rest to receive secretly a part of the sacrifice celebrated by the priest; he could not
eat nor handle the holy of the Lord, but found in his hands3276 when opened that he had a
cinder. Thus by the experience of one it was shown that the Lord withdraws when He is
denied; nor does that which is received benefit the undeserving for salvation, since saving
grace is changed by the departure of the sanctity into a cinder. How many there are daily
who do not repent nor make confession of the consciousness of their crime, who are filled
with unclean spirits!3277 How many are shaken even to unsoundness of mind and idiotcy
by the raging of madness! Nor is there any need to go through the deaths of individuals,
since through the manifold lapses occurring in the world the punishment of their sins is as
varied as the multitude of sinners is abundant. Let each one consider not what another has
suffered, but what he himself deserves to suffer; nor think that he has escaped if his punishment
delay for a time, since he ought to fear it the more that the wrath of God the judge has
reserved it for Himself.</p>
<p>27. Nor let those persons flatter themselves that they need repent the less, who, although
they have not polluted their hands with abominable sacrifices, yet have defiled their conscience
with certificates.3278 That profession of one who denies, is the testimony of a
Christian disowning what he had been. He says that he has done what another has actually
committed; and although it is written, “Ye cannot serve two masters,”3279 he has served an
earthly master in that he has obeyed his edict; he has been more obedient to human authority
than to God. It matters not whether he has published what he has done with less either of
disgrace or of guilt among men. Be that as it may, he will not be able to escape and avoid
God his judge, seeing that the Holy Spirit says in the Psalms, “Thine eyes did see my substance,
that it was imperfect, and in Thy book shall all men be written.”3280 And again: “Man
seeth the outward appearance, but God seeth the heart.”3281 The Lord Himself also forewarns

and prepares us, saying, “And all the churches shall know that I am He which searcheth the
reins and the heart.”3282 He looks into the hidden and secret things, and considers those
things which are concealed; nor can any one evade the eyes of the Lord, who says, “I am a
God at hand, and not a God afar off. If a man be hidden in secret places, shall not I therefore
see him? Do not I fill heaven and earth?”3283 He sees the heart and mind of every person;
and He will judge not alone of our deeds, but even of our words and thoughts. He looks
into the minds, and the wills, and conceptions of all men, in the very lurking-places of the
heart that is still closed up.</p>
<p>28. Moreover, how much are they both greater in faith and better in their fear, who, although
bound by no crime of sacrifice to idols or of certificate, yet, since they have even
thought of such things, with grief and simplicity confess this very thing to God’s priests,
and make the conscientious avowal, put off from them the load of their minds, and seek out
the salutary medicine even for slight and moderate wounds, knowing that it is written, “God
is not mocked.”3284 God cannot be mocked, nor deceived, nor deluded by any deceptive
cunning. Yea, he sins the more, who, thinking that God is like man, believes that he evades
the penalty of his crime if he has not openly admitted his crime. Christ says in His precepts,
“Whosoever shall be ashamed of me, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed.”3285 And
does he think that he is a Christian, who is either ashamed or afraid to be a Christian? How
can he be one with Christ, who either blushes or fears to belong to Christ? He will certainly
have sinned less, by not seeing the idols, and not profaning the sanctity of the faith under
the eyes of a people standing round and insulting, and not polluting his hands by the deadly
sacrifices, nor defiling his lips with the wicked food. This is advantageous to this extent,
that the fault is less, not that the conscience is guiltless. He can more easily attain to pardon
of his crime, yet he is not free from crime; and let him not cease to carry out his repentance,
and to entreat the Lord’s mercy, lest what seems to be less in the quality of his fault, should
be increased by his neglect of atonement.</p>
<p>29. I entreat you, beloved brethren, that each one should confess his own sin, while he
who has sinned is still in this world, while his confession may be received, while the satisfaction
and remission made by the priests are pleasing to the Lord.3286 Let us turn to the Lord
with our whole heart, and, expressing our repentance for our sin with true grief, let us entreat
God’s mercy. Let our soul lie low before Him. Let our mourning atone to Him. Let all our
hope lean upon Him. He Himself tells us in what manner we ought to ask. “Turn ye,” He

says, “to me with all your heart, and at the same time with fasting, and with weeping, and
with mourning; and rend your hearts, and not your garments.”3287 Let us return to the Lord
with our whole heart. Let us appease His wrath and indignation with fastings, with weeping,
with mourning, as He Himself admonishes us.</p>
<p>30. Do we believe that a man is lamenting with his whole heart, that he is entreating the
Lord with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning, who from the first day of his sin
daily frequents the bathing-places with women; who, feeding at rich banquets, and puffed
out with fuller dainties, belches forth on the next day his indigestions, and does not dispense
of his meat and drink so as to aid the necessity of the poor? How does he who walks with
joyous and glad step mourn for his death? And although it is written, “Ye shall not mar the
figure of your beard,”3288 he plucks out his beard, and dresses his hair; and does he now
study to please any one who displeases God? Or does she groan and lament who has time
to put on the clothing of precious apparel, and not to consider the robe of Christ which she
has lost; to receive valuable ornaments and richly wrought necklaces, and not to bewail the
loss of divine and heavenly ornament? Although thou clothest thyself in foreign garments
and silken robes, thou art naked; although thou adornest thyself to excess both in pearls,
and gems, and gold, yet without the adornment of Christ thou art unsightly. And you who
stain your hair, now at least cease in the midst of sorrows; and you who paint the edges of
your eyes with a line drawn around them of black powder, now at least wash your eyes with
tears. If you had lost any dear one of your friends by the death incident to mortality, you
would groan grievously, and weep with disordered countenance, with changed dress, with
neglected hair, with clouded face, with dejected appearance, you would show the signs of
grief. Miserable creature, you have lost your soul; spiritually dead here, you are continuing
to live to yourself, and although yourself walking about, you have begun to carry your own
death with you. And do you not bitterly moan; do you not continually groan; do you not
hide yourself, either for shame of your sin or for continuance of your lamentation? Behold,
these are still worse wounds of sinning; behold, these are greater crimes—to have sinned,
and not to make atonement—to have committed crimes, and not to bewail your crimes.</p>
<p>31. Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, the illustrious and noble youths, even amid the flames
and the ardours of a raging furnace, did not desist from making public confession to God.
Although possessed of a good conscience, and having often deserved well of the Lord by
obedience of faith and fear, yet they did not cease from maintaining their humility, and
from making atonement to the Lord, even amid the glorious martyrdoms of their virtues.
The sacred Scripture speaks, saying, “Azarias stood up and prayed, and, opening his mouth,
made confession before God together with his companions in the midst of the fire.”3289

Daniel also, after the manifold grace of his faith and innocency, after the condescension of
the Lord often repeated in respect of his virtues and praises, strives by fastings still further
to deserve well of God, wraps himself in sackcloth and ashes, sorrowfully making confession,
and saying, “O Lord God, great, and strong, and dreadful, keeping Thy covenant and mercy
for them that love Thee and keep Thy commandments, we have sinned, we have committed
iniquity, and have done wickedly: we have transgressed, and departed from Thy precepts,
and from Thy judgments; neither have we hearkened to the words of Thy servants the
prophets, which they spake in Thy name to our kings, and to all the nations, and to all the
earth. O Lord, righteousness3290 belongs unto Thee, but unto us confusion.”3291</p>
<p>32. These things were done by men, meek, simple, innocent, in deserving well of the
majesty of God; and now those who have denied the Lord refuse to make atonement to the
Lord, and to entreat Him. I beg you, brethren, acquiesce in wholesome remedies, obey better
counsels, associate your tears with our tears, join your groans with ours; we beseech you in
order that we may beseech God for you: we turn our very prayers to you first; our prayers
with which we pray3292 God for you that He would pity you. Repent abundantly, prove the
sorrow of a grieving and lamenting mind.</p>
<p>33. Neither let that imprudent error or vain stupor of some move you, who, although
they are involved in so grave a crime, are struck with blindness of mind, so that they neither
understand nor lament their sins. This is the greater visitation of an angry God; as it is
written, “And God gave them the spirit of deadness.”3293 And again: “They received not
the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them the
working of error, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed
not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”3294 Unrighteously pleasing themselves,
and mad with the alienation of a hardened mind, they despise the Lord’s precepts, neglect
the medicine for their wound, and will not repent. Thoughtless before their sin was acknowledged,
after their sin they are obstinate; neither stedfast before, nor suppliant afterwards:
when they ought to have stood fast, they fell; when they ought to fall and prostrate themselves
to God, they think they stand fast. They have taken peace for themselves of their own accord
when nobody granted it; seduced by false promises, and linked with apostates and unbelievers,
they take hold of error instead of truth: they regard a communion as valid with those who
are not communicants; they believe men against God, although they have not believed God
against men.</p>

<p>34. Flee from such men as much as you can; avoid with a wholesome caution those who
adhere to their mischievous contact. Their word doth eat as doth a cancer;3295 their conversation
advances like a contagion; their noxious and envenomed persuasion kills worse than
persecution itself. In such a case there remains only penitence which can make atonement.
But they who take away repentance for a crime, close the way of atonement. Thus it happens
that, while by the rashness of some a false safety is either promised or trusted, the hope of
true safety is taken away.</p>
<p>35. But you, beloved brethren, whose fear is ready towards God, and whose mind, although
it is placed in the midst of lapse, is mindful of its misery, do you in repentance and
grief look into your sins; acknowledge the very grave sin of your conscience; open the eyes
of your heart to the understanding of your sin, neither despairing of the Lord’s mercy nor
yet at once claiming His pardon. God, in proportion as with the affection of a Father He is
always indulgent and good, in the same proportion is to be dreaded with the majesty of a
judge. Even as we have sinned greatly, so let us greatly lament. To a deep wound let there
not be wanting a long and careful treatment; let not the repentance be less than the sin.
Think you that the Lord can be quickly appeased, whom with faithless words you have
denied, to whom you have rather preferred your worldly estate, whose temple you have violated
with a sacrilegious contact? Think you that He will easily have mercy upon you whom
you have declared not to be your God? You must pray more eagerly and entreat; you must
spend the day in grief; wear out nights in watchings and weepings; occupy all your time in
wailful lamentations; lying stretched on the ground, you must cling close to the ashes, be
surrounded with sackcloth and filth; after losing the raiment of Christ, you must be willing
now to have no clothing; after the devil’s meat, you must prefer fasting; be earnest in righteous
works, whereby sins may be purged; frequently apply yourself to almsgiving, whereby souls
are freed from death.3296 What the adversary took from you, let Christ receive; nor ought
your estate now either to be held or loved, by which you have been both deceived and
conquered. Wealth must be avoided as an enemy; must be fled from as a robber; must be
dreaded by its possessors as a sword and as poison.3297 To this end only so much as remains
should be of service, that by it the crime and the fault may be redeemed. Let good works be
done without delay, and largely; let all your estate be laid out for the healing of your wound;
let us lend of our wealth and our means to the Lord, who shall judge concerning us. Thus
faith flourished in the time of the apostles; thus the first people of believers kept Christ’s
commands: they were prompt, they were liberal, they gave their all to be distributed by the
apostles; and yet they were not redeeming sins of such a character as these.</p>

<p>36. If a man make prayer with his whole heart, if he groan with the true lamentations
and tears of repentance, if he incline the Lord to pardon of his sin by righteous and continual
works, he who expressed His mercy in these words may pity such men: “When you turn
and lament, then shall you be saved, and shall know where you have been.”3298 And again:
“I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord, but that he should return
and live.”3299 And Joel the prophet declares the mercy of the Lord in the Lord’s own admonition,
when he says: “Turn ye to the Lord your God, for He is merciful and gracious, and
patient, and of great mercy, and repenteth Him with respect to the evil that He hath inflicted.”
3300 He can show mercy; He can turn back His judgment. He can mercifully pardon
the repenting, the labouring, the beseeching sinner. He can regard as effectual whatever, in
behalf of such as these, either martyrs have besought or priests have done. Or if any one
move Him still more by his own atonement, if he appease His anger, if he appease the wrath
of an indignant God by righteous entreaty, He gives arms again whereby the vanquished
may be armed; He restores and confirms the strength whereby the refreshed faith may be
invigorated. The soldier will seek his contest anew; he will repeat the fight, he will provoke
the enemy, and indeed by his very suffering he is made braver for the battle. He who has
thus made atonement to God; he who by repentance for his deed, who by shame for his sin,
has conceived more both of virtue and of faith from the very grief of his fall, heard and aided
by the Lord, shall make the Church which he had lately saddened glad, and shall now deserve
of the Lord not only pardon, but a crown.</p>

<p>On the Lord’s Prayer.</p>
<p>Argument.—The Treatise of Cyprian on the Lord’s Prayer Comprises Three Portions,
in Which Division He Imitates Tertullian in His Book on Prayer. In the First
Portion, He Points Out that the Lord’s Prayer is the Most Excellent of All Prayers,
Profoundly Spiritual, and Most Effectual for Obtaining Our Petitions. In the
Second Part, He Undertakes an Explanation of the Lord’s Prayer; And, Still
Treading in the Footsteps of Tertullian, He Goes Through Its Seven Chief Clauses.
Finally, in the Third Part, He Considers the Conditions of Prayer, and Tells Us
What Prayer Ought to Be.3302—</p>
<p>1. The evangelical precepts, beloved brethren, are nothing else than divine teachings,—
foundations on which hope is to be built, supports to strengthen faith, nourishments
for cheering the heart, rudders for guiding our way, guards for obtaining salvation,—which,
while they instruct the docile minds of believers on the earth, lead them to heavenly kingdoms.
God, moreover, willed many things to be said and to be heard by means of the
prophets His servants; but how much greater are those which the Son speaks, which the
Word of God who was in the prophets testifies with His own voice; not now bidding to
prepare the way for His coming, but Himself coming and opening and showing to us the
way, so that we who have before been wandering in the darkness of death, without forethought
and blind, being enlightened by the light of grace, might keep the way of life, with
the Lord for our ruler and guide!</p>
<p>2. He, among the rest of His salutary admonitions and divine precepts wherewith He
counsels His people for their salvation, Himself also gave a form of praying—Himself advised
and instructed us what we should pray for. He who made us to live, taught us also to pray,
with that same benignity, to wit, wherewith He has condescended to give and confer all
things else; in order that while we speak to the Father in that prayer and supplication which
the Son has taught us, we may be the more easily heard. Already He had foretold that the

truth;”3303 and He thus fulfilled what He before promised, so that we who by His sanctification3304
have received the Spirit and truth, may also by His teaching worship truly and
spiritually. For what can be a more spiritual prayer than that which was given to us by Christ,
by whom also the Holy Spirit was given to us? What praying to the Father can be more
truthful than that which was delivered to us by the Son who is the Truth, out of His own
mouth? So that to pray otherwise than He taught is not ignorance alone, but also sin; since
He Himself has established, and said, “Ye reject the commandments of God, that ye may
keep your own traditions.”3305</p>
<p>3. Let us therefore, brethren beloved, pray as God our Teacher has taught us. It is a
loving and friendly prayer to beseech God with His own word, to come up to His ears in
the prayer of Christ. Let the Father acknowledge the words of His Son when we make our
prayer, and let Him also who dwells within in our breast Himself dwell in our voice. And
since we have Him as an Advocate with the Father for our sins, let us, when as sinners we
petition on behalf of our sins, put forward the words of our Advocate. For since He says,
that “whatsoever we shall ask of the Father in His name, He will give us,”3306 how much
more effectually do we obtain what we ask in Christ’s name, if we ask for it in His own
prayer!3307</p>
<p>4. But let our speech and petition when we pray be under discipline, observing quietness
and modesty. Let us consider that we are standing in God’s sight. We must please the divine
eyes both with the habit of body and with the measure of voice. For as it is characteristic of
a shameless man to be noisy with his cries, so, on the other hand, it is fitting to the modest
man to pray with moderated petitions. Moreover, in His teaching the Lord has bidden us
to pray in secret—in hidden and remote places, in our very bed-chambers—which is best
suited to faith, that we may know that God is everywhere present, and hears and sees all,
and in the plenitude of His majesty penetrates even into hidden and secret places, as it is
written, “I am a God at hand, and not a God afar off. If a man shall hide himself in secret
places, shall I not then see him? Do not I fill heaven and earth?”3308 And again: “The eyes
of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.”3309 And when we meet to-

gether with the brethren in one place, and celebrate divine sacrifices with God’s priest, we
ought to be mindful of modesty and discipline—not to throw abroad our prayers indiscriminately,
with unsubdued voices, nor to cast to God with tumultuous wordiness a petition
that ought to be commended to God by modesty; for God is the hearer, not of the voice,
but of the heart. Nor need He be clamorously reminded, since He sees men’s thoughts, as
the Lord proves to us when He says, “Why think ye evil in your hearts?”3310 And in another
place: “And all the churches shall know that I am He that searcheth the hearts and reins.”3311</p>
<p>5. And this Hannah in the first book of Kings, who was a type of the Church, maintains
and observes, in that she prayed to God not with clamorous petition, but silently and modestly,
within the very recesses of her heart. She spoke with hidden prayer, but with manifest
faith. She spoke not with her voice, but with her heart, because she knew that thus God
hears; and she effectually obtained what she sought, because she asked it with belief. Divine
Scripture asserts this, when it says, “She spake in her heart, and her lips moved, and her
voice was not heard; and God did hear her.”3312 We read also in the Psalms, “Speak in your
hearts, and in your beds, and be ye pierced.”3313 The Holy Spirit, moreover, suggests these
same things by Jeremiah, and teaches, saying, “But in the heart ought God to be adored by
thee.”3314</p>
<p>6. And let not the worshipper, beloved brethren, be ignorant in what manner the publican
prayed with the Pharisee in the temple. Not with eyes lifted up boldly to heaven, nor
with hands proudly raised; but beating his breast, and testifying to the sins shut up within,
he implored the help of the divine mercy. And while the Pharisee was pleased with himself,
this man who thus asked, the rather deserved to be sanctified, since he placed the hope of
salvation not in the confidence of his innocence, because there is none who is innocent; but
confessing his sinfulness he humbly prayed, and He who pardons the humble heard the
petitioner. And these things the Lord records in His Gospel, saying, “Two men went up into
the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood, and
prayed thus with himself: God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, unjust, extortioners,
adulterers, even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I
possess. But the publican stood afar off, and would not so much as lift up his eyes unto
heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner. I say unto you,
this man went down to his house justified rather than the Pharisee: for every one that exalteth
himself shall be abased; and whosoever humbleth himself shall be exalted.”3315</p>

<p>7. These things, beloved brethren, when we have learnt from the sacred reading, and
have gathered in what way we ought to approach to prayer, let us know also from the Lord’s
teaching what we should pray. “Thus,” says He, “pray ye:—
“Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will
be done, as in heaven so in earth. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors. And suffer us not to be led into temptation; but deliver us from
evil. Amen.”3316</p>
<p>8. Before all things, the Teacher of peace and the Master of unity would not have prayer
to be made singly and individually, as for one who prays to pray for himself alone. For we
say not “My Father, which art in heaven,” nor “Give me this day my daily bread;” nor does
each one ask that only his own debt should be forgiven him; nor does he request for himself
alone that he may not be led into temptation, and delivered from evil. Our prayer is public
and common; and when we pray, we pray not for one, but for the whole people, because we
the whole people are one. The God of peace and the Teacher of concord, who taught unity,
willed that one should thus pray for all, even as He Himself bore us all in one.3317 This law
of prayer the three children observed when they were shut up in the fiery furnace, speaking
together in prayer, and being of one heart in the agreement of the spirit; and this the faith
of the sacred Scripture assures us, and in telling us how such as these prayed, gives an example
which we ought to follow in our prayers, in order that we may be such as they were: “Then
these three,” it says, “as if from one mouth sang an hymn, and blessed the Lord.”3318 They
spoke as if from one mouth, although Christ had not yet taught them how to pray. And
therefore, as they prayed, their speech was availing and effectual, because a peaceful, and
sincere, and spiritual prayer deserved well of the Lord. Thus also we find that the apostles,
with the disciples, prayed after the Lord’s ascension: “They all,” says the Scripture, “continued
with one accord in prayer, with the women, and Mary who was the mother of Jesus, and
with His brethren.”3319 They continued with one accord in prayer, declaring both by the
urgency and by the agreement3320 of their praying, that God, “who maketh men to dwell
of one mind in a house,”3321 only admits into the divine and eternal home those among
whom prayer is unanimous.</p>

<p>9. But what matters of deep moment3322 are contained in the Lord’s prayer! How many
and how great, briefly collected in the words, but spiritually abundant in virtue! so that there
is absolutely nothing passed over that is not comprehended in these our prayers and petitions,
as in a compendium of heavenly doctrine. “After this manner,” says He, “pray ye: Our
Father, which art in heaven.” The new man, born again and restored to his God by His grace,
says “Father,” in the first place because he has now begun to be a son. “He came,” He says,
“to His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave
He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe in His name.”3323 The man,
therefore, who has believed in His name, and has become God’s son, ought from this point
to begin both to give thanks and to profess himself God’s son, by declaring that God is his
Father in heaven; and also to bear witness, among the very first words of his new birth, that
he has renounced an earthly and carnal father, and that he has begun to know as well as to
have as a father Him only who is in heaven, as it is written: “They who say unto their father
and their mother, I have not known thee, and who have not acknowledged their own children;
these have observed Thy precepts and have kept Thy covenant.”3324 Also the Lord in His
Gospel has bidden us to call “no man our father upon earth, because there is to us one
Father, who is in heaven.”3325 And to the disciple who had made mention of his dead
father, He replied, “Let the dead bury their dead;”3326 for he had said that his father was
dead, while the Father of believers is living.</p>
<p>10. Nor ought we, beloved brethren, only to observe and understand that we should call
Him Father who is in heaven; but we add to it, and say our Father, that is, the Father of those
who believe—of those who, being sanctified by Him, and restored by the nativity of spiritual
grace, have begun to be sons of God. A word this, moreover, which rebukes and condemns
the Jews, who not only unbelievingly despised Christ, who had been announced to them by
the prophets, and sent first to them, but also cruelly put Him to death; and these cannot
now call God their Father, since the Lord confounds and confutes them, saying, “Ye are
born of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. For he was a murderer
from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.”3327 And
by Isaiah the prophet God cries in wrath, “I have begotten and brought up children; but
they have despised me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel
hath not known me, and my people hath not understood me. Ah sinful nation, a people

laden with sins, a wicked seed, corrupt children!3328 Ye have forsaken the Lord; ye have
provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger.”3329 In repudiation of these, we Christians, when
we pray, say Our Father; because He has begun to be ours, and has ceased to be the Father
of the Jews, who have forsaken Him. Nor can a sinful people be a son; but the name of sons
is attributed to those to whom remission of sins is granted, and to them immortality is
promised anew, in the words of our Lord Himself: “Whosoever committeth sin is the servant
of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the son abideth ever.”3330</p>
<p>11. But how great is the Lord’s indulgence! how great His condescension and
plenteousness of goodness towards us, seeing that He has wished us to pray in the sight of
God in such a way as to call God Father, and to call ourselves sons of God, even as Christ
is the Son of God,—a name which none of us would dare to venture on in prayer, unless He
Himself had allowed us thus to pray! We ought then, beloved brethren, to remember and
to know, that when we call God Father, we ought to act as God’s children; so that in the
measure in which we find pleasure in considering God as a Father, He might also be able
to find pleasure in us. Let us converse as temples of God, that it may be plain that God dwells
in us. Let not our doings be degenerate from the Spirit; so that we who have begun to be
heavenly and spiritual, may consider and do nothing but spiritual and heavenly things; since
the Lord God Himself has said, “Them that honour me I will honour; and he that despiseth
me shall be despised.”3331 The blessed apostle also has laid down in his epistle: “Ye are not
your own; for ye are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear about God in your body.”3332</p>
<p>12. After this we say, “Hallowed be Thy name;” not that we wish for God that He may
be hallowed by our prayers, but that we beseech of Him that His name may be hallowed in
us. But by whom is God sanctified, since He Himself sanctifies? Well, because He says, “Be
ye holy, even as I am holy,”3333 we ask and entreat, that we who were sanctified in baptism
may continue in that which we have begun to be. And this we daily pray for; for we have
need of daily sanctification, that we who daily fall away may wash out our sins by continual
sanctification. And what the sanctification is which is conferred upon us by the condescension
of God, the apostle declares, when he says, “neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor deceivers, nor
drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such indeed
were you; but ye are washed; but ye are justified; but ye are sanctified in the name of our

Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.”3334 He says that we are sanctified in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God. We pray that this sanctification
may abide in us and because our Lord and Judge warns the man that was healed and
quickened by Him, to sin no more lest a worse thing happen unto him, we make this supplication
in our constant prayers, we ask this day and night, that the sanctification and
quickening which is received from the grace of God may be preserved by His protection.</p>
<p>13. There follows in the prayer, Thy kingdom come. We ask that the kingdom of God
may be set forth to us, even as we also ask that His name may be sanctified in us. For when
does God not reign, or when does that begin with Him which both always has been, and
never ceases to be? We pray that our kingdom, which has been promised us by God, may
come, which was acquired by the blood and passion of Christ; that we who first are His
subjects in the world, may hereafter reign with Christ when He reigns, as He Himself
promises and says, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom which has been
prepared for you from the beginning of the world.”3335 Christ Himself, dearest brethren,
however, may be the kingdom of God, whom we day by day desire to come, whose advent
we crave to be quickly manifested to us. For since He is Himself the Resurrection,3336 since
in Him we rise again, so also the kingdom of God may be understood to be Himself, since
in Him we shall reign. But we do well in seeking the kingdom of God, that is, the heavenly
kingdom, because there is also an earthly kingdom. But he who has already renounced the
world, is moreover greater than its honours and its kingdom. And therefore he who dedicates
himself to God and Christ, desires not earthly, but heavenly kingdoms. But there is need of
continual prayer and supplication, that we fall not away from the heavenly kingdom, as the
Jews, to whom this promise had first been given, fell away; even as the Lord sets forth and
proves: “Many,” says He, “shall come from the east and from the west, and shall recline with
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of the kingdom
shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”3337 He
shows that the Jews were previously children of the kingdom, so long as they continued also
to be children of God; but after the name of Father ceased to be recognised among them,
the kingdom also ceased; and therefore we Christians, who in our prayer begin to call God
our Father, pray also that God’s kingdom may come to us.</p>
<p>14. We add, also, and say, “Thy will be done, as in heaven so in earth;” not that God
should do what He wills, but that we may be able to do what God wills. For who resists God,
that He may not do what He wills? But since we are hindered by the devil from obeying

<pb n="1049"/>
with our thought and deed God’s will in all things, we pray and ask that God’s will may be
done in us; and that it may be done in us we have need of God’s good will, that is, of His
help and protection, since no one is strong in his own strength, but he is safe by the grace
and mercy of God. And further, the Lord, setting forth the infirmity of the humanity which
He bore, says, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;” and affording an example
to His disciples that they should do not their own will, but God’s, He went on to say, “Nevertheless
not as I will, but as Thou wilt.”3338 And in another place He says, “I came down
from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me.”3339 Now if the Son
was obedient to do His Father’s will, how much more should the servant be obedient to do
his Master’s will! as in his epistle John also exhorts and instructs us to do the will of God,
saying, “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the
world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh,
and the lust of the eyes, and the ambition of life, which is not of the Father, but of the lust
of the world. And the world shall pass away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will
of God abideth for ever, even as God also abideth for ever.”3340 We who desire to abide for
ever should do the will of God, who is everlasting.</p>
<p>15. Now that is the will of God which Christ both did and taught. Humility in conversation;
stedfastness in faith; modesty in words; justice in deeds; mercifulness in works; discipline
in morals; to be unable to do a wrong, and to be able to bear a wrong when done; to keep
peace with the brethren; to love God with all one’s heart; to love Him in that He is a Father;
to fear Him in that He is God; to prefer nothing whatever to Christ, because He did not
prefer anything to us; to adhere inseparably to His love; to stand by His cross bravely and
faithfully; when there is any contest on behalf of His name and honour, to exhibit in discourse
that constancy wherewith we make confession; in torture, that confidence wherewith we
do battle; in death, that patience whereby we are crowned;—this is to desire to be fellowheirs
with Christ; this is to do the commandment of God; this is to fulfil the will of the
Father.</p>
<p>16. Moreover, we ask that the will of God may be done both in heaven and in earth,
each of which things pertains to the fulfilment of our safety and salvation. For since we
possess the body from the earth and the spirit from heaven, we ourselves are earth and
heaven; and in both—that is, both in body and spirit—we pray that God’s will may be done.
For between the flesh and spirit there is a struggle; and there is a daily strife as they disagree
one with the other, so that we cannot do those very things that we would, in that the spirit
seeks heavenly and divine things, while the flesh lusts after earthly and temporal things; and
<note type="footnote">3338 Matt. xxvi. 39.</note>
<note type="footnote">3339 John vi. 38.</note>
<note type="footnote">3340 1 John ii. 15–17.</note>

<pb n="1050"/>
therefore we ask3341 that, by the help and assistance of God, agreement may be made between
these two natures, so that while the will of God is done both in the spirit and in the flesh,
the soul which is new-born by Him may be preserved. This is what the Apostle Paul openly
and manifestly declares by his words: “The flesh,” says he, “lusteth against the spirit, and
the spirit against the flesh: for these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do
the things that ye would. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adulteries,
fornications, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, murders, hatred, variance,
emulations, wraths, strife, seditions, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings,
and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in times past, that they
which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the spirit is love,
joy, peace, magnanimity, goodness, faith, gentleness, continence, chastity.”3342 And therefore
we make it our prayer in daily, yea, in continual supplications, that the will of God concerning
us should be done both in heaven and in earth; because this is the will of God, that earthly
things should give place to heavenly, and that spiritual and divine things should prevail.</p>
<p>17. And it may be thus understood, beloved brethren, that since the Lord commands
and admonishes us even to love our enemies, and to pray even for those who persecute us,
we should ask, moreover, for those who are still earth, and have not yet begun to be heavenly,
that even in respect of these God’s will should be done, which Christ accomplished in preserving
and renewing humanity. For since the disciples are not now called by Him earth,
but the salt of the earth, and the apostle designates the first man as being from the dust of
the earth, but the second from heaven, we reasonably, who ought to be like God our Father,
who maketh His sun to rise upon the good and bad, and sends rain upon the just and the
unjust, so pray and ask by the admonition of Christ as to make our prayer for the salvation
of all men; that as in heaven—that is, in us by our faith—the will of God has been done, so
that we might be of heaven; so also in earth3343—that is, in those who believe not3344—God’s
will may be done, that they who as yet are by their first birth of earth, may, being born of
water and of the Spirit, begin to be of heaven.</p>
<p>18. As the prayer goes forward, we ask and say, “Give us this day our daily bread.” And
this may be understood both spiritually and literally, because either way of understanding
it is rich in divine usefulness to our salvation. For Christ is the bread of life; and this bread
does not belong to all men, but it is ours. And according as we say, “Our Father,” because
He is the Father of those who understand and believe; so also we call it “our bread,” because

<pb n="1051"/>
Christ is the bread of those who are in union with His body.3345 And we ask that this bread
should be given to us daily, that we who are in Christ, and daily3346 receive the Eucharist
for the food of salvation, may not, by the interposition of some heinous sin, by being prevented,
as withheld and not communicating, from partaking of the heavenly bread, be separated
from Christ’s body, as He Himself predicts, and warns, “I am the bread of life which
came down from heaven. If any man eat of my bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread
which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.”3347 When, therefore, He says, that
whoever shall eat of His bread shall live for ever; as it is manifest that those who partake of
His body and receive the Eucharist by the right of communion are living, so, on the other
hand, we must fear and pray lest any one who, being withheld from communion, is separate
from Christ’s body should remain at a distance from salvation; as He Himself threatens,
and says, “Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye shall have no
life in you.”3348 And therefore we ask that our bread—that is, Christ—may be given to us
daily, that we who abide and live in Christ may not depart from His sanctification and
body.3349</p>
<p>19. But it may also be thus understood, that we who have renounced the world, and
have cast away its riches and pomps in the faith of spiritual grace, should only ask for
ourselves food and support, since the Lord instructs us, and says, “Whosoever forsaketh
not all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.”3350 But he who has begun to be Christ’s disciple,
renouncing all things according to the word of his Master, ought to ask for his daily food,
and not to extend the desires of his petition to a long period, as the Lord again prescribes,
and says, “Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow itself shall take thought for itself.
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.”3351 With reason, then, does Christ’s disciple ask
food for himself for the day, since he is prohibited from thinking of the morrow; because it
becomes a contradiction and a repugnant thing for us to seek to live long in this world, since
we ask that the kingdom of God should come quickly. Thus also the blessed apostle admonishes
us, giving substance and strength to the stedfastness of our hope and faith: “We brought

nothing,” says he, “into this world, nor indeed can we carry anything out. Having therefore
food and raiment, let us be herewith content. But they that will be rich fall into temptation
and a snare, and into many and hurtful lusts, which drown men in perdition and destruction.
For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have made
shipwreck from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.”3352</p>
<p>20. He teaches us that riches are not only to be contemned, but that they are also full of
peril; that in them is the root of seducing evils, that deceive the blindness of the human
mind by a hidden deception. Whence also God rebukes the rich fool, who thinks of his
earthly wealth, and boasts himself in the abundance of his overflowing harvests, saying,
“Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be
which thou hast provided?”3353 The fool who was to die that very night was rejoicing in his
stores, and he to whom life already was failing, was thinking of the abundance of his food.
But, on the other hand, the Lord tells us that he becomes perfect and complete who sells all
his goods, and distributes them for the use of the poor, and so lays up for himself treasure
in heaven. He says that that man is able to follow Him, and to imitate the glory of the Lord’s
passion, who, free from hindrance, and with his loins girded, is involved in no entanglements
of worldly estate, but, at large and free himself, accompanies his possessions, which before
have been sent to God. For which result, that every one of us may be able to prepare himself,
let him thus learn to pray, and know, from the character of the prayer, what he ought to be.</p>
<p>21. For daily bread cannot be wanting to the righteous man, since it is written, “The
Lord will not slay the soul of the righteous by hunger;”3354 and again “I have been young
and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their
bread.”3355 And the Lord moreover promises and says, “Take no thought, saying, ‘What
shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewithal shall we be clothed?’ For after all these
things do the nations seek. And your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added
unto you.”3356 To those who seek God’s kingdom and righteousness, He promises that all
things shall be added.3357 For since all things are God’s, nothing will be wanting to him who
possesses God, if God Himself be not wanting to him. Thus a meal was divinely provided
for Daniel: when he was shut up by the king’s command in the den of lions, and in the midst
of wild beasts who were hungry, and yet spared him, the man of God was fed. Thus Elijah

in his flight was nourished both by ravens ministering to him in his solitude, and by birds
bringing him food in his persecution. And—oh detestable cruelty of the malice of man!—the
wild beasts spare, the birds feed, while men lay snares, and rage!</p>
<p>22. After this we also entreat for our sins, saying, “And forgive us our debts, as we also
forgive our debtors.” After the supply of food, pardon of sin is also asked for, that he who
is fed by God may live in God, and that not only the present and temporal life may be
provided for, but the eternal also, to which we may come if our sins are forgiven; and these
the Lord calls debts, as He says in His Gospel, “I forgave thee all that debt, because thou
desiredst me.”3358 And how necessarily, how providently and salutarily, are we admonished
that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for our sins, and while pardon is asked
for from God, the soul recalls its own consciousness of sin! Lest any one should flatter
himself that he is innocent,3359 and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is
instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden to entreat daily for his sins.
Thus, moreover, John also in his epistle warns us, and says, “If we say that we have no sin,
we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us; but if we confess our sins, the Lord is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins.”3360 In his epistle he has combined both, that we should entreat
for our sins, and that we should obtain pardon when we ask. Therefore he said that the Lord
was faithful to forgive sins, keeping the faith of His promise; because He who taught us to
pray for our debts and sins, has promised that His fatherly mercy and pardon shall follow.</p>
<p>23. He has clearly joined herewith and added the law, and has bound us by a certain
condition and engagement, that we should ask that our debts be forgiven us in such a
manner as we ourselves forgive our debtors, knowing that that which we seek for our sins
cannot be obtained unless we ourselves have acted in a similar way in respect of our debtors.
Therefore also He says in another place, “With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured
to you again.”3361 And the servant who, after having had all his debt forgiven him by his
master, would not forgive his fellow-servant, is cast back into prison; because he would not
forgive his fellow-servant, he lost the indulgence that had been shown to himself by his lord.
And these things Christ still more urgently sets forth in His precepts with yet greater power
of His rebuke. “When ye stand praying,” says He, “forgive if ye have aught against any, that
your Father which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive,
neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses.”3362 There remains

no ground of excuse in the day of judgment, when you will be judged according to your
own sentence; and whatever you have done, that you also will suffer. For God commands
us to be peacemakers, and in agreement, and of one mind in His house;3363 and such as He
makes us by a second birth, such He wishes us when new-born to continue, that we who
have begun to be sons of God may abide in God’s peace, and that, having one spirit, we
should also have one heart and one mind. Thus God does not receive the sacrifice of a
person who is in disagreement, but commands him to go back from the altar and first be
reconciled to his brother, that so God also may be appeased by the prayers of a peace-maker.
Our peace and brotherly agreement3364 is the greater sacrifice to God,—and a people united
in one in the unity of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>24. For even in the sacrifices which Abel and Cain first offered, God looked not at their
gifts, but at their hearts, so that he was acceptable in his gift who was acceptable in his heart.
Abel, peaceable and righteous in sacrificing in innocence to God, taught others also, when
they bring their gift to the altar, thus to come with the fear of God, with a simple heart, with
the law of righteousness, with the peace of concord. With reason did he, who was such in
respect of God’s sacrifice, become subsequently himself a sacrifice to God; so that he who
first set forth martyrdom, and initiated the Lord’s passion by the glory of his blood, had
both the Lord’s righteousness and His peace. Finally, such are crowned by the Lord, such
will be avenged3365 with the Lord in the day of judgment; but the quarrelsome and disunited,
and he who has not peace with his brethren, in accordance with what the blessed apostle
and the Holy Scripture testifies, even if he have been slain for the name of Christ, shall not
be able to escape the crime of fraternal dissension, because, as it is written, “He who hateth
his brother is a murderer,”3366 and no murderer attains to the kingdom of heaven, nor does
he live with God. He cannot be with Christ, who had rather be an imitator of Judas than of
Christ. How great is the sin which cannot even be washed away by a baptism of blood—how
heinous the crime which cannot be expiated by martyrdom!</p>
<p>25. Moreover, the Lord of necessity admonishes us to say in prayer, “And suffer us not
to be led into temptation.” In which words it is shown that the adversary can do nothing
against us except God shall have previously permitted it; so that all our fear, and devotion,
and obedience may be turned towards God, since in our temptations nothing is permitted
to evil unless power is given from Him. This is proved by divine Scripture, which says,
“Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and besieged it; and the Lord delivered
<note type="footnote">3363 [Ps. lxviii. 6. Vulgate and Angl. Psalter.]</note>

<note type="footnote">3366 1 John iii. 15.</note>

<pb n="1055"/>
it into his hand.”3367 But power is given to evil against us according to our sins, as it is
written, “Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to those who make a prey of Him? Did not
the Lord, against whom they sinned, and would not walk in His ways, nor hear His law?
and He has brought upon them the anger of His wrath.”3368 And again, when Solomon
sinned, and departed from the Lord’s commandments and ways, it is recorded, “And the
Lord stirred up Satan against Solomon himself.”3369</p>
<p>26. Now power is given against us in two modes: either for punishment when we sin,
or for glory when we are proved, as we see was done with respect to Job; as God Himself
sets forth, saying, “Behold, all that he hath I give unto thy hands; but be careful not to touch
himself.”3370 And the Lord in His Gospel says, in the time of His passion, “Thou couldest
have no power against me unless it were given thee from above.”3371 But when we ask that
we may not come into temptation, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness in that
we thus ask, lest any should insolently vaunt himself, lest any should proudly and arrogantly
assume anything to himself, lest any should take to himself the glory either of confession
or of suffering as his own, when the Lord Himself, teaching humility, said, “Watch and pray,
that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak;”3372 so
that while a humble and submissive confession comes first, and all is attributed to God,
whatever is sought for suppliantly with fear and honour of God, may be granted by His own
loving-kindness.</p>
<p>27. After all these things, in the conclusion of the prayer comes a brief clause, which
shortly and comprehensively sums up all our petitions and our prayers. For we conclude
by saying, “But deliver us from evil,” comprehending all adverse things which the enemy
attempts against us in this world, from which there may be a faithful and sure protection if
God deliver us, if He afford His help to us who pray for and implore it. And when we say,
Deliver us from evil, there remains nothing further which ought to be asked. When we have
once asked for God’s protection against evil, and have obtained it, then against everything
which the devil and the world work against us we stand secure and safe. For what fear is
there in this life, to the man whose guardian in this life is God?</p>
<p>28. What wonder is it, beloved brethren, if such is the prayer which God taught, seeing
that He condensed in His teaching all our prayer in one saving sentence? This had already
been before foretold by Isaiah the prophet, when, being filled with the Holy Spirit, he spoke

<pb n="1056"/>
of the majesty and loving-kindness of God, “consummating and shortening His word,”3373
He says, “in righteousness, because a shortened word3374 will the Lord make in the whole
earth.”3375 For when the Word of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, came unto all, and gathering
alike the learned and unlearned, published to every sex and every age the precepts of salvation,
He made a large compendium of His precepts, that the memory of the scholars might not
be burdened in the celestial learning, but might quickly learn what was necessary to a simple
faith. Thus, when He taught what is life eternal, He embraced the sacrament of life in a large
and divine brevity, saying, “And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only and
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.”3376 Also, when He would gather from
the law and the prophets the first and greatest commandments, He said, “Hear, O Israel;
the Lord thy God is one God: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment. And the second
is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”3377 “On these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets.”3378 And again: “Whatsoever good things ye would that
men should do unto you, do ye even so to them. For this is the law and the prophets.”3379</p>
<p>29. Nor was it only in words, but in deeds also, that the Lord taught us to pray, Himself
praying frequently and beseeching, and thus showing us, by the testimony of His example,
what it behoved us to do, as it is written, “But Himself departed into a solitary place, and
there prayed.”3380 And again: “He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night
in prayer to God.”3381 But if He prayed who was without sin, how much more ought sinners
to pray; and if He prayed continually, watching through the whole night in uninterrupted
petitions, how much more ought we to watch3382 nightly in constantly repeated prayer!</p>
<p>30. But the Lord prayed and besought not for Himself—for why should He who was
guiltless pray on His own behalf?—but for our sins, as He Himself declared, when He said
to Peter, “Behold, Satan hath desired that he might sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for
thee, that thy faith fail not.”3383 And subsequently He beseeches the Father for all, saying,

“Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their
word; that they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in me, and I in Thee, that they also may
be one in us.”3384 The Lord’s loving-kindness, no less than His mercy, is great in respect of
our salvation, in that, not content to redeem us with His blood, He in addition also prayed
for us. Behold now what was the desire of His petition, that like as the Father and Son are
one, so also we should abide in absolute unity; so that from this it may be understood how
greatly he sins who divides unity and peace, since for this same thing even the Lord besought,
desirous doubtless that His people should thus be saved and live in peace, since He knew
that discord cannot come into the kingdom of God.3385</p>
<p>31. Moreover, when we stand praying, beloved brethren, we ought to be watchful and
earnest with our whole heart, intent on our prayers. Let all carnal and worldly thoughts pass
away, nor let the soul at that time think on anything but the object only of its prayer. For
this reason also the priest, by way of preface before his prayer, prepares the minds of the
brethren by saying, “Lift up your hearts,” that so upon the people’s response, “We lift them
up unto the Lord,” he may be reminded that he himself ought to think of nothing but the
Lord.3386 Let the breast be closed against the adversary, and be open to God alone; nor let
it suffer God’s enemy to approach to it at the time of prayer. For frequently he steals upon
us, and penetrates within, and by crafty deceit calls away our prayers from God, that we
may have one thing in our heart and another in our voice, when not the sound of the voice,
but the soul and mind, ought to be praying to the Lord with a simple intention. But what
carelessness it is, to be distracted and carried away by foolish and profane thoughts when
you are praying to the Lord, as if there were anything which you should rather be thinking
of than that you are speaking with God! How can you ask to be heard of God, when you
yourself do not hear yourself? Do you wish that God should remember you when you ask,
if you yourself do not remember yourself? This is absolutely to take no precaution against
the enemy; this is, when you pray to God, to offend the majesty of God by the carelessness
of your prayer; this is to be watchful with your eyes, and to be asleep with your heart, while
the Christian, even though he is asleep with his eyes, ought to be awake with his heart, as it
is written in the person of the Church speaking in the Song of Songs, “I sleep, yet my heart
waketh.”3387 Wherefore the apostle anxiously and carefully warns us, saying, “Continue in
prayer, and watch in the same;”3388 teaching, that is, and showing that those are able to
obtain from God what they ask, whom God sees to be watchful in their prayer.</p>

<p>32. Moreover, those who pray should not come to God with fruitless or naked prayers.
Petition is ineffectual when it is a barren entreaty that beseeches God.3389 For as every tree
that bringeth not forth fruit is cut down and cast into the fire; assuredly also, words that do
not bear fruit cannot deserve anything of God, because they are fruitful in no result. And
thus Holy Scripture instructs us, saying, “Prayer is good with fasting and almsgiving.”3390
For He who will give us in the day of judgment a reward for our labours and alms, is even
in this life a merciful hearer of one who comes to Him in prayer associated with good works.
Thus, for instance, Cornelius the centurion, when he prayed, had a claim to be heard. For
he was in the habit of doing many alms-deeds towards the people, and of ever praying to
God. To this man, when he prayed about the ninth hour, appeared an angel bearing testimony
to his labours, and saying, “Cornelius, thy prayers and thine alms are gone up in remembrance
before God.”3391</p>
<p>33. Those prayers quickly ascend to God which the merits of our labours urge upon
God. Thus also Raphael the angel was a witness to the constant prayer and the constant
good works of Tobias, saying, “It is honourable to reveal and confess the works of God. For
when thou didst pray, and Sarah, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the
holiness of God. And when thou didst bury the dead in simplicity, and because thou didst
not delay to rise up and to leave thy dinner, but didst go out and cover the dead, I was sent
to prove thee; and again God has sent me to heal thee, and Sarah thy daughter-in-law. For
I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels which stand and go in and out before the glory
of God.”3392 By Isaiah also the Lord reminds us, and teaches similar things, saying, “Loosen
every knot of iniquity, release the oppressions of contracts which have no power, let the
troubled go into peace, and break every unjust engagement. Break thy bread to the hungry,
and bring the poor that are without shelter into thy house. When thou seest the naked,
clothe him; and despise not those of the same family and race as thyself. Then shall thy light
break forth in season, and thy raiment shall spring forth speedily; and righteousness shall
go before thee, and the glory of God shall surround thee. Then shalt thou call, and God shall
hear thee; and while thou shalt yet speak, He shall say, Here I am.”3393 He promises that
He will be at hand, and says that He will hear and protect those who, loosening the knots
of unrighteousness from their heart, and giving alms among the members of God’s household
according to His commands, even in hearing what God commands to be done, do themselves
also deserve to be heard by God. The blessed Apostle Paul, when aided in the necessity of

affliction by his brethren, said that good works which are performed are sacrifices to God.
“I am full,” saith he, “having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you,
an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.”3394 For when one
has pity on the poor, he lends to God; and he who gives to the least gives to God—sacrifices
spiritually to God an odour of a sweet smell.</p>
<p>34. And in discharging the duties of prayer, we find that the three children with Daniel,
being strong in faith and victorious in captivity, observed the third, sixth, and ninth hour,
as it were, for a sacrament of the Trinity, which in the last times had to be manifested. For
both the first hour in its progress to the third shows forth the consummated number of the
Trinity, and also the fourth proceeding to the sixth declares another Trinity; and when from
the seventh the ninth is completed, the perfect Trinity is numbered every three hours, which
spaces of hours the worshippers of God in time past having spiritually decided on, made
use of for determined and lawful times for prayer. And subsequently the thing was manifested,
that these things were of old Sacraments, in that anciently righteous men prayed in this
manner. For upon the disciples at the third hour the Holy Spirit descended, who fulfilled
the grace of the Lord’s promise. Moreover, at the sixth hour, Peter, going up unto the housetop,
was instructed as well by the sign as by the word of God admonishing him to receive
all to the grace of salvation, whereas he was previously doubtful of the receiving of the
Gentiles to baptism. And from the sixth hour to the ninth, the Lord, being crucified, washed
away our sins by His blood; and that He might redeem and quicken us, He then accomplished
His victory by His passion.</p>
<p>35. But for us, beloved brethren, besides the hours of prayer observed of old,3395 both
the times and the sacraments have now increased in number. For we must also pray in the
morning, that the Lord’s resurrection may be celebrated by morning prayer. And this
formerly the Holy Spirit pointed out in the Psalms, saying, “My King, and my God, because
unto Thee will I cry; O Lord, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; in the morning will
I stand before Thee, and will look up to Thee.”3396 And again, the Lord speaks by the mouth
of the prophet: “Early in the morning shall they watch for me, saying, Let us go, and return
unto the Lord our God.”3397 Also at the sunsetting and at the decline of day, of necessity
we must pray again. For since Christ is the true sun and the true day, as the worldly sun and
worldly day depart, when we pray and ask that light may return to us again, we pray for the
advent of Christ, which shall give us the grace of everlasting light. Moreover, the Holy
Spirit in the Psalms manifests that Christ is called the day. “The stone,” says He, “which the

builders rejected, is become the head of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing; and it is marvellous
in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; let us walk and rejoice in
it.”3398 Also the prophet Malachi testifies that He is called the Sun, when he says, “But to
you that fear the name of the Lord shall the Sun of righteousness arise, and there is healing
in His wings.”3399 But if in the Holy Scriptures the true sun and the true day is Christ, there
is no hour excepted for Christians wherein God ought not frequently and always to be
worshipped; so that we who are in Christ—that is, in the true Sun and the true Day—should
be instant throughout the entire day in petitions, and should pray; and when, by the law of
the world, the revolving night, recurring in its alternate changes, succeeds, there can be no
harm arising from the darkness of night to those who pray, because the children of light
have the day even in the night. For when is he without light who has light in his heart? or
when has not he the sun and the day, whose Sun and Day is Christ?</p>
<p>36. Let not us, then, who are in Christ—that is, always in the light—cease from praying
even during night. Thus the widow Anna, without intermission praying and watching,
persevered in deserving well of God, as it is written in the Gospel: “She departed not,” it
says, “from the temple, serving with fastings and prayers night and day.”3400 Let the Gentiles
look to this, who are not yet enlightened, or the Jews who have remained in darkness by
having forsaken the light. Let us, beloved brethren, who are always in the light of the Lord,
who remember and hold fast what by grace received we have begun to be, reckon night for
day; let us believe that we always walk in the light, and let us not be hindered by the darkness
which we have escaped. Let there be no failure of prayers in the hours of night—no idle and
reckless waste of the occasions of prayer. New-created and newborn of the Spirit by the
mercy of God, let us imitate what we shall one day be. Since in the kingdom we shall possess
day alone, without intervention of night, let us so watch in the night as if in the daylight.
Since we are to pray and give thanks to God for ever, let us not cease in this life also to pray
and give thanks.3401</p>

<p>An Address to Demetrianus.</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian, in Reply to Demetrianus the Proconsul of Africa, Who Contended
that the Wars, and Famine, and Pestilence with Which the World Was
Then Plagued Must Be Imputed to the Christians Because They Did Not Worship
the Gods; Fairly Urges (Having Argued that All Things are Gradually Deteriorating

Who Were the Cause of Such Mischiefs, Because They Did Not Worship God,
And, Moreover, Were Distressing the Christians with Unjust Persecutions.3403</p>
<p>1. I had frequently, Demetrianus, treated with contempt your railing and noisy clamour
with sacrilegious mouth and impious words against the one and true God, thinking it more
modest and better, silently to scorn the ignorance of a mistaken man, than by speaking to
provoke the fury of a senseless one. Neither did I do this without the authority of the divine
teaching,3404 since it is written, “Speak not in the ears of a fool, lest when he hear thee he
should despise the wisdom of thy words;”3405 and again, “Answer not a fool according to
his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.”3406 And we are, moreover, bidden to keep what
is holy within our own knowledge, and not expose it to be trodden down by swine and dogs,
since the Lord speaks, saying, “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye
your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend

Christians more severely than any other criminals, not for the purpose of making them confess, but of making
them deny their faith, he shows the impotence of the gods,—as well because they themselves cannot defend
themselves, and so Demetrianus, who pretended to avenge them, should rather be worshipped by them, than
himself worship them;—as because, when expelled by Christians from possessed bodies, they themselves confess
what they are. Nor indeed must the fall of kings, the destruction of property, and such like evils which accompanied
the persecutions of Christians as a punishment from Heaven, be judged not to be punishments, because
they were shared by the Christians themselves; inasmuch as all these things are a joy to them rather than a
punishment. Accordingly, while there is time, he urges him to return to a better mind, or at least to dread the
judgment and an ever burning fiery Gehenna. In this tract Cyprian partly imitates Tertullian’s Apology and his

you.”3407 For when you used often to come to me with the desire of contradicting rather
than with the wish to learn, and preferred impudently to insist on your own views, which
you shouted with noisy words, to patiently listening to mine, it seemed to me foolish to
contend with you; since it would be an easier and slighter thing to restrain the angry waves
of a turbulent sea with shouts, than to check your madness by arguments. Assuredly it
would be both a vain and ineffectual labour to offer light to a blind man, discourse to a deaf
one, or wisdom to a brute; since neither can a brute apprehend, nor can a blind man admit
the light, nor can a deaf man hear.</p>
<p>2. In consideration of this, I have frequently held my tongue, and overcome an impatient
man with patience; since I could neither teach an unteachable man, nor check an impious
one with religion, nor restrain a frantic man with gentleness. But yet, when you say that
very many are complaining that to us it is ascribed that wars arise more frequently, that
plague, that famines rage, and that long droughts are suspending the showers and rains, it
is not fitting that I should be silent any longer, lest my silence should begin to be attributed
to mistrust rather than to modesty; and while I am treating the false charges with contempt,
I may seem to be acknowledging the crime. I reply, therefore, as well to you, Demetrianus,
as to others whom perhaps you have stirred up, and many of whom, by sowing hatred against
us with malicious words, you have made your own partisans, from the budding forth of
your own root and origin, who, however, I believe, will admit the reasonableness of my
discourse; for he who is moved to evil by the deception of a lie, will much more easily be
moved to good by the cogency of truth.</p>
<p>3. You have said that all these things are caused by us, and that to us ought to be attributed
the misfortunes wherewith the world is now shaken and distressed, because your gods
are not worshipped by us. And in this behalf, since you are ignorant of divine knowledge,
and a stranger to the truth, you must in the first place know this, that the world has now
grown old, and does not abide in that strength in which it formerly stood; nor has it that
vigour and force which it formerly possessed. This, even were we silent, and if we alleged
no proofs from the sacred Scriptures and from the divine declarations, the world itself is
now announcing, and, bearing witness to its decline by the testimony of its failing estate.3408
In the winter there is not such an abundance of showers for nourishing the seeds; in the
summer the sun has not so much heat for cherishing the harvest; nor in the spring season
are the corn-fields so joyous; nor are the autumnal seasons so fruitful in their leafy products.
The layers of marble are dug out in less quantity from the disembowelled and wearied
mountains; the diminished quantities of gold and silver suggest the early exhaustion of the
metals, and the impoverished veins are straitened and decreased day by day; the husbandman

is failing in the fields, the sailor at sea, the soldier in the camp, innocence in the market,
justice in the tribunal, concord in friendships, skilfulness in the arts, discipline in morals.
Think you that the substantial character of a thing that is growing old remains so robust as
that wherewith it might previously flourish in its youth while still new and vigorous?
Whatever is tending downwards to decay, with its end nearly approaching, must of necessity
be weakened. Thus, the sun at his setting darts his rays with a less bright and fiery splendour;
thus, in her declining course, the moon wanes with exhausted horns; and the tree, which
before had been green and fertile, as its branches dry up, becomes by and by misshapen in
a barren old age; and the fountain which once gushed forth liberally from its overflowing
veins, as old age causes it to fail, scarcely trickles with a sparing moisture. This is the sentence
passed on the world, this is God’s law; that everything that has had a beginning should
perish, and things that have grown should become old, and that strong things should become
weak, and great things become small, and that, when they have become weakened and diminished,
they should come to an end.</p>
<p>4. You impute it to the Christians that everything is decaying as the world grows old.
What if old men should charge it on the Christians that they grow less strong in their old
age; that they no longer, as formerly, have the same facilities, in the hearing of their ears, in
the swiftness of their feet, in the keenness of their eyes, in the vigour of their strength, in
the freshness of their organic powers, in the fulness of their limbs, and that although once
the life of men endured beyond the age of eight and nine hundred years, it can now scarcely
attain to its hundredth year? We see grey hairs in boys—the hair fails before it begins to
grow; and life does not cease in old age, but it begins with old age. Thus, even at its very
commencement, birth hastens to its close;3409 thus, whatever is now born degenerates with
the old age of the world itself; so that no one ought to wonder that everything begins to fail
in the world, when the whole world itself is already in process of failing, and in its end.</p>
<p>5. Moreover, that wars continue frequently to prevail, that death and famine accumulate
anxiety, that health is shattered by raging diseases, that the human race is wasted by the
desolation of pestilence, know that this was foretold; that evils should be multiplied in the
last times, and that misfortunes should be varied; and that as the day of judgment is now
drawing nigh, the censure of an indignant God should be more and more aroused for the
scourging of the human race. For these things happen not, as your false complaining and
ignorant inexperience of the truth asserts and repeats, because your gods are not worshipped
by us, but because God is not worshipped by you. For since He is Lord and Ruler of the
world, and all things are carried on by His will and direction, nor can anything be done save
what He Himself has done or allowed to be done, certainly when those things occur which
show the anger of an offended God, they happen not on account of us by whom God is
<note type="footnote">3409 [Wisd. v. 13.]</note>

<pb n="1064"/>
worshipped, but they are called down by your sins and deservings, by whom God is neither
in any way sought nor feared, because your vain superstitions are not forsaken, nor the true
religion known in such wise that He who is the one God over all might alone be worshipped
and petitioned.</p>
<p>6. In fine, listen to Himself speaking; Himself with a divine voice at once instructing
and warning us: “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,” says He, “and Him only shalt thou
serve.”3410 And again, “Thou shalt have none other gods but me.”3411 And again, “Go not
after other gods, to serve them; and worship them not, and provoke not me to anger with
the works of your hands to destroy you.”3412 Moreover, the prophet, filled with the Holy
Spirit, attests and denounces the anger of God, saying, “Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Because
of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man to his own house, therefore the
heavens shall be stayed from dew, and the earth shall withhold her fruits: and I will bring a
sword upon the earth, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon
men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labours of their hands.”3413 Moreover, another
prophet repeats, and says, “And I will cause it to rain upon one city, and upon another city
I will cause it not to rain. One piece shall be rained upon, and the piece whereon I send no
rain shall be withered. And two and three cities shall be gathered into one city to drink water,
and shall not be satisfied; and ye are not converted unto me, saith the Lord.”3414</p>
<p>7. Behold, the Lord is angry and wrathful, and threatens, because you turn not unto
Him. And you wonder or complain in this your obstinacy and contempt, if the rain comes
down with unusual scarcity; and the earth falls into neglect with dusty corruption; if the
barren glebe hardly brings forth a few jejune and pallid blades of grass; if the destroying hail
weakens the vines; if the overwhelming whirlwind roots out the olive; if drought stanches
the fountain; a pestilent breeze corrupts the air; the weakness of disease wastes away man;
although all these things come as the consequence of the sins that provoke them, and God
is more deeply indignant when such and so great evils avail nothing! For that these things
occur either for the discipline of the obstinate or for the punishment of the evil, the same
God declares in the Holy Scriptures, saying, “In vain have I smitten your children; they have
not received correction.”3415 And the prophet devoted and dedicated to God answers to
these words in the same strain, and says, “Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved;
Thou hast scourged them, but they have refused to receive correction.”3416 Lo, stripes are

inflicted from God, and there is no fear of God. Lo, blows and scourgings from above are
not wanting, and there is no trembling, no fear. What if even no such rebuke as that interfered
in human affairs? How much greater still would be the audacity in men, if it were secure in
the impunity of their crimes!</p>
<p>8. You complain that the fountains are now less plentiful to you, and the breezes less
salubrious, and the frequent showers and the fertile earth afford you less ready assistance;
that the elements no longer subserve your uses and your pleasures as of old. But do you
serve God, by whom all things are ordained to your service; do you wait upon Him by whose
good pleasure all things wait upon you?3417 From your slave you yourself require service;
and though a man, you compel your fellow-man to submit, and to be obedient to you; and
although you share the same lot in respect of being born, the same condition in respect of
dying; although you have like bodily substance and a common order of souls, and although
you come into this world of ours and depart from it after a time with equal rights,3418 and
by the same law; yet, unless you are served by him according to your pleasure, unless you
are obeyed by him in conformity to your will, you, as an imperious and excessive exactor
of his service, flog and scourge him: you afflict and torture him with hunger, with thirst and
nakedness, and even frequently with the sword and with imprisonment. And, wretch that
you are, do you not acknowledge the Lord your God while you yourself are thus exercising
lordship?3419</p>
<p>9. And therefore with reason in these plagues that occur, there are not wanting God’s
stripes and scourges; and since they are of no avail in this matter, and do not convert individuals
to God by such terror of destructions, there remains after all the eternal dungeon,
and the continual fire, and the everlasting punishment; nor shall the groaning of the suppliants
be heard there, because here the terror of the angry God was not heard, crying by His
prophet, and saying, “Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the judgment of
the Lord is against the inhabitants of the earth; because there is neither mercy, nor truth,
nor knowledge of God upon the earth. But cursing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and
committing adultery, is broken out over the land, they mingle blood with blood. Therefore
shall the land mourn, with every one that dwelleth therein, with the beasts of the field, with
things that creep on the earth, and with the fowls of heaven; and the fishes of the sea shall

languish, so that no man shall judge, no man shall rebuke.”3420 God says He is wrathful and
angry, because there is no acknowledgment of God in the earth, and God is neither known
nor feared. The sins of lying, of lust, of fraud, of cruelty, of impiety, of anger, God rebukes
and finds fault with, and no one is converted to innocency. Lo, those things are happening
which were before foretold by the words of God; nor is any one admonished by the belief
of things present to take thought for what is to come. Amongst those very misfortunes
wherein the soul, closely bound and shut up, can scarcely breathe, there is still found opportunity
for men to be evil, and in such great dangers to judge not so much of themselves as
of others. You are indignant that God is angry, as if by an evil life you were deserving any
good, as if all things of that kind which happen were not infinitely less and of smaller account
than your sins.</p>
<p>10. You who judge others, be for once also a judge of yourself; look into the hidingplaces
of your own conscience; nay, since now there is not even any shame in your sin,3421
and you are wicked, as if it were rather the very wickedness itself that pleased you, do you,
who are seen clearly and nakedly by all other men, yourself also look upon yourself. For
either you are swollen with pride, or greedy with avarice, or cruel with anger, or prodigal
with gambling, or flushed with intemperance, or envious with jealousy, or unchaste with
lust, or violent with cruelty; and do you wonder that God’s anger increases in punishing the
human race, when the sin that is punished is daily increasing? You complain that the enemy
rises up, as if, though an enemy were wanting, there could be peace for you even among the
very togas of peace. You complain that the enemy rises up, as if, even although external
arms and dangers from barbarians were repressed, the weapons of domestic assault from
the calumnies and wrongs of powerful citizens, would not be more ferocious and more
harshly wielded within. You complain of barrenness and famine, as if drought made a
greater famine than rapacity, as if the fierceness of want did not increase more terribly from
grasping at the increase of the year’s produce, and the accumulation of their price. You
complain that the heaven is shut up from showers, although in the same way the barns are
shut up on earth. You complain that now less is produced, as if what had already been produced
were given to the indigent. You reproach plague and disease, while by plague itself
and disease the crimes of individuals are either detected or increased, while mercy is not
manifested to the weak, and avarice and rapine are waiting open-mouthed for the dead. The
same men are timid in the duties of affection, but rash in quest of implores gains; shunning
the deaths of the dying, and craving the spoils of the dead, so that it may appear as if the
wretched are probably forsaken in their sickness for this cause, that they may not, by being

<note type="footnote">3421 Some texts read, “fear or shame in sinning.”</note>

<pb n="1067"/>
cured, escape: for he who enters so eagerly upon the estate of the dying, probably desired
the sick man to perish.</p>
<p>11. So great a terror of destruction cannot give the teaching of innocency; and in the
midst of a people dying with constant havoc, nobody considers that he himself is mortal.
Everywhere there is scattering, there is seizure, there is taking possession; no dissimulation
about spoiling, and no delay.3422 As if it were all lawful, as if it were all becoming, as if he
who does not rob were suffering loss and wasting his own property, thus every one hastens
to the rapine. Among thieves there is at any rate some modesty in their crimes. They love
pathless ravines and deserted solitudes; and they do wrong in such a way, that still the crime
of the wrong-doers is veiled by darkness and night. Avarice, however, rages openly, and,
safe by its very boldness, exposes the weapons of its headlong craving in the light of the
market-place. Thence cheats, thence poisoners, thence assassins in the midst of the city, are
as eager for wickedness as they are wicked with impunity. The crime is committed by the
guilty, and the guiltless who can avenge it is not found. There is no fear from accuser or
judge: the wicked obtain impunity, while modest men are silent; accomplices are afraid, and
those who are to judge are for sale. And therefore by the mouth of the prophet the truth of
the matter is put forth with the divine spirit and instinct: it is shown in a certain and obvious
way that God can prevent adverse things, but that the evil deserts of sinners prevent His
bringing aid. “Is the Lord’s hand,” says he, “not strong to save you; or has He made heavy
His ear, that He cannot hear you? But your sins separate between you and God; and because
of your sins He hath hid His face from you, that He may not have mercy.”3423 Therefore
let your sins and offences be reckoned up; let the wounds of your conscience be considered;
and let each one cease complaining about God, or about us, if he should perceive that himself
deserves what he suffers.</p>
<p>12. Look what that very matter is of which is chiefly our discourse—that you molest us,
although innocent; that, in contempt of God, you attack and oppress God’s servants. It is
little, in your account, that your life is stained with a variety of gross vices, with the iniquity
of deadly crimes, with the summary of all bloody rapines; that true religion is overturned
by false superstitions; that God is neither sought at all, nor feared at all; but over and above
this, you weary3424 God’s servants, and those who are dedicated to His majesty and His
name, with unjust persecutions. It is not enough that you yourself do not worship God, but,
over and above, you persecute those who do worship, with a sacrilegious hostility. You
neither worship God, nor do you at all permit Him to be worshipped; and while others who
venerate not only those foolish idols and images made by man’s hands, but even portents

and monsters besides, are pleasing to you, it is only the worshipper of God who is displeasing
to you. The ashes of victims and the piles of cattle everywhere smoke in your temples, and
God’s altars are either nowhere or are hidden. Crocodiles, and apes, and stones, and serpents
are worshipped by you; and God alone in the earth is not worshipped, or if worshipped, not
with impunity. You deprive the innocent, the just, the dear to God, of their home; you spoil
them of their estate, you load them with chains, you shut them up in prison, you punish
them with the sword, with the wild beasts, with the flames. Nor, indeed, are you content
with a brief endurance of our sufferings, and with a simple and swift exhaustion of pains.
You set on foot tedious tortures, by tearing our bodies; you multiply numerous punishments,
by lacerating our vitals; nor can your brutality and fierceness be content with ordinary tortures;
your ingenious cruelty devises new sufferings.</p>
<p>13. What is this insatiable madness for blood-shedding, what this interminable lust of
cruelty? Rather make your election of one of two alternatives. To be a Christian is either a
crime, or it is not. If it be a crime, why do you not put the man that confesses it to death? If
it be not a crime, why do you persecute an innocent man? For I ought to be put to the torture
if I denied it. If in fear of your punishment I should conceal, by a deceitful falsehood, what
I had previously been, and the fact that I had not worshipped your gods, then I might deserve
to be tormented, then I ought to be compelled to confession of my crime by the power of
suffering, as in other examinations the guilty, who deny that they are guilty of the crime of
which they are accused, are tortured in order that the confession of the reality of the crime,
which the tell-tale voice refuses to make, may be wrung out by the bodily suffering. But
now, when of my own free will I confess, and cry out, and with words frequent and repeated
to the same effect bear witness that I am a Christian, why do you apply tortures to one who
avows it, and who destroys your gods, not in hidden and secret places, but openly, and
publicly, and in the very market-place, in the hearing of your magistrates and governors;
so that, although it was a slight thing which you blamed in me before, that which you ought
rather to hate and punish has increased, that by declaring myself a Christian in a frequented
place, and with the people standing around, I am confounding both you and your gods by
an open and public announcement?</p>
<p>14. Why do you turn your attention to the weakness of our body? why do you strive
with the feebleness of this earthly flesh? Contend rather with the strength of the mind, break
down the power of the soul, destroy our faith, conquer if you can by discussion, overcome
by reason; or, if your gods have any deity and power, let them themselves rise to their own
vindication, let them defend themselves by their own majesty. But what can they advantage
their worshippers, if they cannot avenge themselves on those who worship them not? For
if he who avenges is of more account than he who is avenged, then you are greater than your
gods. And if you are greater than those whom you worship, you ought not to worship them,
but rather to be worshipped and feared by them as their lord. Your championship defends

<pb n="1069"/>
them when injured, just as your protection guards them when shut up from perishing. You
should be ashamed to worship those whom you yourself defend; you should be ashamed to
hope for protection from those whom you yourself protect.</p>
<p>15. Oh, would you but hear and see them when they are adjured by us, and tortured
with spiritual scourges, and are ejected from the possessed bodies with tortures of words,3425
when howling and groaning at the voice of man and the power of God, feeling the stripes
and blows, they confess the judgment to come! Come and acknowledge that what we say is
true; and since you say that you thus worship gods, believe even those whom you worship.
Or if you will even believe yourself, he—i.e., the demon—who has now possessed your
breast, who has now darkened your mind with the night of ignorance, shall speak concerning
yourself in your hearing. You will see that we are entreated by those whom you entreat, that
we are feared by those whom you fear, whom you adore. You will see that under our hands
they stand bound, and tremble as captives, whom you look up to and venerate as lords: assuredly
even thus you might be confounded in those errors of yours, when you see and hear
your gods, at once upon our interrogation betraying what they are, and even in your presence
unable to conceal those deceits and trickeries of theirs.</p>
<p>16. What, then, is that sluggishness of mind; yea, what blind and stupid madness of
fools, to be unwilling to come out of darkness into light, and to be unwilling, when bound
in the toils of eternal death, to receive the hope of immortality, and not to fear God when
He threatens and says, “He that sacrifices unto any gods, but unto the Lord only, shall be
rooted out?”3426 And again: “They worshipped them whom their fingers made; and the
mean man hath bowed down, and the great man hath humbled himself, and I will not forgive
them.”3427 Why do you humble and bend yourself to false gods? Why do you bow your
body captive before foolish images and creations of earth? God made you upright; and while
other animals are downlooking, and are depressed in posture bending towards the earth,
yours is a lofty attitude; and your countenance is raised upwards to heaven, and to God.
Look thither, lift your eyes thitherward, seek God in the highest, that you may be free from
things below; lift your heart to a dependence on high and heavenly things. Why do you
prostrate yourself into the ruin of death with the serpent whom you worship? Why do you
fall into the destruction of the devil, by his means and in his company? Keep the lofty estate
in which you were born. Continue such as you were made by God. To the posture of your
countenance and of your body, conform your soul. That you may be able to know God, first
know yourself. Forsake the idols which human error has invented. Be turned to God, whom
if you implore He will aid you. Believe in Christ, whom3428 the Father has sent to quicken

<pb n="1070"/>
and restore us. Cease to hurt the servants of God and of Christ with your persecutions, since
when they are injured the divine vengeance defends them.</p>
<p>17. For this reason it is that none of us, when he is apprehended, makes resistance, nor
avenges himself against your unrighteous violence, although our people are numerous and
plentiful. Our certainty of a vengeance to follow makes us patient. The innocent give place
to the guilty; the harmless acquiesce in punishments and tortures, sure and confident that
whatsoever we suffer will not remain unavenged, and that in proportion to the greatness of
the injustice of our persecution so will be the justice and the severity of the vengeance exacted
for those persecutions. Nor does the wickedness of the impious ever rise up against the
name we bear, without immediate vengeance from above attending it. To say nothing of
the memories of ancient times, and not to recur with wordy commemoration to frequently
repeated vengeance on behalf of God’s worshippers, the instance of a recent matter is sufficient
to prove that our defence, so speedily, and in its speed so powerfully, followed of late
in the ruins of things,3429 in the destruction of wealth, in the waste of soldiers, and the diminution
fortuitous, since long ago Scripture has laid down, and said, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay,
saith the Lord.”3430 And again the Holy Spirit forewarns, and says, “Say not thou, I will
avenge myself of mine enemy, but wait on the Lord, that He may be thy help.”3431 Whence
it is plain and manifest, that not by our means, but for our sakes, all those things are happening
which come down from the anger of God.</p>
<p>18. Nor let anybody think that Christians are not avenged by those things that are happening,
for the reason that they also themselves seem to be affected by their visitation. A
man feels the punishment of worldly adversity, when all his joy and glory are in the world.
He grieves and groans if it is ill with him in this life, with whom it cannot be well after this
life, all the fruit of whose life is received here, all whose consolation is ended here, whose
fading and brief life here reckons some sweetness and pleasure, but when it has departed
hence, there remains for him only punishment added to sorrow. But they have no suffering
from the assault of present evils who have confidence in future good things. In fact, we are
never prostrated by adversity, nor are we broken down, nor do we grieve or murmur in any
external misfortune or weakness of body: living by the Spirit rather than by the flesh, we
overcome bodily weakness by mental strength. By those very things which torment and
weary us, we know and trust that we are proved and strengthened.3432</p>

same adverse things are not borne equally by us and by you? Among you there is always a
clamorous and complaining impatience; with us there is a strong and religious patience,
always quiet and always grateful to God. Nor does it claim for itself anything joyous or
prosperous in this world, but, meek and gentle and stable against all the gusts of this tossing
world, it waits for the time of the divine promise; for as long as this body endures, it must
needs have a common lot with others, and its bodily condition must be common. Nor is it
given to any of the human race to be separated one from another, except by withdrawal
from this present life. In the meantime, we are all, good and evil, contained in one household.
Whatever happens within the house, we suffer with equal fate, until, when the end of the
temporal life shall be attained, we shall be distributed among the homes either of eternal
death or immortality. Thus, therefore, we are not on the same level, and equal with you,
because, placed in this present world and in this flesh, we incur equally with you the annoyances
of the world and of the flesh; for since in the sense of pain is all punishment, it is
manifest that he is not a sharer of your punishment who, you see, does not suffer pain equally
with yourselves.3433</p>
<p>20. There flourishes with us the strength of hope and the firmness of faith. Among these
very ruins of a decaying world our soul is lifted up, and our courage unshaken: our patience
is never anything but joyous; and the mind is always secure of its God, even as the Holy
Spirit speaks through the prophet, and exhorts us, strengthening with a heavenly word the
firmness of our hope and faith. “The fig-tree,” says He, “shall not bear fruit, and there shall
be no blossom in the vines. The labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no
meat. The flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls. But I
will rejoice in the Lord, and I will joy in the God of my salvation.”3434 He says that the man
of God and the worshipper of God, depending on the truth of his hope, and founded on the
stedfastness of his faith, is not moved by the attacks of this world and this life. Although the
vine should fail, and the olive deceive, and the field parched with grass dying with drought
should wither, what is this to Christians? what to God’s servants whom paradise is inviting,
whom all the grace and all the abundance of the kingdom of heaven is waiting for? They
always exult in the Lord, and rejoice and are glad in their God; and the evils and adversities
of the world they bravely suffer, because they are looking forward to gifts and prosperities
to come: for we who have put off our earthly birth, and are now created and regenerated by
the Spirit, and no longer live to the world but to God, shall not receive God’s gifts and
promises until we arrive at the presence of God. And yet we always ask for the repulse of
enemies, and for obtaining showers, and either for the removal or the moderating of adversity;

<pb n="1072"/>
and we pour forth our prayers, and, propitiating and appeasing God, we entreat constantly
and urgently, day and night, for your peace and salvation.</p>
<p>21. Let no one, however, flatter himself, because there is for the present to us and to the
profane, to God’s worshippers and to God’s opponents,3435 by reason of the equality of the
flesh and body, a common condition of worldly troubles, in such a way as to think from
this, that all those things which happen are not drawn down by you; since by the announcement
of God Himself, and by prophetic testimony, it has previously been foretold that upon
the unjust should come the wrath of God, and that persecutions which humanly would hurt
us should not be wanting; but, moreover, that vengeance, which should defend with heavenly
defence those who were hurt, should attend them.</p>
<p>22. And how great, too, are those things which in the meantime are happening in that
respect on our behalf! Something is given for an example, that the anger of an avenging God
may be known. But the day of judgment is still future which the Holy Scripture denounces,
saying, “Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is at hand, and destruction from God shall come;
for, lo, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel with wrath and anger, to lay the earth desolate,
and to destroy the sinners out of it.”3436 And again: “Behold, the day of the Lord cometh,
burning as an oven; and all the aliens and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble, and the
day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord.”3437 The Lord prophesies that the aliens
shall be burnt up and consumed; that is, aliens from the divine race, and the profane, those
who are not spiritually new-born, nor made children of God. For that those only can escape
who have been new-born and signed with the sign of Christ, God says in another place,
when, sending forth His angels to the destruction of the world and the death of the human
race, He threatens more terribly in the last time, saying, “Go ye, and smite, and let not your
eye spare. Have no pity upon old or young, and slay the virgins and the little ones and the
women, that they may be utterly destroyed. But touch not any man upon whom is written
the mark.”3438 Moreover, what this mark is, and in what part of the body it is placed, God
sets forth in another place, saying, “Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon
the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the
midst thereof.”3439 And that the sign pertains to the passion and blood of Christ, and that
whoever is found in this sign is kept safe and unharmed, is also proved by God’s testimony,
saying, “And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses in which ye shall be; and
I will see the blood, and will protect you, and the plague of diminution shall not be upon

you when I smite the land of Egypt.”3440 What previously preceded by a figure in the slain
lamb is fulfilled in Christ, the truth which followed afterwards. As, then, when Egypt was
smitten, the Jewish people could not escape except by the blood and the sign of the lamb;
so also, when the world shall begin to be desolated and smitten, whoever is found in the
blood and the sign of Christ alone shall escape.3441</p>
<p>23. Look, therefore,3442 while there is time, to the true and eternal salvation; and since
now the end of the world is at hand, turn your minds to God, in the fear of God; nor let that
powerless and vain dominion in the world over the just and meek delight you, since in the
field, even among the cultivated and fruitful corn, the tares and the darnel have dominion.
Nor say ye that ill fortunes happen because your gods are not worshipped by us; but know
that this is the judgment of God’s anger, that He who is not acknowledged on account of
His benefits may at least be acknowledged through His judgments. Seek the Lord even late;
for long ago, God, forewarning by His prophet, exhorts and says, “Seek ye the Lord, and
your soul shall live.”3443 Know God even late; for Christ at His coming admonishes and
teaches this, saying, “This is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and
Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.”3444 Believe Him who deceives not at all. Believe Him
who foretold that all these things should come to pass. Believe Him who will give to all that
believe the reward of eternal life. Believe Him who will call down on them that believe not,
eternal punishments in the fires of Gehenna.</p>
<p>24. What will then be the glory of faith? what the punishment of faithlessness? When
the day of judgment shall come, what joy of believers, what sorrow of unbelievers; that they
should have been unwilling to believe here, and now that they should be unable to return
that they might believe! An ever-burning Gehenna will burn up the condemned, and a
punishment devouring with living flames; nor will there be any source whence at any time
they may have either respite or end to their torments. Souls with their bodies will be reserved
in infinite tortures for suffering. Thus the man will be for ever seen by us who here gazed
upon us for a season; and the short joy of those cruel eyes in the persecutions that they made
for us will be compensated by a perpetual spectacle, according to the truth of Holy Scripture,
which says, “Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall
be for a vision to all flesh.”3445 And again: “Then shall the righteous men stand in great
constancy before the face of those who have afflicted them, and have taken away their labours.

When they see it, they shall be troubled with horrible fear, and shall be amazed at the suddenness
of their unexpected salvation; and they, repenting and groaning for anguish of
spirit, shall say within themselves, These are they whom we had some time in derision, and
a proverb of reproach; we fools counted their life madness, and their end to be without
honour. How are they numbered among the children of God, and their lot is among the
saints! Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath
not shined upon us, and the sun rose not on us. We wearied ourselves in the way of
wickedness and destruction; we have gone through deserts where there lay no way; but we
have not known the way of the Lord. What hath pride profited us, or what good hath the
boasting of riches done us? All those things are passed away like a shadow.”3446 The pain
of punishment will then be without the fruit of penitence; weeping will be useless, and
prayer ineffectual. Too late they will believe in eternal punishment who would not believe
in eternal life.</p>
<p>25. Provide, therefore, while you may, for your safety and your life. We offer you the
wholesome help of our mind and advice. And because we may not hate, and we please God
more by rendering no return for wrong, we exhort you while you have the power, while
there yet remains to you something of life, to make satisfaction to God, and to emerge from
the abyss of darkling superstition3447 into the bright light of true religion. We do not envy
your comforts, nor do we conceal the divine benefits. We repay kindness for your hatred;
and for the torments and penalties which are inflicted on us, we point out to you the ways
of salvation. Believe and live, and do ye who persecute us in time rejoice with us for eternity.
When you have once departed thither, there is no longer any place for repentance, and no
possibility of making satisfaction. Here life is either lost or saved; here eternal safety is
provided for by the worship of God and the fruits of faith. Nor let any one be restrained
either by his sins or by his years from coming to obtain salvation. To him who still remains
in this world no repentance is too late. The approach to God’s mercy is open, and the access
is easy to those who seek and apprehend the truth. Do you entreat for your sins, although
it be in the very end of life, and at the setting of the sun of time; and implore God, who is
the one and true God, in confession and faith of acknowledgment of Him, and pardon is
granted to the man who confesses, and saving mercy is given from the divine goodness to
the believer, and a passage is opened to immortality even in death itself. This grace Christ
bestows; this gift of His mercy He confers upon us, by overcoming death in the trophy of
the cross, by redeeming the believer with the price of His blood, by reconciling man to God
the Father, by quickening our mortal nature with a heavenly regeneration. If it be possible,
let us all follow Him; let us be registered in His sacrament and sign. He opens to us the way

of life; He brings us back to paradise; He leads us on to the kingdom of heaven. Made by
Him the children of God, with Him we shall ever live; with Him we shall always rejoice, restored
by His own blood. We Christians shall be glorious together with Christ, blessed of
God the Father, always rejoicing with perpetual pleasures in the sight of God, and ever giving
thanks to God. For none can be other than always glad and grateful, who, having been once
subject to death, has been made secure in the possession of immortality.3448</p>

<head>Treatise VI.3449</head>
<p>On the Vanity of Idols: Showing that the Idols are Not Gods, and that God is
One, and that Through Christ Salvation is Given to Believers.</p>
<p>Argument.—This Heading Embraces the Three Leading Divisions of This Treatise.
The Writer First of All Shows that They in Whose Honour Temples Were
Founded, Statues Modelled, Victims Sacrificed, and Festal Days Celebrated,
Were Kings and Men and Not Gods; And Therefore that Their Worship Could
Be of No Avail Either to Strangers or to Romans, and that the Power of the Roman
Empire Was to Attributed to Fate Rather Than to Them, Inasmuch as It Had
Arisen by a Certain Good Fortune, and Was Ashamed of Its Own Origin.3450</p>
<p>1. That those are no gods whom the common people worship, is known from this. They
were formerly kings, who on account of their royal memory subsequently began to be adored
by their people even in death. Thence temples were founded to them; thence images were
sculptured to retain the countenances of the deceased by the likeness; and men sacrificed
victims, and celebrated festal days, by way of giving them honour. Thence to posterity those
rites became sacred which at first had been adopted as a consolation. And now let us see
whether this truth is confirmed in individual instances.</p>
<p>2. Melicertes and Leucothea are precipitated into the sea, and subsequently become seadivinities.
The Castors3451 die by turns, that they may live. Æsculapius is struck by lightning,
that he may rise into a god. Hercules, that he may put off the man, is burnt up in the fires
of OEta. Apollo fed the flocks of Admetus; Neptune founded walls for Laomedon, and received—
unfortunate builder—no wages for his work. The cave of Jupiter is to be seen in
Crete, and his sepulchre is shown; and it is manifest that Saturn was driven away by him,
and that from him Latium received its name, as being his lurking-place.3452 He was the first

<note type="footnote">3450 Moreover, that it was manifest from their deceitful results, that nothing could be referred to auspices
or auguries; nay, even those who acknowledged both one God and the demons, allowed that these illusions were
the work of the demons, according to the testimony of the poets themselves, and Socrates, Plato, Trismegistus,
and Hostanes. The second point, that God is one, he makes evident in a few words, as well from the greater
dignity of a monarchy than of other forms of government, as from the very expressions of the heathen and of
the common people—“O God!” and the like. Finally, he treats of Christ more at large, from the Jewish prophets
and from the evangelical history.</note>
<note type="footnote">3451 Most editors read, “Castor and Pollux.”</note>

<pb n="1077"/>
that taught to print letters; he was the first that taught to stamp money in Italy,3453 and
thence the treasury is called the treasury of Saturn. And he also was the cultivator of the
rustic life, whence he is painted as an old man3454 carrying a sickle. Janus had received him
to hospitality when he was driven away, from whose name the Janiculum is so called, and
the month of January is appointed. He himself is portrayed with two faces, because, placed
in the middle, he seems to look equally towards the commencing and the closing year. The
Mauri, indeed, manifestly worship kings, and do not conceal their name by any disguise.</p>
<p>3. From this the religion of the gods is variously changed among individual nations and
provinces, inasmuch as no one god is worshipped by all, but by each one the worship of its
own ancestors is kept peculiar. Proving that this is so, Alexander the Great writes in the remarkable
volume addressed to his mother, that through fear of his power the doctrine of
the gods being men, which was kept secret,3455 had been disclosed to him by a priest, that
it was the memory of ancestors and kings that was (really) kept up, and that from this the
rites of worship and sacrifice have grown up. But if gods were born at any time, why are
they not born in these days also?—unless, indeed, Jupiter possibly has grown too old, or the
faculty of bearing has failed Juno.</p>
<p>4. But why do you think that the gods can avail on behalf of the Romans, when you see
that they can do nothing for their own worshipers in opposition to the Roman arms? For
we know that the gods of the Romans are indigenous. Romulus was made a god by the
perjury of Proculus, and Picus, and Tiberinus, and Pilumnus, and Consus, whom as a god
of treachery Romulus would have to be worshipped, just as if he had been a god of counsels,
when his perfidy resulted in the rape of the Sabines. Tatius also both invented and worshipped
the goddess Cloacina; Hostilius, Fear and Paleness. By and by, I know not by whom, Fever
was dedicated, and Acca and Flora the harlots.3456 These are the Roman gods. But Mars is
a Thracian, and Jupiter a Cretan, and Juno either Argive or Samian or Carthaginian, andf

<note type="footnote">3456 The following passage, accepted in some editions, is of doubtful authenticity: “To such an extent, indeed,
were feigned the names of gods among the Romans, that there is even among them a god, Viduus, who widows
the body from the soul—who, as being sad and funereal, is not kept within the walls, but placed outside; but
who nevertheless, in that he is excluded, is rather condemned by the Roman religion than worshipped. There
is also Scansus, so called from ascents, and Forculus from doors, and Limentinus from thresholds, and Cardea
from hinges, and Orbona from bereavement.”</note>

Diana of Taurus, and the mother of the gods of Ida; and there are Egyptian monsters, not
deities, who assuredly, if they had had any power, would have preserved their own and their
people’s kingdoms. Certainly there are also among the Romans the conquered Penates
whom the fugitive Æneas introduced thither. There is also Venus the bald,—far more dishonoured
by the fact of her baldness in Rome than by her having been wounded in Homer.</p>
<p>5. Kingdoms do not rise to supremacy through merit, but are varied by chance. Empire
was formerly held by both Assyrians and Medes and Persians; and we know, too, that both
Greeks and Egyptians have had dominion. Thus, in the varying vicissitudes of power, the
period of empire has also come to the Romans as to the others. But if you recur to its origin,
you must needs blush. A people is collected together from profligates and criminals, and
by founding an asylum, impunity for crimes makes the number great; and that their king
himself may have a superiority in crime, Romulus becomes a fratricide;3457 and in order to
promote marriage, he makes a beginning of that affair of concord by discords. They steal,
they do violence, they deceive in order to increase the population of the state; their marriage
consists of the broken covenants of hospitality and cruel wars with their fathers-in-law. The
consulship, moreover, is the highest degree in Roman honours, yet we see that the consulship
began even as did the kingdom. Brutus puts his sons to death, that the commendation of
his dignity may increase by the approval of his wickedness. The Roman kingdom, therefore,
did not grow from the sanctities of religion, nor from auspices and auguries, but it keeps
its appointed time within a definite limit. Moreover, Regulus observed the auspices, yet was
taken prisoner; and Mancinus observed their religious obligation, yet was sent under the
yoke. Paulus had chickens that fed, and yet he was slain at Cannæ. Caius Cæsar despised
the auguries and auspices that were opposed to his sending ships before the winter to Africa;
yet so much the more easily he both sailed and conquered.</p>
<p>6. Of all these, however, the principle is the same, which misleads and deceives, and
with tricks which darken the truth, leads away a credulous and foolish rabble. They are impure
and wandering spirits, who, after having been steeped in earthly vices, have departed
from their celestial vigour by the contagion of earth, and do not cease, when ruined themselves,
to seek the ruin of others; and when degraded themselves, to infuse into others the
error of their own degradation. These demons the poets also acknowledge, and Socrates
declared that he was instructed and ruled at the will of a demon; and thence the Magi have
a power either for mischief or for mockery, of whom, however, the chief Hostanes both says
that the form of the true God cannot be seen, and declares that true angels stand round
about His throne. Wherein Plato also on the same principle concurs, and, maintaining one
God, calls the rest angels or demons. Moreover, Hermes Trismegistus speaks of one God,
and confesses that He is incomprehensible, and beyond our estimation.</p>
<note type="footnote">3457 “Parricida.”</note>

<pb n="1079"/>
<p>7. These spirits, therefore, are lurking under the statues and consecrated images: these
inspire the breasts of their prophets with their afflatus, animate the fibres of the entrails,
direct the flights of birds, rule the lots, give efficiency to oracles, are always mixing up
falsehood with truth, for they are both deceived and they deceive;3458 they disturb their life,
they disquiet their slumbers; their spirits creeping also into their bodies, secretly terrify their
minds, distort their limbs, break their health, excite diseases to force them to worship of
themselves, so that when glutted with the steam of the altars and the piles of cattle, they may
unloose what they had bound, and so appear to have effected a cure. The only remedy from
them is when their own mischief ceases; nor have they any other desire than to call men
away from God, and to turn them from the understanding of the true religion, to superstition
with respect to themselves; and since they themselves are under punishment, (they wish)
to seek for themselves companions in punishment whom they may by their misguidance
make sharers in their crime. These, however, when adjured by us through the true God, at
once yield and confess, and are constrained to go out from the bodies possessed. You may
see them at our voice, and by the operation of the hidden majesty, smitten with stripes,
burnt with fire, stretched out with the increase of a growing punishment, howling, groaning,
entreating, confessing whence they came and when depart, even in the hearing of those very
persons who worship them, and either springing forth at once or vanishing gradually, even
as the faith of the sufferer comes in aid, or the grace of the healer effects. Hence they urge
the common people to detest our name, so that men begin to hate us before they know us,
lest they should either imitate us if known, or not be able to condemn us.3459</p>
<p>8. Therefore the one Lord of all is God. For that sublimity cannot possibly have any
compeer, since it alone possesses all power. Moreover, let us borrow an illustration for the
divine government from the earth. When ever did an alliance in royalty either begin with
good faith or end without bloodshed? Thus the brotherhood of the Thebans was broken,
and discord endured even in death in their disunited ashes. And one kingdom could not
contain the Roman twins, although the shelter of one womb had held them. Pompey and
Cæsar were kinsmen, and yet they did not maintain the bond of their relationship in their
envious power. Neither should you marvel at this in respect of man, since herein all nature
consents. The bees have one king, and in the flocks there is one leader, and in the herds one
ruler. Much rather is the Ruler of the world one; who commands all things, whatsoever they
are, with His word, disposes them by His wisdom, and accomplishes them by His power.</p>
<p>9. He cannot be seen—He is too bright for vision; nor comprehended—He is too pure
for our discernment; nor estimated—He is too great for our perception; and therefore we
are only worthily estimating Him when we say that He is inconceivable. But what temple
<note type="footnote">3458 [2 Tim. iii. 13. See vol. iii. 68.]</note>
<note type="footnote">3459 [Vol. iii. p. 111; also other apologists.]</note>

<pb n="1080"/>
can God have, whose temple is the whole world? And while man dwells far and wide, shall
I shut up the power of such great majesty within one small building? He must be dedicated
in our mind; in our breast He must be consecrated. Neither must you ask the name of God.
God is His name. Among those there is need of names where a multitude is to be distinguished
by the appropriate characteristics of appellations. To God who alone is, belongs the
whole name of God; therefore He is one, and He in His entirety is everywhere diffused. For
even the common people in many things naturally confess God, when their mind and soul
are admonished of their author and origin. We frequently hear it said, “O God,” and “God
sees,” and “I commend to God,” and “God give you,” and “as God will,” and “if God should
grant;” and this is the very height of sinfulness, to refuse to acknowledge Him whom you
cannot but know.3460</p>
<p>10. But that Christ is, and in what way salvation came to us through Him, after this
manner is the plan, after this manner is the means. First of all, favour with God was given
to the Jews. Thus they of old were righteous; thus their ancestors were obedient to their religious
engagements. Thence with them both the loftiness of their rule flourished, and the
greatness of their race advanced. But subsequently becoming neglectful of discipline, proud,
and puffed up with confidence in their fathers, they despised the divine precepts, and lost
the favour conferred upon them. But how profane became their life, what offence to their
violated religion was contracted, even they themselves bear witness, since, although they
are silent with their voice, they confess it by their end. Scattered and straggling, they wander
about; outcasts from their own soil and climate, they are thrown upon the hospitality of
strangers.3461</p>
<p>11. Moreover, God had previously foretold that it would happen, that as the ages passed
on, and the end of the world was near at hand, God would gather to Himself from every
nation, and people, and place, worshippers much better in obedience and stronger in
faith,3462 who would draw from the divine gift that mercy which the Jews had received and
lost by despising their religious ordinances. Therefore of this mercy and grace3463 the Word
and Son of God is sent as the dispenser and master, who by all the prophets of old was announced
as the enlightener and teacher of the human race. He is the power of God, He is
the reason, He is His wisdom and glory; He enters into a virgin; being the holy Spirit,3464
He is endued with flesh; God is mingled with man. This is our God, this is Christ, who, as
<note type="footnote">3460 [See vol. iii. p 179 elucidation.]</note>

<pb n="1081"/>
the mediator of the two, puts on man that He may lead them to the Father. What man is,
Christ was willing to be, that man also may be what Christ is.</p>
<p>12. And the Jews knew that Christ was to come, for He was always being announced to
them by the warnings of prophets. But His advent being signified to them as twofold—the
one which should discharge the office and example of a man, the other which should avow
Him as God—they did not understand the first advent which preceded, as being hidden in
His passion, but believe in the one only which will be manifest in power.3465 But that the
people of the Jews could not understand this, was the desert of their sins. They were so
punished by their blindness of wisdom and intelligence, that they who were unworthy of
life, had life before their eyes, and saw it not.</p>
<p>13. Therefore when Christ Jesus, in accordance with what had been previously foretold
by the prophets, drove out from men the demons by His word, and by the command of His
voice nerved up the paralytics, cleansed the leprous, enlightened the blind, gave power of
movement to the lame, raised the dead again, compelled the elements to obey Him as servants,
the winds to serve Him, the seas to obey Him, the lower regions to yield to Him; the
Jews, who had believed Him man only from the humility of His flesh and body, regarded
Him as a sorcerer for the authority of His power. Their masters and leaders—that is, those
whom He subdued both by learning and wisdom—inflamed with wrath and stimulated with
indignation,3466 finally seized Him and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate, who was then the
procurator of Syria on behalf of the Romans, demanding with violent and obstinate urgency
His crucifixion and death.</p>
<p>14. That they would do this He Himself also had foretold; and the testimony of all the
prophets had in like manner preceded Him, that it behoved Him to suffer, not that He might
feel death, but that He might conquer death, and that, when He should have suffered, He
should return again into heaven, to show the power of the divine majesty. Therefore the
course of events fulfilled the promise. For when crucified, the office of the executioner being
forestalled,3467 He Himself of His own will yielded up His spirit, and on the third day freely
rose again from the dead. He appeared to His disciples like as He had been. He gave Himself
to the recognition of those that saw Him, associated together with Him; and being evident
by the substance of His bodily existence, He delayed for forty days, that they might be instructed
by Him in the precepts of life, and might learn what they were to teach. Then in a
cloud spread around Him He was lifted up into heaven, that as a conqueror He might bring
to the Father, Man whom He loved, whom He put on, whom He shielded from death; soon
to come from heaven for the punishment of the devil and to the judgment of the human

race, with the force of an avenger and with the power of a judge; whilst the disciples, scattered
over the world, at the bidding of their Master and God gave forth His precepts for salvation,
guided men from their wandering in darkness to the way of light, and gave eyes to the blind
and ignorant for the acknowledgment of the truth.</p>
<p>15. And that the proof might not be the less substantial, and the confession of9
might not be a matter of pleasure, they are tried by tortures, by crucifixions, by many kinds
of punishments. Pain, which is the test of truth, is brought to bear, that Christ the Son of
God, who is trusted in as given to men for their life, might not only be announced by the
heralding of the voice, but by the testimony of suffering. Therefore we accompany Him, we
follow Him, we have Him as the Guide of our way, the Source of light, the Author of salvation,
promising as well the Father as heaven to those who seek and believe. What Christ is, we
Christians shall be, if we imitate Christ.</p>

<p>On the Mortality.3468</p>
<p>Argument.—The Deacon Pontius in a Few Words Unfolds the Burthen of This
Treatise in His Life of Cyprian.3469 First of All, Having Pointed Out that Afflictions
of This Kind Had Been Foretold by Christ, He Tells Them that the Mortality
or Plague Was Not to Be Feared, in that It Leads to Immortality, and that
Therefore, that Man is Wanting in Faith Who is Not Eager for a Better World.
Nor is It Wonderful that the Evils of This Life are Common to the Christians
with the Heathens, Since They Have to Suffer More Than Others in the World,
and Thence, After the Example of Job and Tobias, There is Need of Patience
Without Murmuring. For Unless the Struggle Preceded, the Victory Could Not
Ensue; And How Much Soever Diseases are Common to the Virtuous and Vicious,
Yet that Death is Not Common to Them, for that the Righteous are Taken
to Consolation, While the Unrighteous are Taken to Punishment.3470</p>
<p>1. Although in very many of you, dearly beloved brethren, there is a stedfast mind and
a firm faith, and a devoted spirit that is not disturbed at the frequency of this present mortality,
but, like a strong and stable rock, rather shatters the turbulent onsets of the world
and the raging waves of time, while it is not itself shattered, and is not overcome but tried
by these temptations; yet because I observe that among the people some, either through
weakness of mind, or through decay of faith, or through the sweetness of this worldly life,
or through the softness of their sex, or what is of still greater account, through error from
<note type="footnote">3468 Eusebius in his Chronicon makes mention of the occasion on which Cyprian wrote this treatise, saying,
“A pestilent disease took possession of many provinces of the whole world, and especially Alexandria and Egypt;
as Dionysius writes, and the treatise of Cyprian ‘concerning the Mortality’ bears witness.” a.d. 252.</note>
<note type="footnote">3469 He says: “By whom were Christians,—grieved with excessive fondness at the loss of their friends, or
what is of more consequence, with their decrease of faith,—comforted with the hope of things to come?” [See
p. 269, supra.]</note>
<note type="footnote">3470 Then to the tacit objection that by this mortality they would be deprived of martyrdom, he replies that
martyrdom is not in our power, and that even the spirit that is ready for martyrdom is crowned by God the
judge. Finally, he tells them that the dead must not be bewailed in such a matter as that we should become a
stumbling-block to the Gentiles, as if we were without the hope of a resurrection. But if also the day of our
summons should come, we must depart hence with a glad mind to the Lord, especially since we are departing
to our country, where the large number of those dear to us are waiting for us: a dense and abundant multitude
are longing for us, who, being already secure of their own immortality, are still solicitous about our salvation.</note>

the truth, are standing less steadily, and are not exerting the divine and unvanquished vigour
of their heart, the matter may not be disguised nor kept in silence, but as far as my feeble
powers suffice with my full strength, and with a discourse gathered from the Lord’s lessons,
the slothfulness of a luxurious disposition must be restrained, and he who has begun to be
already a man of God and of Christ, must be found worthy of God and of Christ.</p>
<p>2. For he who wars for God, dearest brethren, ought to acknowledge himself as one
who, placed in the heavenly camp, already hopes for3471 divine things, so that we may have
no trembling at the storms and whirlwinds of the world, and no disturbance, since the Lord
had foretold that these would come. With the exhortation of His fore-seeing word, instructing,
and teaching, and preparing, and strengthening the people of His Church for all endurance
of things to come, He predicted and said that wars, and famines, and earthquakes, and
pestilences would arise in each place; and lest an unexpected and new dread of mischiefs
should shake us, He previously warned us that adversity would increase more and more in
the last times. Behold, the very things occur which were spoken; and since those occur which
were foretold before, whatever things were promised will also follow; as the Lord Himself
promises, saying, “But when ye see all these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom
of God is at hand.”3472 The kingdom of God, beloved brethren, is beginning to be at hand;
the reward of life, and the rejoicing of eternal salvation, and the perpetual gladness3473 and
possession lately lost of paradise, are now coming, with the passing away of the world;
already heavenly things are taking the place of earthly, and great things of small, and
eternal things of things that fade away. What room is there here for anxiety and solicitude?
Who, in the midst of these things, is trembling and sad, except he who is without hope and
faith? For it is for him to fear death who is not willing to go to Christ. It is for him to be
unwilling to go to Christ who does not believe that he is about to reign3474 with</p>
<p>3. For it is written that the just lives by faith.3475 If you are just, and live by faith, if you
truly believe in Christ, why, since you are about to be with Christ, and are secure of the
Lord’s promise, do you not embrace the assurance that you are called to Christ, and rejoice
that you are freed from the devil? Certainly Simeon, that just man, who was truly just, who
kept God’s commands with a full faith, when it had been pledged him from heaven that he
should not die before he had seen the Christ, and Christ had come an infant into the temple
with His mother, acknowledged in spirit that Christ was now born, concerning whom it

<pb n="1085"/>
had before been foretold to him; and when he had seen Him, he knew that he should soon
die. Therefore, rejoicing concerning his now approaching death, and secure of his immediate
summons, he received the child into his arms, and blessing the Lord, he exclaimed, and said,
“Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word; for mine eyes have
seen Thy salvation;”3476 assuredly proving and bearing witness that the servants of God
then had peace, then free, then tranquil repose, when, withdrawn from these whirlwinds of
the world, we attain the harbour of our home and eternal security, when having accomplished
this death we come to immortality. For that is our3477 peace, that our faithful tranquillity,
that our stedfast, and abiding, and perpetual security.</p>
<p>4. But for the rest, what else in the world than a battle against the devil is daily carried
on, than a struggle against his darts and weapons in constant conflicts? Our warfare is with
avarice, with immodesty, with anger, with ambition; our diligent and toilsome wrestle with
carnal vices, with enticements of the world. The mind of man besieged, and in every quarter
invested with the onsets of the devil, scarcely in each point meets the attack, scarcely resists
it. If avarice is prostrated, lust springs up. If lust is overcome, ambition takes its place. If
ambition is despised, anger exasperates, pride puffs up, wine-bibbing entices, envy breaks
concord, jealousy cuts friendship; you are constrained to curse, which the divine law forbids;
you are compelled to swear, which is not lawful.</p>
<p>5. So many persecutions the soul suffers daily, with so many risks is the heart wearied,
and yet it delights to abide here long among the devil’s weapons, although it should rather
be our craving and wish to hasten to Christ by the aid of a quicker death; as He Himself instructs
us, and says, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the
world shall rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.”3478
Who would not desire to be without sadness? who would not hasten to attain to joy? But
when our sadness shall be turned into joy, the Lord Himself again declares, when He says,
“I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from
you.”3479 Since, therefore, to see Christ is to rejoice, and we cannot have joy unless when
we shall see Christ, what blindness of mind or what folly is it to love the world’s afflictions,
and punishments, and tears, and not rather to hasten to the joy which can never be taken
away!</p>
<p>6. But, beloved brethren, this is so, because faith is lacking, because no one believes that
the things which God promises are true, although He is true, whose word to believers is
eternal and unchangeable. If a grave and praiseworthy man should promise you anything,
<note type="footnote">3476 Luke ii. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">3477 Baluzius interpolates here, without authority, “true.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3478 John xvi. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">3479 John xvi. 22.</note>

<pb n="1086"/>
you would assuredly have faith in the promiser, and would not think that you should be
cheated and deceived by him whom you knew to be stedfast in his words and his deeds.
Now God is speaking with you; and do you faithlessly waver in your unbelieving mind? God
promises to you, on your departure from this world, immortality and eternity; and do you
doubt? This is not to know God at all; this is to offend Christ, the Teacher3480 of believers,
with the sin of incredulity; this is for one established in the Church not to have faith in the
house of faith.</p>
<p>7. How great is the advantage of going out of the world, Christ Himself, the Teacher of
our salvation and of our good works, shows to us, who, when His disciples were saddened
that He said that He was soon to depart, spoke to them, and said, “If ye loved me, ye would
surely rejoice because I go to the Father;”3481 teaching thereby, and manifesting that when
the dear ones whom we love depart from the world, we should rather rejoice than grieve.
Remembering which truth, the blessed Apostle Paul in his epistle lays it down, saying, “To
me to live is Christ, and to die is gain;”3482 counting it the greatest gain no longer to be held
by the snares of this world, no longer to be liable to the sins and vices of the flesh, but taken
away from smarting troubles, and freed from the envenomed fangs of the devil, to go at the
call of Christ to the joy of eternal salvation.</p>
<p>8. But nevertheless it disturbs some that the power of this Disease attacks our people
equally with the heathens, as if the Christian believed for this purpose, that he might have
the enjoyment of the world and this life free from the contact of ills; and not as one who
undergoes all adverse things here and is reserved for future joy. It disturbs some that this
mortality is common to us with others; and yet what is there in this world which is not
common to us with others, so long as this flesh of ours still remains, according to the law
of our first birth, common to us with them? So long as we are here in the world, we are associated
with the human race in fleshly equality,3483 but are separated in spirit. Therefore
until this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal receive immortality, and
the Spirit3484 lead us to God the Father, whatsoever are the disadvantages of the flesh are
common to us with the human race. Thus, when the earth is barren with an unproductive
harvest, famine makes no distinction; thus, when with the invasion of an enemy any city is
taken, captivity at once desolates all; and when the serene clouds withhold the rain, the
drought is alike to all; and when the jagged rocks rend the ship, the shipwreck is common

without exception to all that sail in her; and the disease of the eyes, and the attack of fevers,
and the feebleness of all the limbs is common to us with others, so long as this common
flesh of ours is borne by us in the world.</p>
<p>9. Moreover, if the Christian know and keep fast under what condition and what law
he has believed, he will be aware that he must suffer more than others in the world, since
he must struggle more with the attacks of the devil. Holy Scripture teaches and forewarns,
saying, “My son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in righteousness and fear,
and prepare thy soul for temptation.”3485 And again: “In pain endure, and in thy humility
have patience; for gold and silver is tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of
humiliation.”3486</p>
<p>10. Thus Job, after the loss of his wealth, after the death of his children, grievously afflicted,
moreover, with sores and worms, was not overcome, but proved; since in his very
struggles and anguish, showing forth the patience of a religious mind, he says, “Naked came
I out of my mother’s womb, naked also I shall go under the earth: the Lord gave, the Lord
hath taken away; as it seemed fit to the Lord, so it hath been done. Blessed be the name of
the Lord.”3487 And when his wife also urged him, in his impatience at the acuteness of his
pain, to speak something against God with a complaining and envious voice, he answered
and said, “Thou speakest as one of the foolish women. If we have received good from the
hand of the Lord, why shall we not suffer evil? In all these things which befell him, Job sinned
not with his lips in the sight of the Lord.”3488 Therefore the Lord God gives him a testimony,
saying, “Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in all the earth, a
man without complaint, a true worshipper of God.”3489 And Tobias, after his excellent
works, after the many and glorious illustrations of his merciful spirit, having suffered the
loss of his sight, fearing and blessing God in his adversity, by his very bodily affliction increased
in praise; and even him also his wife tried to pervert, saying, “Where are thy righteousnesses?
Behold what thou sufferest!”3490 But he, stedfast and firm in respect of the fear
of God, and armed by the faith of his religion to all endurance of suffering, yielded not to
the temptation of his weak wife in his trouble, but rather deserved better from God by his
greater patience; and afterwards Raphael the angel praises him, saying, “It is honourable to
show forth and to confess the works of God. For when thou didst pray, and Sara thy
daughter-in-law, I did offer the remembrance of your prayer in the presence of the glory of

God. And when thou didst bury the dead in singleness of heart, and because thou didst not
delay to rise up and leave thy dinner, and wentest and didst bury the dead, I was sent to
make proof of thee. And God again hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughter-in-law.
For I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, who are present, and go in and out before
the glory of God.”3491</p>
<p>11. Righteous men have ever possessed this endurance. The apostles maintained this
discipline from the law of the Lord, not to murmur in adversity, but to accept bravely and
patiently whatever things happen in the world; since the people of the Jews in this matter
always offended, that they constantly murmured against God, as the Lord God bears witness
in the book of Numbers, saying, “Let their murmuring cease from me, and they shall not
die.”3492 We must not murmur in adversity, beloved brethren, but we must bear with patience
and courage whatever happens, since it is written, “The sacrifice to God is a broken spirit;
a contrite and humbled heart God does not despise;”3493 since also in Deuteronomy the
Holy Spirit warns by Moses, and says, “The Lord thy God will vex thee, and will bring
hunger upon thee; and it shall be known in thine heart if thou hast well kept His command-
ments or no.”3494 And again: “The Lord your God proveth you, that He may know
whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.”3495</p>
<p>12. Thus Abraham pleased God, who, that he might please God, did not shrink even
from losing his son, or from doing an act of parricide. You, who cannot endure to lose your
son by the law and lot of mortality, what would you do if you were bidden to slay your son?
The fear and faith of God ought to make you prepared for everything, although it should
be the loss of private estate, although the constant and cruel harassment of your limbs by
agonizing disorders, although the deadly and mournful wrench from wife, from children,
from departing dear ones; Let not these things be offences to you, but battles: nor let them
weaken nor break the Christian’s faith, but rather show forth his strength in the struggle,
since all the injury inflicted by present troubles is to be despised in the assurance of future
blessings. Unless the battle has preceded, there cannot be a victory: when there shall have
been, in the onset of battle, the victory, then also the crown is given to the victors. For the
helmsman3496 is recognised in the tempest; in the warfare the soldier is proved. It is a
wanton display when there is no danger. Struggle in adversity is the trial of the truth.3497

The tree which is deeply founded in its root is not moved by the onset of winds, and the
ship which is compacted of solid timbers is beaten by the waves and is not shattered; and
when the threshing-floor brings out the corn, the strong and robust grains despise the winds,
while the empty chaff is carried away by the blast that falls upon it.</p>
<p>13. Thus, moreover, the Apostle Paul, after shipwrecks, after scourgings, after many
and grievous tortures of the flesh and body, says that he is not grieved, but benefited by his
adversity, in order that while he is sorely afflicted he might more truly be proved. “There
was given to me,” he says, “a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I
should not be lifted up: for which thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from
me; and He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in
weakness.”3498 When, therefore, weakness and inefficiency and any destruction seize us,
then our strength is made perfect; then our faith, if when tried it shall stand fast, is crowned;
as it is written, “The furnace trieth the vessels of the potter, and the trial of tribulation just
men.”3499 This, in short, is the difference between us and others who know not God, that
in misfortune they complain and murmur, while adversity does not call us away from the
truth of virtue and faith, but strengthens us by its suffering.</p>
<p>14. This trial, that now the bowels, relaxed into a constant flux, discharge the bodily
strength; that a fire originated in the marrow ferments into wounds of the fauces; that the
intestines are shaken with a continual vomiting; that the eyes are on fire with the injected
blood; that in some cases the feet or some parts of the limbs are taken off by the contagion
of diseased putrefaction; that from the weakness arising by the maiming and loss of the
body, either the gait is enfeebled, or the hearing is obstructed, or the sight darkened;—is
profitable as a proof of faith. What a grandeur of spirit it is to struggle with all the powers
of an unshaken mind against so many onsets of devastation and death! what sublimity, to
stand erect amid the desolation of the human race, and not to lie prostrate with those who
have no hope in God; but rather to rejoice,3500 and to embrace the benefit of the occasion;
that in thus bravely showing forth our faith, and by suffering endured, going forward to
Christ by the narrow way that Christ trod, we may receive the reward of His life3501 and
faith according to His own judgment! Assuredly he may fear to die, who, not being regenerated
of water and the Spirit, is delivered over to the fires of Gehenna; he may fear to die who
is not enrolled in the cross and passion of Christ; he may fear to die, who from this death
shall pass over to a second death; he may fear to die, whom on his departure from this world
eternal flame shall torment with never-ending punishments; he may fear to die who has this

advantage in a lengthened delay, that in the meanwhile his groanings and his anguish are
being postponed.</p>
<p>15. Many of our people die in this mortality, that is, many of our people are liberated
from this world. This mortality, as it is a plague to Jews and Gentiles, and enemies of Christ,
so it is a departure to salvation to God’s servants. The fact that, without any difference made
between one and another, the righteous die as well as the unrighteous, is no reason for you
to suppose that it is a common death for the good and evil alike. The righteous are called
to their place of refreshing, the unrighteous are snatched away to punishment; safety is the
more speedily given to the faithful, penalty to the unbelieving. We are thoughtless and ungrateful,
beloved brethren, for the divine benefits, and do not acknowledge what is conferred
upon us. Lo, virgins depart in peace, safe with their glory, not fearing the threats of the
coming Antichrist, and his corruptions and his brothels. Boys escape the peril of their unstable
age, and in happiness attain the reward of continence and innocence. Now the delicate
matron does not fear the tortures; for she has escaped by a rapid death the fear of persecution,
and the hands and the torments of the executioner. By the dread of the mortality and of the
time the lukewarm are inflamed, the slack are nerved up, the slothful are stimulated, the
deserters are compelled to return, the heathens are constrained to believe, the ancient congregation
of the faithful is called to rest, the new and abundant army is gathered to the battle
with a braver vigour, to fight without fear of death when the battle shall come, because it
comes to the warfare in the time of the mortality.</p>
<p>16. And further, beloved brethren, what is it, what a great thing is it, how pertinent,
how necessary, that pestilence and plague which seems horrible and deadly, searches out
the righteousness of each one, and examines the minds of the human race, to see whether
they who are in health tend the sick; whether relations affectionately love their kindred;
whether masters pity their languishing servants; whether physicians do not forsake the beseeching
patients; whether the fierce suppress their violence; whether the rapacious can
quench the ever insatiable ardour of their raging avarice even by the fear of death; whether
the haughty bend their neck; whether the wicked soften their boldness; whether, when their
dear ones perish, the rich, even then bestow anything,3502 and give, when they are to die
without heirs. Even although this mortality conferred nothing else, it has done this benefit
to Christians and to God’s servants, that we begin gladly to desire martyrdom as we learn
not to fear death. These are trainings for us, not deaths: they give the mind the glory of
fortitude; by contempt of death they prepare for the crown.</p>
<p>17. But perchance some one may object, and say, “It is this, then, that saddens me in
the present mortality, that I, who had been prepared for confession, and had devoted myself
to the endurance of suffering with my whole heart and with abundant courage, am deprived
<note type="footnote">3502 Some add, “on the poor.”</note>

<pb n="1091"/>
of martyrdom, in that I am anticipated by death.” In the first place, martyrdom is not in
your power, but in the condescension of God; neither can you say that you have lost what
you do not know whether you would deserve to receive. Then, besides, God the searcher of
the reins and heart, and the investigator and knower of secret things, sees you, and praises
and approves you; and He who sees that your virtue was ready in you, will give you a reward
for your virtue. Had Cain, when he offered his gift to God, already slain his brother? And
yet God, foreseeing the fratricide conceived in his mind, anticipated its condemnation. As
in that case the evil thought and mischievous intention were foreseen3503 by a foreseeing
God, so also in God’s servants, among whom confession is purposed and martyrdom conceived
in the mind, the intention dedicated to good is crowned by God the judge. It is one
thing for the spirit to be wanting for martyrdom, and another for martyrdom to have been
wanting for the spirit. Such as the Lord finds you when He calls you, such also He judges
you; since He Himself bears witness, and says, “And all the churches shall know that I am
the searcher of the reins and heart.”3504 For God does not ask for our blood, but for our
faith.3505 For neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob were slain; and yet, being honoured
by the deserts of faith and righteousness, they deserved to be first among the patriarchs, to
whose feast is collected every one that is found faithful, and righteous, and praiseworthy.</p>
<p>18. We ought to remember that we should do not our own will, but God’s, in accordance
with what our Lord has bidden us daily to pray. How preposterous and absurd it is, that
while we ask that the will of God should be done, yet when God calls and summons us from
this world, we should not at once obey the command of His will! We struggle and resist,
and after the manner of froward servants we are dragged to the presence of the Lord with
sadness and grief, departing hence under the bondage of necessity, not with the obedience
of free will; and we wish to be honoured with heavenly rewards by Him to whom we come
unwillingly. Why, then, do we pray and ask that the kingdom of heaven may come, if the
captivity of earth delights us? Why with frequently repeated prayers do we entreat and beg
that the day of His kingdom may hasten, if our greater desires and stronger wishes are to
obey the devil here, rather than to reign with Christ?</p>
<p>19. Besides, that the indications of the divine providence may be more evidently manifest,
proving that the Lord, prescient of the future, takes counsel for the true salvation of His
people, when one of our colleagues and fellow-priests, wearied out with infirmity, and
anxious about the present approach of death, prayed for a respite to himself; there stood by
him as he prayed, and when he was now at the point of death, a youth, venerable in honour
and majesty, lofty in stature and shining in aspect, and on whom, as he stood by him, the

human glance could scarcely look with fleshly eyes, except that he who was about to depart
from the world could already behold such a one. And he, not without a certain indignation
of mind and voice, rebuked him, and said, You fear to suffer, you do not wish to depart;
what shall I do to you? It was the word of one rebuking and warning, one who, when men
are anxious about persecution, and indifferent concerning their summons, consents not to
their present desire, but consults for the future. Our dying brother and colleague heard what
he was to say to others. For he who heard when he was dying, heard for the very purpose
that he might tell it; he heard not for himself, but for us. For what could he, who was already
on the eve of departure, learn for himself? Yea, doubtless, he learnt it for us who remain, in
order that, when we find the priest who sought for delay rebuked, we might acknowledge
what is beneficial for all.</p>
<p>20. To myself also, the very least and last, how often has it been revealed, how frequently
and manifestly has it been commanded by the condescension of God, that I should diligently
bear witness and publicly declare that our brethren who are freed from this world by the
Lord’s summons are not to be lamented, since we know that they are not lost, but sent before;
3506 that, departing from us, they precede us as travellers, as navigators are accustomed
to do; that they should be desired, but not bewailed; that the black garments should not be
taken upon us here,3507 when they have already taken upon them white raiment there; that
occasion should not be given to the Gentiles for them deservedly and rightly to reprehend
us, that we mourn for those, who, we say, are alive with God, as if they were extinct and lost;
and that we do not approve with the testimony of the heart and breast the faith which we
express with speech and word. We are prevaricators of our hope and faith: what we say appears
to be simulated, feigned, counterfeit. There is no advantage in setting forth virtue by
our words, and destroying the truth by our deeds.</p>
<p>21. Finally, the Apostle Paul reproaches, and rebukes, and blames any who are in sorrow
at the departure of their friends. “I would not,” says he, “have you ignorant, brethren, concerning
them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For
if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them which are asleep in Jesus will God
bring with Him.”3508 He says that those have sorrow in the departure of their friends who
have no hope. But we who live in hope, and believe in God, and trust that Christ suffered
for us and rose again, abiding in Christ, and through Him and in Him rising again, why
either are we ourselves unwilling to depart hence from this life, or do we bewail and grieve
for our friends when they depart as if they were lost, when Christ Himself, our Lord and

God, encourages us and says, “I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me,
though he die, yet shall live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall not die eternally?”
3509 If we believe in Christ, let us have faith in His words and promises; and since we
shall not die eternally, let us come with a glad security unto Christ, with whom we are both
to conquer and to reign for ever.</p>
<p>22. That in the meantime we die, we are passing over to immortality by death; nor can
eternal life follow, unless it should befall us to depart from this life. That is not an ending,
but a transit, and, this journey of time being traversed, a passage to eternity. Who would
not hasten to better things? Who would not crave to be changed and renewed3510 into the
likeness of Christ, and to arrive more quickly to the dignity of heavenly glory, since Paul
the apostle announces and says, “For our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we
look for the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change the body of our humiliation, and conform
it to the body of His glory?”3511 Christ the Lord also promises that we shall be such, when,
that we may be with Him, and that we may live with Him in eternal mansions, and may rejoice
in heavenly kingdoms, He prays the Father for us, saying, “Father, I will that they also
whom Thou hast given me be with me where I am, and may see the glory which Thou hast
given me before the world was made.”3512 He who is to attain to the throne of Christ, to
the glory of the heavenly kingdoms, ought not to mourn nor lament, but rather, in accordance
with the Lord’s promise, in accordance with his faith in the truth, to rejoice in this his departure
and translation.</p>
<p>23. Thus, moreover, we find that Enoch also was translated, who pleased God, as in
Genesis the Holy Scripture bears witness, and says, “And Enoch pleased God; and afterwards
he was not found, because God translated him.”3513 To have been pleasing in the sight of
God was thus to have merited to be translated from this contagion of the world. And
moreover, also, the Holy Spirit teaches by Solomon, that they who please God are more
early taken hence, and are more quickly set free, lest while they are delaying longer in this
world they should be polluted with the contagions of the world. “He was taken away,” says
he, “lest wickedness should change his understanding. For his soul was pleasing to God;
wherefore hasted He to take him away from the midst of wickedness.”3514 So also in the
Psalms, the soul that is devoted to its God in spiritual faith hastens to the Lord, saying, “How

amiable are thy dwellings, O God of hosts! My soul longeth, and hasteth unto the courts of
God.”3515</p>
<p>24. It is for him to wish to remain long in the world whom the world delights, whom
this life, flattering and deceiving, invites by the enticements of earthly pleasure. Again, since
the world hates the Christian, why do you love that which hates you? and why do you not
rather follow Christ, who both redeemed you and loves you? John in his epistle cries and
says, exhorting that we should not follow carnal desires and love the world. “Love not the
world,” says he, “neither the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the
love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, and the
lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but of the lust of the world.
And the world shall pass away, and the lust thereof; but he who doeth the will of God
abideth for ever, even as God abideth for ever.”3516 Rather, beloved brethren, with a sound
mind, with a firm faith, with a robust virtue, let us be prepared for the whole will of God:
laying aside the fear of death, let us think on the immortality which follows. By this let us
show ourselves to be what we believe, that we do not grieve over the departure of those dear
to us, and that when the day of our summons shall arrive, we come without delay and without
resistance to the Lord when He Himself calls us.</p>
<p>25. And this, as it ought always to be done by God’s servants, much more ought to be
done now—now that the world is collapsing and is oppressed with the tempests of mischievous
ills; in order that we who see that terrible things have begun, and know that still more
terrible things are imminent, may regard it as the greatest advantage to depart from it as
quickly as possible. If in your dwelling the walls were shaking with age, the roofs above you
were trembling, and the house, now worn out and wearied, were threatening an immediate
destruction to its structure crumbling with age, would you not with all speed depart? If,
when you were on a voyage, an angry and raging tempest, by the waves violently aroused,
foretold the coming shipwreck, would you not quickly seek the harbour? Lo, the world is
changing and passing away, and witnesses to its ruin not now by its age, but by the end of
things. And do you not give God thanks, do you not congratulate yourself, that by an earlier
departure you are taken away, and delivered from the shipwrecks and disasters that are
imminent?</p>
<p>26. We should consider, dearly beloved brethren—we should ever and anon reflect that
we have renounced the world, and are in the meantime living here as guests and strangers.
Let us greet the day which assigns each of us to his own home, which snatches us hence,
and sets us free from the snares of the world, and restores us to paradise and the3517 kingdom.

Who that has been placed in foreign lands would not hasten to return to his own country?
Who that is hastening to return to his friends would not eagerly desire a prosperous gale,
that he might the sooner embrace those dear to him? We regard paradise as our country—we
already begin to consider the patriarchs as our parents: why do we not hasten and run, that
we may behold our country, that we may greet our parents? There a great number of our
dear ones is awaiting us, and a dense crowd of parents, brothers, children, is longing for us,
already assured of their own safety, and still solicitous for our salvation. To attain to their
presence and their embrace, what a gladness both for them and for us in common! What a
pleasure is there in the heavenly kingdom, without fear of death; and how lofty and perpetual
a happiness with eternity of living! There the glorious company of the apostles3518—there
the host of the rejoicing prophets—there the innumerable multitude of martyrs, crowned
for the victory of their struggle and passion—there the triumphant virgins, who subdued
the lust of the flesh and of the body by the strength of their continency—there are merciful
men rewarded, who by feeding and helping the poor have done the works of righteousness—
who, keeping the Lord’s precepts, have transferred their earthly patrimonies to the
heavenly treasuries. To these, beloved brethren, let us hasten with an eager desire; let us
crave quickly to be with them, and quickly to come to Christ. May God behold this our
eager desire; may the Lord Christ look upon this purpose of our mind and faith, He who
will give the larger rewards of His glory to those whose desires in respect of Himself were
greater!</p>

<p>On Works and Alms.</p>
<p>Argument.—He Powerfully Exhorts to the Manifestation of Faith by Works, and
Enforces the Wisdom of Offerings to the Church and of Bounty to the Poor as
the Best Investment of a Christian’s Estate. This He Proves Out of Many Scriptures.</p>
<p>1. Many and great, beloved brethren, are the divine benefits wherewith the large and
abundant mercy of God the Father and Christ both has laboured and is always labouring
for our salvation: that the Father sent the Son to preserve us and give us life, in order that
He might restore us; and that the Son was willing3520 to be sent and to become the Son of
man, that He might make us sons of God; humbled Himself, that He might raise up the
people who before were prostrate; was wounded that He might heal our wounds; served,
that He might draw out to liberty those who were in bondage; underwent death, that He
might set forth immortality to mortals. These are many and great boons of divine compassion.
But, moreover, what is that providence, and how great the clemency, that by a plan of salvation
it is provided for us, that more abundant care should be taken for preserving man after
he is already redeemed! For when the Lord at His advent had cured those wounds which
Adam had borne,3521 and had healed the old poisons of the serpent,3522 He gave a law to
the sound man and bade him sin no more, lest a worse thing should befall the sinner. We
had been limited and shut up into a narrow space by the commandment of innocence. Nor
would the infirmity and weakness of human frailty have any resource, unless the divine
mercy, coming once more in aid, should open some way of securing salvation by pointing
out works of justice and mercy, so that by almsgiving we may wash away whatever foulness
we subsequently contract.3523</p>
<p>2. The Holy Spirit speaks in the sacred Scriptures, and says, “By almsgiving and faith
sins are purged.”3524 Not assuredly those sins which had been previously contracted, for
those are purged by the blood and sanctification of Christ. Moreover, He says again, “As

water extinguisheth fire, so almsgiving quencheth sin.”3525 Here also it is shown and proved,
that as in the laver of saving water the fire of Gehenna is extinguished, so by almsgiving and
works of righteousness the flame of sins is subdued. And because in baptism remission of
sins is granted once for all, constant and ceaseless labour, following the likeness of baptism,
once again bestows the mercy of God. The Lord teaches this also in the Gospel. For when
the disciples were pointed out, as eating and not first washing their hands, He replied and
said, “He that made that which is within, made also that which is without. But give alms,
and behold all things are clean unto you;”3526 teaching hereby and showing, that not the
hands are to be washed, but the heart, and that the foulness from inside is to be done away
rather than that from outside; but that he who shall have cleansed what is within has cleansed
also that which is without; and that if the mind is cleansed, a man has begun to be clean also
in skin and body. Further, admonishing, and showing whence we may be clean and purged,
He added that alms must be given. He who is pitiful teaches and warns us that pity must be
shown; and because He seeks to save those whom at a great cost He has redeemed, He teaches
that those who, after the grace of baptism, have become foul, may once more be cleansed.</p>
<p>3. Let us then acknowledge, beloved brethren, the wholesome gift of the divine mercy;
and let us, who cannot be without some wound of conscience, heal our wounds by the
spiritual remedies for the cleansing and purging of our sins. Nor let any one so flatter himself
with the notion of a pure and immaculate heart, as, in dependence on his own innocence,
to think that the medicine needs not to be applied to his wounds; since it is written, “Who
shall boast that he hath a clean heart, or who shall boast that he is pure from sins?”3527 And
again, in his epistle, John lays it down, and says, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”3528 But if no one can be without sin, and whoever
should say that he is without fault is either proud or foolish, how needful, how kind is the
divine mercy, which, knowing that there are still found some wounds in those that have
been healed, even after their healing, has given wholesome remedies for the curing and
healing of their wounds anew!</p>
<p>4. Finally, beloved brethren, the divine admonition in the Scriptures, as well old as new,
has never failed, has never been silent in urging God’s people always and everywhere to
works of mercy; and in the strain and exhortation of the Holy Spirit, every one who is in-

structed into the hope of the heavenly kingdom is commanded to give alms. God commands
and prescribes to Isaiah: “Cry,” says He, “with strength, and spare not. Lift up thy voice as
a trumpet, and declare to my people their transgressions, and to the house of Jacob their
sins.”3529 And when He had commanded their sins to be charged upon them, and with the
full force of His indignation had set forth their iniquities, and had said, that not even though
they should use supplications, and prayers, and fastings, should they be able to make
atonement for their sins; nor, if they were clothed in sackcloth and ashes, be able to soften
God’s anger, yet in the last part showing that God can be appeased by almsgiving alone, he
added, saying, “Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poor that are without a home
into thy house. If thou seest the naked, clothe him; and despise not the household of thine
own seed. Then shall thy light break forth in season, and thy garments shall arise speedily;
and righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall surround thee. Then shalt
thou cry, and God shall hear thee; whilst yet thou art speaking, He shall say, Here I am.”3530</p>
<p>5. The remedies for propitiating God are given in the words of God Himself; the divine
instructions have taught what sinners ought to do, that by works of righteousness God is
satisfied, that with the deserts of mercy sins are cleansed. And in Solomon we read, “Shut
up alms in the heart of the poor, and these shall intercede for thee from all evil.”3531 And
again: “Whoso stoppeth his ears that he may not hear the weak, he also shall call upon God,
and there will be none to hear him.”3532 For he shall not be able to deserve the mercy of the
Lord, who himself shall not have been merciful; nor shall he obtain aught from the divine
pity in his prayers, who shall not have been humane towards the poor man’s prayer. And
this also the Holy Spirit declares in the Psalms, and proves, saying, Blessed is he that considereth
of the poor and needy; the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.”3533 Remembering
which precepts, Daniel, when king Nebuchodonosor was in anxiety, being frightened by an
adverse dream, gave him, for the turning away of evils, a remedy to obtain the divine help,
saying, “Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee; and redeem thy sins by
almsgivings, and thine unrighteousness by mercies to the poor, and God will be patient3534
to thy sins.”3535 And as the king did not obey him, he underwent the misfortunes and mischiefs
which he had seen, and which he might have escaped and avoided had he redeemed
his sins by almsgiving. Raphael the angel also witnesses the like, and exhorts that alms should

be freely and liberally bestowed, saying, “Prayer is good, with fasting and alms; because alms
doth deliver from death, and it purgeth away sins.”3536 He shows that our prayers and
fastings are of less avail, unless they are aided by almsgiving; that entreaties alone are of
little force to obtain what they seek, unless they be made sufficient3537 by the addition of
deeds and good works. The angel reveals, and manifests, and certifies that our petitions become
efficacious by almsgiving, that life is redeemed from dangers by almsgiving, that souls
are delivered from death by almsgiving.</p>
<p>6. Neither, beloved brethren, are we so bringing forward these things, as that we should
not prove what Raphael the angel said, by the testimony of the truth. In the Acts of the
Apostles the faith of the fact is established; and that souls are delivered by almsgiving not
only from the second, but from the first death, is discovered by the evidence of a matter
accomplished and completed. When Tabitha, being greatly given to good works and to bestowing
alms, fell sick and died, Peter was summoned to her lifeless body; and when he,
with apostolic humanity, had come in haste, there stood around him widows weeping and
entreating, showing the cloaks, and coats, and all the garments which they had previously
received, and praying for the deceased not by their words, but by her own deeds. Peter felt
that what was asked in such a way might be obtained, and that Christ’s aid would not be
wanting to the petitioners, since He Himself was clothed in the clothing of the widows.
When, therefore, falling on his knees, he had prayed, and—fit advocate for the widows and
poor—had brought to the Lord the prayers entrusted to him, turning to the body, which
was now lying washed on the bier,3538 he said, “Tabitha, in the name of Jesus Christ,
arise!”3539 Nor did He fail to bring aid to Peter, who had said in the Gospel, that whatever
should be asked in His name should be given. Therefore death is suspended, and the spirit
is restored, and, to the marvel and astonishment of all, the revived body is quickened into
this worldly light once more; so effectual were the merits of mercy, so much did righteous
works avail! She who had conferred upon suffering widows the help needful to live, deserved
to be recalled to life by the widows’ petition.</p>
<p>7. Therefore in the Gospel, the Lord, the Teacher of our life and Master of eternal salvation,
quickening the assembly of believers, and providing for them for ever when quickened,
among His divine commands and precepts of heaven, commands and prescribes nothing
more frequently than that we should devote ourselves to almsgiving, and not depend on
earthly possessions, but rather lay up heavenly treasures. “Sell,” says He, “your goods, and
give alms.”3540 And again: “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth

and rust do corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. But lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not
break through nor steal. For where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.”3541 And
when He wished to set forth a man perfect and complete by the observation of the law,3542
He said, “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.”3543 Moreover, in another place
He says that a merchant of the heavenly grace, and a gainer of eternal salvation, ought to
purchase the precious pearl—that is, eternal life—at the price of the blood of Christ, from
the amount of his patrimony, parting with all his wealth for it. He says: “The kingdom of
heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly pearls. And when he found a precious
pearl, he went away and sold all that he had, and bought it.”3544</p>
<p>8. In fine, He calls those the children of Abraham whom He sees to be laborious in
aiding and nourishing the poor. For when Zacchæus said, “Behold, the half of my goods I
give to the poor; and if I have done any wrong to any man, I restore fourfold,” Jesus answered
and said, “That salvation has this day come to this house, for that he also is a son of Abraham.”
3545 For if Abraham believed in God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness,
certainly he who gives alms according to God’s precept believes in God, and he who has the
truth of faith maintains the fear of God; moreover, he who maintains the fear of God considers
God in showing mercy to the poor. For he labours thus because he believes—because
he knows that what is foretold by God’s word is true, and that the Holy Scripture cannot
lie—that unfruitful trees, that is, unproductive men, are cut off and cast into the fire, but
that the merciful are called into the kingdom. He also, in another place, calls laborious and
fruitful men faithful; but He denies faith to unfruitful and barren ones, saying, “If ye have
not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to you that which is true?
And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that
which is your own?”3546</p>
<p>9. If you dread and fear, lest, if you begin to act thus abundantly, your patrimony being
exhausted with your liberal dealing, you may perchance be reduced to poverty; be of good
courage in this respect, be free from care: that cannot be exhausted whence the service of
Christ is supplied, whence the heavenly work is celebrated. Neither do I vouch for this on

my own authority; but I promise it on the faith of the Holy Scriptures, and on the authority
of the divine promise. The Holy Spirit speaks by Solomon, and says, “He that giveth unto
the poor shall never lack, but he that turneth away his eye shall be in great poverty;”3547
showing that the merciful and those who do good works cannot want, but rather that the
sparing and barren hereafter come to want. Moreover, the blessed Apostle Paul, full of the
grace of the Lord’s inspiration, says: “He that ministereth seed to the sower, shall both
minister bread for your food, and shall multiply your seed sown, and shall increase the
growth of the fruits of your righteousness, that in all things ye may be enriched.”3548 And
again: “The administration of this service shall not only supply the wants of the saints, but
shall be abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;”3549 because, while thanks are
directed to God for our almsgivings and labours, by the prayer of the poor, the wealth of
the doer is increased by the retribution of God. And the Lord in the Gospel, already considering
the hearts of men of this kind, and with prescient voice denouncing faithless and unbelieving
men, bears witness, and says: “Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,
What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For these things the Gentiles
seek. And your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. Seek first the kingdom
of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”3550 He says
that all these things shall be added and given to them who seek the kingdom and righteousness
of God. For the Lord says, that when the day of judgment shall come, those who have
laboured in His Church are admitted to receive the kingdom.</p>
<p>10. You are afraid lest perchance your estate should fail, if you begin to act liberally
from it; and you do not know, miserable man that you are, that while you are fearing lest
your family property should fail you, life itself, and salvation, are failing; and whilst you are
anxious lest any of your wealth should be diminished, you do not see that you yourself are
being diminished, in that you are a lover of mammon more than of your own soul; and
while you fear, lest for the sake of yourself, you should lose your patrimony, you yourself
are perishing for the sake of your patrimony. And therefore the apostle well exclaims, and
says: “We brought nothing into this world, neither indeed can we carry anything out.
Therefore, having food and clothing, let us therewith be content. For they who will be rich
fall into temptation and a snare, and into many and hurtful desires, which drown a man in
perdition and in destruction. For covetousness is a root of all evils, which some desiring,
have made shipwreck from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.”3551</p>

<p>11. Are you afraid that your patrimony perchance may fall short, if you should begin
to do liberally from it? Yet when has it ever happened that resources3552 could fail the
righteous man, since it is written, “The Lord will not slay with famine the righteous soul?”3553
Elias in the desert is fed by the ministry of ravens; and a meal from heaven is made ready
for Daniel in the den, when shut up by the king’s command for a prey to the lions; and you
are afraid that food should be wanting to you, labouring and deserving well of the Lord, although
He Himself in the Gospel bears witness, for the rebuke of those whose mind is
doubtful and faith small, and says: “Behold the fowls of heaven, that they sow not, nor reap,
nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them: are you not of more value
than they?”3554 God feeds the fowls, and daily food is afforded to the sparrows; and to
creatures which have no sense of things divine there is no want of drink or food. Thinkest
thou that to a Christian—thinkest thou that to a servant of the Lord—thinkest thou that to
one given up to good works—thinkest thou that to one that is dear to his Lord, anything
will be wanting?</p>
<p>12. Unless you imagine that he who feeds Christ is not himself fed by Christ, or that
earthly things will be wanting to those to whom heavenly and divine things are given, whence
this unbelieving thought, whence this impious and sacrilegious consideration? What does
a faithless heart do in the home of faith? Why is he who does not altogether trust in Christ
named and called a Christian? The name of Pharisee is more fitting for you. For when in
the Gospel the Lord was discoursing concerning almsgiving, and faithfully and wholesomely
warned us to make to ourselves friends of our earthly lucre by provident good works, who
might afterwards receive us into eternal dwellings, the Scripture added after this, and said,
“But the Pharisees heard all these things, who were very covetous, and they derided Him.”3555
Some suchlike we see now in the Church, whose closed ears and darkened hearts admit no
light from spiritual and saving warnings, of whom we need not wonder that they contemn
the servant in his discourses, when we see the Lord Himself despised by such.</p>
<p>13. Wherefore do you applaud yourself in those vain and silly conceits, as if you were
withheld from good works by fear and solicitude for the future? Why do you lay out before
you certain shadows and omens of a vain excuse? Yea, confess what is the truth; and since
you cannot deceive those who know,3556 utter forth the secret and hidden things of your
mind. The gloom of barrenness has besieged your mind; and while the light of truth has
departed thence, the deep and profound darkness of avarice has blinded your carnal heart.

You are the captive and slave of your money; you are bound with the chains and bonds of
covetousness; and you whom Christ had once loosed, are once more in chains. You keep
your money, which, when kept, does not keep you.3557 You heap up a patrimony which
burdens you3558 with its weight; and you do not remember what God answered to the rich
man, who boasted with a foolish exultation of the abundance of his exuberant harvest: “Thou
fool,” said He, “this night thy soul is required of thee; then whose shall those things be which
thou hast provided?”3559 Why do you watch in loneliness over your riches? why for your
punishment do you heap up the burden of your patrimony, that, in proportion as you are
rich in this world, you may become poor to God? Divide your returns with the Lord your
God; share your gains with Christ; make Christ a partner with you in your earthly possessions,
that He also may make you a fellow-heir with Him in His heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p>14. You are mistaken, and are deceived, whosoever you are, that think yourself rich in
this world. Listen to the voice of your Lord in the Apocalypse, rebuking men of your stamp
with righteous reproaches: “Thou sayest,” says He, “I am rich, and increased with goods,
and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor,
and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be
rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness
may not appear in thee; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see.”3560
You therefore, who are rich and wealthy, buy for yourself of Christ gold tried by fire; that
you may be pure gold, with your filth burnt out as if by fire, if you are purged by almsgiving
and righteous works. Buy for yourself white raiment, that you who had been naked according
to Adam, and were before frightful and unseemly, may be clothed with the white garment
of Christ. And you who are a wealthy and rich matron in Christ’s Church,3561 anoint your
eyes, not with the collyrium of the devil,3562 but with Christ’s eye-salve, that you may be
able to attain to see God, by deserving well of God, both by good works and character.</p>
<p>15. But you who are such as this, cannot labour in the Church. For your eyes, overcast
with the gloom of blackness, and shadowed in night, do not see the needy and poor. You
are wealthy and rich, and do you think that you celebrate the Lord’s Supper, not at all considering
the offering,3563 who come to the Lord’s Supper without a sacrifice, and yet take

part of the sacrifice which the poor man has offered? Consider in the Gospel the widow that
remembered the heavenly precepts, doing good even amidst the difficulties and straits of
poverty, casting two mites, which were all that she had, into the treasury; whom when the
Lord observed and saw, regarding her work not for its abundance, but for its intention, and
considering not how much, but from how much, she had given, He answered and said,
“Verily I say unto you, that that widow hath cast in more than they all into the offerings of
God. For all these have, of that which they had in abundance, cast in unto the offerings of
God; but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.”3564 Greatly blessed and
glorious woman, who even before the day of judgment hast merited to be praised by the
voice of the Judge! Let the rich be ashamed of their barrenness and unbelief. The widow,
the widow needy in means,3565 is found rich in works. And although everything that is
given is conferred upon widows and orphans, she gives, whom it behoved to receive, that
we may know thence what punishment, awaits the barren rich man, when by this very instance
even the poor ought to labour in good works. And in order that we may understand
that their labours are given to God, and that whoever performs them deserves well of the
Lord, Christ calls this “the offerings of God,” and intimates that the widow has cast in two
farthings into the offerings of God, that it may be more abundantly evident that he who
hath pity on the poor lendeth to God.</p>
<p>16. But neither let the consideration, dearest brethren, restrain and recall the Christian
from good and righteous works, that any one should fancy that he could be excused for the
benefit of his children; since in spiritual expenditure we ought to think of Christ, who has
declared that He receives them; and not prefer our fellow-servants, but the Lord, to our
children, since He Himself instructs and warns us, saying, “He that loveth father or mother
more than me is not worthy of me, and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
worthy of me.”3566 Also in Deuteronomy, for the strengthening of faith and the love of God,
similar things are written: “Who say,” he saith, “unto their father or mother, I have not
known thee; neither did they acknowledge their children, these have observed Thy words,
and kept Thy covenant.”3567 For if we love God with our whole heart, we ought not to prefer
either our parents or children to God. And this also John lays down in his epistle, that the
love of God is not in them whom we see unwilling to labour for the poor. “Whoso,” says
he, “hath this world’s goods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels
from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?”3568 For if by almsgiving to the poor we

are lending to God—and when it is given to the least it is given to Christ—there is no ground
for any one preferring earthly things to heavenly, nor for considering human things before
divine.</p>
<p>17. Thus that widow in the third book of Kings, when in the drought and famine, having
consumed everything, she had made of the little meal and oil which was left, a cake upon
the ashes, and, having used this, was about to die with her children, Elias came and asked
that something should first be given him to eat, and then of what remained that she and her
children should eat. Nor did she hesitate to obey; nor did the mother prefer her children to
Elias in her hunger and poverty. Yea, there is done in God’s sight a thing that pleases God:
promptly and liberally is presented what is asked for. Neither is it a portion out of abundance,
but the whole out of a little, that is given, and another is fed before her hungry children; nor
in penury and want is food thought of before mercy; so that while in a saving work the life
according to the flesh is contemned, the soul according to the spirit is preserved. Therefore
Elias, being the type of Christ, and showing that according to His mercy He returns to each
their reward, answered and said: “Thus saith the Lord, The vessel of meal shall not fail, and
the cruse of oil shall not be diminished, until the day that the Lord giveth rain upon the
earth.”3569 According to her faith in the divine promise, those things which she gave were
multiplied and heaped up to the widow; and her righteous works and deserts of mercy taking
augmentations and increase, the vessels of meal and oil were filled. Nor did the mother take
away from her children what she gave to Elias, but rather she conferred upon her children
what she did kindly and piously.3570 And she did not as yet know Christ; she had not yet
heard His precepts; she did not, as redeemed by His cross and passion, repay meat and drink
for His blood. So that from this it may appear how much he sins in the Church, who, preferring
himself and his children to Christ, preserves his wealth, and does not share an abundant
estate with the poverty of the needy.</p>
<p>18. Moreover, also, (you say) there are many children at home; and the multitude of
your children checks you from giving yourself freely to good works. And yet on this very
account you ought to labour the more, for the reason that you are the father of many pledges.
There are the more for whom you must beseech the Lord. The sins of many have to be redeemed,
the consciences of many to be cleansed, the souls of many to be liberated. As in
this worldly life, in the nourishment and bringing up of children, the larger the number the
greater also is the expense; so also in the spiritual and heavenly life, the larger the number
of children you have, the greater ought to be the outlay of your labours. Thus also Job offered
numerous sacrifices on behalf of his children; and as large as was the number of the pledges
in his home, so large also was the number of victims given to God. And since there cannot
<note type="footnote">3569 1 Kings xvii. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">3570 [See p. 479, supra, note 7. [Prov. xi. 24.]</note>

<pb n="1106"/>
daily fail to be sins committed in the sight of God, there wanted not daily sacrifices wherewith
the sins might be cleansed away. The Holy Scripture proves this, saying: “Job, a true and
righteous man, had seven sons and three daughters, and cleansed them, offering for them
victims to God according to the number of them, and for their sins one calf.”3571 If, then,
you truly love your children, if you show to them the full and paternal sweetness of love,
you ought to be the more charitable, that by your righteous works you may commend your
children to God.</p>
<p>19. Neither should you think that he is father to your children who is both changeable
and infirm, but you should obtain Him who is the eternal and unchanging Father of spiritual
children. Assign to Him your wealth which you are saving up for your heirs. Let Him be
the guardian for your children; let Him be their trustee; let Him be their protector, by His
divine majesty, against all worldly injuries. The state neither takes away the property entrusted
to God, nor does the exchequer intrude on it, nor does any forensic calumny overthrow it.
That inheritance is placed in security which is kept under the guardianship of God.3572 This
is to provide for one’s dear pledges for the coming time; this is with paternal affection to
take care for one’s future heirs, according to the faith of the Holy Scripture, which says: “I
have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed
wanting bread. All the day long he is merciful, and lendeth;3573 and his seed is blessed.”3574
And again: “He who walketh without reproach in his integrity shall leave blessed children
after him.”3575 Therefore you are an unfair and traitorous father, unless you faithfully consult
for your children, unless you look forward to preserve them in religion and true piety. You
who are careful rather for their earthly than for their heavenly estate, rather to commend
your children to the devil than to Christ, are sinning twice, and allowing a double and twofold
crime, both in not providing for your children the aid of God their Father, and in teaching
your children to love their property more than Christ.</p>
<p>20. Be rather such a father to your children as was Tobias. Give useful and saving precepts
to your pledges, such as he gave to his son; command your children what he also commanded
his son, saying: “And now, my son, I command thee, serve God in truth, and do before Him
that which pleaseth Him; and command thy sons, that they exercise righteousness and alms,
and be mindful of God, and bless His name always.”3576 And again: “All the days of thy life,

most dear son, have God in your mind, and be not willing to transgress His commandments.
Do righteousness all the days of thy life, and be not willing to walk in the way of iniquity;
because if thou deal truly, there will be respect of thy works. Give alms of thy substance,
and turn not away thy face from any poor man. So shall it be, that neither shall the face of
God be turned away from thee. As thou hast, my son, so do. If thy substance is abundant,
give alms of it the more. If thou hast little, communicate of that little. And fear not when
thou doest alms; for thou layest up a good reward for thyself against the day of necessity,
because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not to come into Gehenna. Alms is
a good gift to all that give it, in the sight of the most high God.”3577</p>
<p>21. What sort of gift is it, beloved brethren, whose setting forth is celebrated in the sight
of God? If, in a gift of the Gentiles, it seems a great and glorious thing to have proconsuls
or emperors present, and the preparation and display is the greater among the givers, in
order that they may please the higher classes; how much more illustrious and greater is the
glory to have God and Christ as the spectators of the gift! How much more sumptuous the
preparation and more liberal the expense to be set forth in that case, when the powers of
heaven assemble to the spectacle, when all the angels come together: where it is not a fourhorsed
chariot or a consulship that is sought for the giver, but life eternal is bestowed; nor
is the empty and fleeting favour of the rabble grasped at, but the perpetual reward of the
kingdom of heaven is received!</p>
<p>22. And that the indolent and the barren, and those, who by their covetousness for
money do nothing in respect of the fruit of their salvation, may be the more ashamed, and
that the blush of dishonour and disgrace may the more strike upon their sordid conscience,
let each one place before his eyes the devil with his servants, that is, with the people of perdition
and death, springing forth into the midst, and provoking the people of Christ with
the trial of comparison—Christ Himself being present, and judging—in these words: “I, for
those whom thou seest with me, neither received buffets, nor bore scourgings, nor endured
the cross, nor shed my blood, nor redeemed my family at the price of my suffering and
blood; but neither do I promise them a celestial kingdom, nor do I recall them to paradise,
having again restored to them immortality. But they prepare for me gifts how precious! how
large! with how excessive and tedious a labour procured! and that, with the most sumptuous
devices either pledging or selling their means in the procuring of the gift! and, unless a
competent manifestation followed, they are cast out with scoffings and hissings, and by the
popular fury sometimes they are almost stoned! Show, O Christ, such givers as these of
Thine3578—those rich men, those men affluent with abounding wealth—whether in the
<note type="footnote">3577 Tob. iv. 5–11.</note>
<note type="footnote">3578 Some editors add here, “warned by Thy precepts, and who shall receive heavenly things instead of
earthly.”</note>

<pb n="1108"/>
Church wherein Thou presidest and beholdest, they set forth a gift of that kind,—having
pledged or scattered their riches, yea, having transferred them, by the change of their possessions
for the better, into heavenly treasures! In those spectacles of mine, perishing and
earthly as they are, no one is fed, no one is clothed, no one is sustained by the comfort either
of any meat or drink. All things, between the madness of the exhibitor and the mistake of
the spectator, are perishing in a prodigal and foolish vanity of deceiving pleasures. There,
in Thy poor, Thou art clothed and fed; Thou promisest eternal life to those who labour for
Thee; and scarcely are Thy people made equal to mine that perish, although they are honoured
by Thee with divine wages and heavenly rewards.</p>
<p>23. What do we reply to these things, dearest brethren? With what reason do we defend
the minds of rich men, overwhelmed with a profane barrenness and a kind of night of gloom?
With what excuse do we acquit them, seeing that we are less than the devil’s servants, so as
not even moderately to repay Christ for the price of His passion and blood? He has given
us precepts; what His servants ought to do He has instructed us; promising a reward to those
that are charitable, and threatening punishment to the unfruitful. He has set forth His sentence.
He has before announced what He shall judge. What can be the excuse for the laggard?
what the defence for the unfruitful? But when the servant does not do what is commanded,
the Lord will do what He threatens, seeing that He says: “When the Son of man shall come
in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then shall He sit in the throne of His glory: and
before Him shall be gathered all nations; and He shall separate them one from another, as
a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and He shall set the sheep on His right hand,
but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them that shall be on His right hand,
Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom that is prepared for you from the
foundation of the world. For I was an hungered, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick,
and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came to me. Then shall the righteous answer Him,
saying, Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, and fed Thee? thirsty, and gave Thee drink?
When saw we Thee a stranger, and took Thee in? naked, and clothed Thee? Or when saw
we Thee sick, and in prison, and came unto Thee? Then shall the King answer and say unto
them, Verily I say unto you, Insomuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren,
ye did it unto me. Then shall He say also unto those that shall be at His left hand, Depart
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father hath prepared for the devil and
his angels. For I was an hungered, and ye gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me
not to drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick,
and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer Him, saying, Lord, when
saw we Thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and
ministered not unto Thee? And He shall answer them, Verily I say unto you, In so far as ye
did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not unto me. And these shall go away into

<pb n="1109"/>
everlasting burning: but the righteous into life eternal.”3579 What more could Christ declare
unto us? How more could He stimulate the works of our righteousness and mercy, than by
saying that whatever is given to the needy and poor is given to Himself, and by saying that
He is aggrieved unless the needy and poor be supplied? So that he who in the Church is not
moved by consideration for his brother, may yet be moved by contemplation of Christ; and
he who does not think of his fellow-servant in suffering and in poverty, may yet think of
his Lord, who abideth in that very man whom he is despising.</p>
<p>24. And therefore, dearest brethren, whose fear is inclined towards God, and who having
already despised and trampled under foot the world, have lifted up your mind to things
heavenly and divine, let us with full faith, with devoted mind, with continual labour, give
our obedience, to deserve well of the Lord. Let us give to Christ earthly garments, that we
may receive heavenly raiment; let us give food and drink of this world, that we may come
with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob to the heavenly banquet. That we may not reap little,
let us sow abundantly. Let us, while there is time, take thought for our security and eternal
salvation, according to the admonition of the Apostle Paul, who says: “Therefore, while we
have time, let us labour in what is good unto all men, but especially to them that are of the
household of faith. But let us not be weary in well-doing, for in its season we shall reap.”3580</p>
<p>25. Let us consider, beloved brethren, what the congregation of believers did in the time
of the apostles, when at the first beginnings the mind flourished with greater virtues, when
the faith of believers burned with a warmth of faith as yet new. Then they sold houses and
farms, and gladly and liberally presented to the apostles the proceeds to be dispensed to the
poor; selling and alienating their earthly estate, they transferred their lands thither where
they might receive the fruits of an eternal possession, and there prepared homes where they
might begin an eternal habitation. Such, then, was the abundance in labours, as was the
agreement in love, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles: “And the multitude of them that
believed acted with one heart and one soul; neither was there any distinction among them,
nor did they esteem anything their own of the goods which belonged to them, but they had
all things common.”3581 This is truly to become sons of God by spiritual birth; this is to
imitate by the heavenly law the equity of God the Father. For whatever is of God is common
in our use; nor is any one excluded from His benefits and His gifts, so as to prevent the
whole human race from enjoying equally the divine goodness and liberality. Thus the day
equally enlightens, the sun gives radiance, the rain moistens, the wind blows, and the sleep
is one to those that sleep, and the splendour of the stars and of the moon is common. In
which example of equality,3582 he who, as a possessor in the earth, shares his returns and

his fruits with the fraternity, while he is common and just in his gratuitous bounties, is an
imitator of God the Father.</p>
<p>26. What, dearest brethren, will be that glory of those who labour charitably—how great
and high the joy when the Lord begins to number His people, and, distributing to our
merits and good works the promised rewards, to give heavenly things for earthly, eternal
things for temporal, great things for small; to present us to the Father, to whom He has restored
us by His sanctification; to bestow upon us immortality and eternity, to which He
has renewed us by the quickening of His blood; to bring us anew to paradise, to open the
kingdom of heaven, in the faith and truth of His promise! Let these things abide firmly in
our perceptions, let them be understood with full faith, let them be loved with our whole
heart, let them be purchased by the magnanimity of our increasing labours. An illustrious
and divine thing, dearest brethren, is the saving labour of charity; a great comfort of believers,
a wholesome guard of our security, a protection of hope, a safeguard of faith, a remedy for
sin, a thing placed in the power of the doer, a thing both great and easy, a crown of peace
without the risk of persecution; the true and greatest gift of God, needful for the weak,
glorious for the strong, assisted by which the Christian accomplishes spiritual grace, deserves
well of Christ the Judge, accounts God his debtor. For this palm of works of salvation let us
gladly and readily strive; let us all, in the struggle of righteousness, run with God and Christ
looking on; and let us who have already begun to be greater than this life and the world,
slacken our course by no desire of this life and of this world. If the day shall find us,
whether it be the day of reward3583 or of persecution, furnished, if swift, if running in this
contest of charity, the Lord will never fail of giving a reward for our merits: in peace He will
give to us who conquer, a white crown for our labours; in persecution, He will accompany
it with a purple one for our passion.</p>

<p>On the Advantage of Patience.3584</p>
<p>Argument.—Cyprian Himself Briefly Sets Forth the Occasion of This Treatise at the
Conclusion of His Epistle to Jubaianus as Follows: “Charity of Spirit, the Honour
of Our College, the Bond of Faith, and Priestly Concord, are Maintained by Us
with Patience and Gentleness. For This Reason, Moreover, We Have, with the
Best of Our Poor Abilities, by the Permission and Inspiration of the Lord,
Written a Pamphlet ‘On the Benefit of Patience,’ Which, for the Sake of Our
Mutual Love, We Have Transmitted to You.” a.d. 256.</p>
<p>1. As I am about to speak, beloved brethren, of patience, and to declare its advantages
and benefits, from what point should I rather begin than this, that I see that even at this
time, for your audience of me, patience is needful, as you cannot even discharge this duty
of hearing and learning without patience? For wholesome discourse and reasoning are then
effectually learnt, if what is said be patiently heard. Nor do I find, beloved brethren, among
the rest of the ways of heavenly discipline wherein the path of our hope and faith is directed
to the attainment of the divine rewards, anything of more advantage, either as more useful
for life or more helpful to glory, than that we who are labouring in the precepts of the Lord
with the obedience of fear and devotion, should especially, with our whole watchfulness, be
careful of patience.3585</p>
<p>2. Philosophers also profess that they pursue this virtue; but in their case the patience
is as false as their wisdom also is. For whence can he be either wise or patient, who has
neither known the wisdom nor the patience of God? since He Himself warns us, and says
of those who seem to themselves to be wise in this world, “I will destroy the wisdom of the
wise, and I will reprove the understanding of the prudent.”3586 Moreover, the blessed Apostle
Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, and sent forth for the calling and training of the heathen,
<note type="footnote">3584 Having at the outset distinguished true patience from the false patience of philosophers, he commends
Christian patience by the patience of God, of Christ, and of all righteous men. He further proves, as well by
Scripture as by reason, and, moreover, by the instances of Job and Tobias, that not only is patience useful, but
that it is needful also; and in order that the excellence of patience may shine forth the more by contrast with the
vice opposed to it, he sets forth what is the evil of impatience. Finally, he reproves the desire of vengeance, and
teaches that revenge ought, according to Scripture, to be left to God rather than to be arrogated to ourselves. If
in any writing Cyprian is an imitator of Tertullian, assuredly in this he imitates that writer’s treatise On Patience.

<pb n="1112"/>
bears witness and instructs us, saying, “See that no man despoil you through philosophy
and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after
Christ, because in Him dwelleth all the fulness of divinity.”3587 And in another place he
says: “Let no man deceive himself; if any man among you thinketh himself to be wise, let
him become a fool to this world, that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God. For it is written, I will rebuke the wise in their own craftiness.” And
again: “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are foolish.”3588 Wherefore
if the wisdom among them be not true, the patience also cannot be true. For if he is wise3589
who is lowly and meek—but we do not see that philosophers are either lowly or meek, but
greatly pleasing themselves, and, for the very reason that they please themselves, displeasing
God—it is evident that the patience is not real among them where there is the insolent audacity
of an affected liberty, and the immodest boastfulness of an exposed and half-naked
bosom.</p>
<p>3. But for us, beloved brethren, who are philosophers, not in words, but in deeds, and
do not put forward our wisdom in our garb, but in truth—who are better acquainted with
the consciousness, than with the boast, of virtues—who do not speak great things, but live
them,—let us, as servants and worshippers of God, show, in our spiritual obedience, the
patience which we learn from heavenly teachings. For we have this virtue in common with
God. From Him patience begins; from Him its glory and its dignity take their rise. The origin
and greatness of patience proceed from God as its author. Man ought to love the thing which
is dear to God; the good which the Divine Majesty loves, it commends. If God is our Lord
and Father, let us imitate the patience of our Lord as well as our Father; because it behoves
servants to be obedient, no less than it becomes sons not to be degenerate.</p>
<p>4. But what and how great is the patience in God, that, most patiently enduring the
profane temples and the images of earth, and the sacrilegious rites instituted by men, in
contempt of His majesty and honour, He makes the day to begin and the light of the sun to
arise alike upon the good and the evil; and while He waters the earth with showers, no one
is excluded from His benefits, but upon the righteous equally with the unrighteous He bestows
His undiscriminating rains. We see that with undistinguishing3590 equality of patience,
at God’s behest, the seasons minister to the guilty and the guiltless, the religious and the
impious—those who give thanks and the unthankful; that the elements wait on them; the
winds blow, the fountains flow, the abundance of the harvests increases, the fruits of the
vineyards ripen,3591 the trees are loaded with apples, the groves put on their leaves, the

<pb n="1113"/>
meadows their verdure; and while God is provoked with frequent, yea, with continual offences,
He softens His indignation, and in patience waits for the day of retribution, once
for all determined; and although He has revenge in His power, He prefers to keep patience
for a long while, bearing, that is to say, mercifully, and putting off, so that, if it might be
possible, the long protracted mischief may at some time be changed, and man, involved in
the contagion of errors and crimes, may even though late be converted to God, as He
Himself warns and says, “I do not will the death of him that dieth, so much as that he may
return and live.”3592 And again, “Return unto me, saith the Lord.”3593 And again: “Return
to the Lord your God; for He is merciful, and gracious, and patient, and of great pity, and
who inclines His judgment towards the evils inflicted.”3594 Which, moreover, the blessed
apostle referring to, and recalling the sinner to repentance, sets forward, and says: “Or despisest
thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing
that the patience and goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardness
and impenitent heart thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath in the day of wrath and of revelation
of the righteous judgment of God, who shall render to every one according to his
works.”3595 He says that God’s judgment is just, because it is tardy, because it is long and
greatly deferred, so that by the long patience of God man may be benefited for life eternal.3596
Punishment is then executed on the impious and the sinner, when repentance for the sin
can no longer avail.</p>
<p>5. And that we may more fully understand, beloved brethren, that patience is a thing
of God, and that whoever is gentle, and patient, and meek, is an imitator of God the Father;
when the Lord in His Gospel was giving precepts for salvation, and, bringing forth divine
warnings, was instructing His disciples to perfection, He laid it down, and said, “Ye have
heard that it is said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and have thine enemy in hatred. But I
say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them which persecute you; that ye may be
the children of your Father which is in heaven, who maketh His sun to rise on the good and
on the evil, and raineth upon the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you,
what reward shall ye have? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye shall salute your
brethren only, what do ye more (than others)? do not even the heathens the same thing? Be
ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.”3597 He said that the children

<pb n="1114"/>
of God would thus become perfect. He showed that they were thus completed, and taught
that they were restored by a heavenly birth, if the patience of God our Father dwell in us—if
the divine likeness, which Adam had lost by sin, be manifested and shine in our actions.
What a glory is it to become like to God! what and how great a felicity, to possess among
our virtues, that which may be placed on the level of divine praises!</p>
<p>6. Nor, beloved brethren, did Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, teach this in words only;
but He fulfilled it also in deeds. And because He had said that He had come down for this
purpose, that He might do the will of His Father; among the other marvels of His virtues,
whereby He showed forth the marks of a divine majesty, He also maintained the patience
of His Father in the constancy of His endurance. Finally, all His actions, even from His very
advent, are characterized by patience as their associate; in that, first of all, coming down
from that heavenly sublimity to earthly things, the Son of God did not scorn to put on the
flesh of man, and although He Himself was not a sinner, to bear the sins of others. His immortality
being in the meantime laid aside, He suffers Himself to become mortal, so that
the guiltless may be put to death for the salvation of the guilty. The Lord is baptized by the
servant; and He who is about to bestow remission of sins, does not Himself disdain to wash
His body in the laver of regeneration. For forty days He fasts, by whom others are feasted.
He is hungry, and suffers famine, that they who had been in hunger of the word and of grace
may be satisfied with heavenly bread. He wrestles with the devil tempting Him; and, content
only to have overcome the enemy, He strives no farther than by words. He ruled over His
disciples not as servants in the power of a master; but, kind and gentle, He loved them with
a brotherly love. He deigned even to wash the apostles’ feet, that since the Lord is such
among His servants, He might teach, by His example, what a fellow-servant ought to be
among his peers and equals. Nor is it to be wondered at, that among the obedient3598 He
showed Himself such, since He could bear Judas even to the last with a long patience—could
take meat with His enemy—could know the household foe, and not openly point him out,
nor refuse the kiss of the traitor. Moreover, in bearing with the Jews, how great equanimity
and how great patience, in turning the unbelieving to the faith by persuasion, in soothing
the unthankful by concession, in answering gently to the contradictors, in bearing the proud
with clemency, in yielding with humility to the persecutors, in wishing to gather together
the slayers of the prophets, and those who were always rebellious against God, even to the
very hour of His cross and passion!</p>
<p>7. And moreover, in His very passion and cross, before they had reached the cruelty of
death and the effusion of blood, what infamies of reproach were patiently heard, what
mockings of contumely were suffered, so that He received3599 the spittings of insulters, who
<note type="footnote">3598 Baluzius reads, “compares obaudientes”—His obedient peers. The mss. have “obaudientes” only.</note>
<note type="footnote">3599 Erasmus adds, “with patience.”</note>

<pb n="1115"/>
with His spittle had a little before made eyes for a blind man; and He in whose name the
devil and his angels is now scourged by His servants, Himself suffered scourgings! He was
crowned with thorns, who crowns martyrs with eternal flowers. He was smitten on the face
with palms, who gives the true palms to those who overcome. He was despoiled of His
earthly garment, who clothes others in the vesture of immortality. He was fed with gall, who
gave heavenly food. He was given to drink of vinegar, who appointed the cup of salvation.
That guiltless, that just One,—nay, He who is innocency itself and justice itself,—is counted
among transgressors, and truth is oppressed with false witnesses. He who shall judge is
judged; and the Word of God is led silently to the slaughter. And when at the cross, of the
Lord the stars are confounded, the elements are disturbed, the earth quakes, night shuts out
the day, the sun, that he may not be compelled to look on the crime of the Jews, withdraws
both his rays and his eyes, He speaks not, nor is moved, nor declares His majesty even in
His very passion itself. Even to the end, all things are borne perseveringly and constantly,
in order that in Christ a full and perfect patience may be consummated.3600</p>
<p>8. And after all these things, He still receives His murderers, if they will be converted
and come to Him; and with a saving patience, He who is benignant3601 to preserve, closes
His Church to none. Those adversaries, those blasphemers, those who were always enemies
to His name, if they repent of their sin, if they acknowledge the crime committed, He receives,
not only to the pardon of their sin, but to the reward of the heavenly kingdom. What can
be said more patient, what more merciful? Even he is made alive by Christ’s blood who has
shed Christ’s blood. Such and so great is the patience of Christ; and had it not been such
and so great, the Church would never have possessed Paul as an apostle.3602</p>
<p>9. But if we also, beloved brethren, are in Christ; if we put Him on, if He is the way of
our salvation, who follow Christ in the footsteps of salvation, let us walk by the example of
Christ, as the Apostle John instructs us, saying, “He who saith he abideth in Christ, ought
himself also to walk even as He walked.”3603 Peter also, upon whom by the Lord’s condescension
the Church was founded,3604 lays it down in his epistle, and says, “Christ suffered
for us, leaving you an example, that ye should follow His steps, who did no sin, neither was
deceit found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered,
threatened not, but gave Himself up to him that judged Him unjustly.”3605</p>

<p>10. Finally, we find that both patriarchs and prophets, and all the righteous men who
in their preceding likeness wore the figure of Christ, in the praise of their virtues were
watchful over nothing more than that they should preserve patience with a strong and
stedfast equanimity. Thus Abel, who first initiated and consecrated the origin of martyrdom,
and the passion of the righteous man, makes no resistance nor struggles against his fratricidal3606
brother, but with lowliness and meekness he is patiently slain. Thus Abraham,
believing God, and first of all instituting the root and foundation of faith, when tried in respect
of his son, does not hesitate nor delay, but obeys the commands of God with all the
patience of devotion. And Isaac, prefigured as the likeness of the Lord’s victim, when he is
presented by his father for immolation, is found patient. And Jacob, driven forth by his
brother from his country, departs with patience; and afterwards with greater patience, he
suppliantly brings him back to concord with peaceful gifts, when he is even more impious
and persecuting. Joseph, sold by his brethren and sent away, not only with patience pardons
them, but even bountifully and mercifully bestows gratuitous supplies of corn on them when
they come to him. Moses is frequently contemned by an ungrateful and faithless people,
and almost stoned; and yet with gentleness and patience he entreats the Lord for those
people. But in David, from whom, according to the flesh, the nativity of Christ springs, how
great and marvellous and Christian is the patience, that he often had it in his power to be
able to kill king Saul, who was persecuting him and desiring to slay him; and yet, chose
rather to save him when placed in his hand, and delivered up to him, not repaying his enemy
in turn, but rather, on the contrary, even avenging him when slain! In fine, so many
prophets were slain, so many martyrs were honoured with glorious deaths, who all have
attained to the heavenly crowns by the praise of patience. For the crown of sorrows and
sufferings cannot be received unless patience in sorrow and suffering precede it.</p>
<p>11. But that it may be more manifestly and fully known how useful and necessary patience
is, beloved brethren; let the judgment of God be pondered, which even in the beginning of
the world and of the human race, Adam, forgetful of the commandment, and a transgressor
of the given law, received. Then we shall know how patient in this life we ought to be who
are born in such a state, that we labour here with afflictions and contests. “Because,” says
He, “thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which alone
I had charged thee that thou shouldest not eat, cursed shall be the ground in all thy works:
in sorrow and in groaning shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns and thistles shall
it give forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the food of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt
thou eat thy bread, till thou return into the ground from which thou wast taken: for dust
thou art, and to dust shalt thou go.”3607 We are all tied and bound with the chain of this
<note type="footnote">3606 According to some, “parricidal.”</note>
<note type="footnote">3607 Gen. iii. 17–19.</note>

<pb n="1117"/>
sentence, until, death being expunged, we depart from this life. In sorrow and groaning we
must of necessity be all the days of our life: it is necessary that we eat our bread with sweat
and labour.</p>
<p>12. Whence every one of us, when he is born and received in the inn of this world, takes
his beginning from tears; and, although still unconscious and ignorant of all things, he
knows nothing else in that very earliest birth except to weep. By a natural foresight, the untrained
soul laments the anxieties and labours of the mortal life, and even in the beginning
bears witness by its wails and groans to the storms of the world which it is entering. For
the sweat of the brow and labour is the condition of life so long as it lasts. Nor can there be
supplied any consolations to those that sweat and toil other than patience; which consolations,
while in this world they are fit and necessary for all men, are especially so for us who are
more shaken by the siege of the devil, who, daily standing in the battle-field, are wearied
with the wrestlings of an inveterate and skilful enemy; for us who, besides the various and
continual battles of temptations, must also in the contest of persecutions3608 forsake our
patrimonies, undergo imprisonment, bear chains, spend our lives, endure the sword, the
wild beasts, fires, crucifixions—in fine, all kinds of torments and penalties, to be endured
in the faith and courage of patience; as the Lord Himself instructs us, and says, “These things
have I spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. But in the world ye shall have
tribulation; yet be confident, for I have overcome the world.”3609 And if we who have renounced
the devil and the world, suffer the tribulations and mischiefs of the devil and the
world with more frequency and violence, how much more ought we to keep patience,
wherewith as our helper and ally, we may bear all mischievous things!</p>
<p>13. It is the wholesome precept of our Lord and Master: “He that endureth,” saith He,
“unto the end, the same shall be saved;”3610 and again, “If ye continue,” saith He, “in my
word, ye shall be truly my disciples; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make
you free.”3611 We must endure and persevere, beloved brethren, in order that, being admitted
to the hope of truth and liberty, we may attain to the truth and liberty itself; for that very
fact that we are Christians is the substance of faith and hope. But that hope and faith may
attain to their result, there is need of patience. For we are not following after present glory,
but future, according to what Paul the apostle also warns us, and says, “We are saved by
hope; but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he hope for? But if
we hope for that which we see not, then do we by patience wait for it.”3612 Therefore, waiting

<pb n="1118"/>
and patience are needful, that we may fulfil that which we have begun to be, and may receive
that which we believe and hope for, according to God’s own showing.3613 Moreover, in
another place, the same apostle instructs the righteous and the doers of good works, and
them who lay up for themselves treasures in heaven with the increase of the divine usury,
that they also should be patient; and teaches them, saying, “Therefore, while we have time,
let us labour in that which is good unto all men, but especially to them who are of the
household of faith. But let us not faint in well-doing, for in its season we shall reap.”3614 He
admonishes that no man should impatiently faint in his labour, that none should be either
called off or overcome by temptations and desist in the midst of the praise and in the way
of glory; and the things that are past perish, while those which have begun cease to be perfect;
as it is written, “The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in whatever day
he shall transgress;”3615 and again, “Hold that which thou hast, that another take not thy
crown.”3616 Which word exhorts us to persevere with patience and courage, so that he who
strives towards the crown with the praise now near at hand, may be crowned by the continuance
of patience.</p>
<p>14. But patience, beloved brethren, not only keeps watch over what is good, but it also
repels what is evil. In harmony with the Holy Spirit, and associated with what is heavenly
and divine, it struggles with the defence of its strength against the deeds of the flesh and the
body, wherewith the soul is assaulted and taken. Let us look briefly into a few things out of
many, that from a few the rest also may be understood. Adultery, fraud, manslaughter, are
mortal crimes. Let patience be strong and stedfast in the heart; and neither is the sanctified
body and temple of God polluted by adultery, nor is the innocence dedicated to righteousness
stained with the contagion of fraud; nor, after the Eucharist carried in it,3617 is the hand
spotted with the sword and blood.</p>
<p>15. Charity is the bond of brotherhood, the foundation of peace, the holdfast and security
of unity, which is greater than both hope and faith, which excels both good works and
martyrdoms, which will abide with us always, eternal with God in the kingdom of heaven.
Take from it patience; and deprived of it, it does not endure. Take from it the substance of
bearing and of enduring, and it continues with no roots nor strength. The apostle, finally,
when he would speak of charity, joined to it endurance and patience. “Charity,” he says,
“is large-souled; charity is kind; charity envieth not, is not puffed up, is not provoked,

thinketh not evil; loveth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, beareth all
things.”3618 Thence he shows that it can tenaciously persevere, because it knows how to
endure all things. And in another place: “Forbearing one another,” he says, “in love, using
every effort to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.”3619 He proved that neither
unity nor peace could be kept unless brethren should cherish one another with mutual toleration,
and should keep the bond of concord by the intervention of patience.</p>
<p>16. What beyond;—that you should not swear nor curse; that you should not seek again
your goods when taken from you; that, when you receive a buffet, you should give your
other cheek to the smiter; that you should forgive a brother who sins against you, not only
seven times, but seventy times seven times,3620 but, moreover, all his sins altogether; that
you should love your enemies; that you should offer prayer for your adversaries and persecutors?
Can you accomplish these things unless you maintain3621 the stedfastness of patience
and endurance? And this we see done in the case of Stephen, who, when he was slain by the
Jews with violence and stoning, did not ask for vengeance for himself, but for pardon for
his murderers, saying, “Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.”3622 It behoved the first martyr
of Christ thus to be, who, fore-running the martyrs that should follow him in a glorious
death, was not only the preacher of the Lord’s passion, but also the imitator of His most
patient gentleness. What shall I say of anger, of discord, of strife, which things ought not
to be found in a Christian? Let there be patience in the breast, and these things cannot have
place there; or should they try to enter, they are quickly excluded and depart, that a peaceful
abode may continue in the heart, where it delights the God of peace to dwell. Finally, the
apostle warns us, and teaches, saying: “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye are
sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, and anger, and wrath, and clamour,
and blasphemy, be put away from you.”3623 For if the Christian have departed from rage
and carnal contention as if from the hurricanes of the sea, and have already begun to be
tranquil and meek in the harbour of Christ, he ought to admit neither anger nor discord
within his breast, since he must neither return evil for evil, nor bear hatred.</p>
<p>17. And moreover, also, for the varied ills of the flesh, and the frequent and severe torments
of the body, wherewith the human race is daily wearied and harassed, patience is

necessary. For since in that first transgression of the commandment strength of body departed
with immortality, and weakness came on with death—and strength cannot be received
unless when immortality also has been received—it behoves us, in this bodily frailty and
weakness, always to struggle and to fight. And this struggle and encounter cannot be sustained
but by the strength of patience. But as we are to be examined and searched out, diverse
sufferings are introduced; and a manifold kind of temptations is inflicted by the losses of
property, by the heats of fevers, by the torments of wounds, by the loss of those dear to us.
Nor does anything distinguish between the unrighteous and the righteous more than that
in affliction the unrighteous man impatiently complains and blasphemes, while the righteous
is proved by his patience, as it is written: “In pain endure, and in thy low estate have patience;
for gold and silver are tried in the fire.”3624</p>
<p>18. Thus Job was searched out and proved, and was raised up to the very highest pinnacle
of praise by the virtue of patience. What darts of the devil were sent forth against him! what
tortures were put in use! The loss of his estate is inflicted, the privation of a numerous offspring
is ordained for him. The master, rich in estate, and the father, richer in children, is
on a sudden neither master nor father! The wasting of wounds is added; and, moreover, an
eating pest of worms consumes his festering and wasting limbs. And that nothing at all
should remain that Job did not experience in his trials, the devil arms his wife also, making
use of that old device of his wickedness, as if he could deceive and mislead all by women,
even as he did in the beginning of the world. And yet Job is not broken down by his severe
and repeated conflicts, nor the blessing of God withheld from being declared in the midst
of those difficulties and trials of his, by the victory of patience. Tobias also, who, after the
sublime works of his justice and mercy, was tried with the loss of his eyes, in proportion as
he patiently endured his blindness, in that proportion deserved greatly of God by the praise
of patience.</p>
<p>19. And, beloved brethren, that the benefit of patience may still more shine forth, let us
consider, on the contrary, what mischief impatience may cause. For as patience is the benefit
of Christ, so, on the other hand, impatience is the mischief of the devil; and as one in whom
Christ dwells and abides is found patient, so he appears always impatient whose mind the
wickedness of the devil possesses. Briefly let us look at the very beginnings. The devil suffered
with impatience that man was made in the image of God.3625 Hence he was the first to
perish and to ruin others. Adam, contrary to the heavenly command with respect to the
deadly food, by impatience fell into death; nor did he keep the grace received from God
under the guardianship of patience. And in order that Cain should put his brother to death,
he was impatient of his sacrifice and gift; and in that Esau descended from the rights of the

<pb n="1121"/>
first-born to those of the younger, he lost his priority by impatience for the pottage. Why
was the Jewish people faithless and ungrateful in respect of the divine benefits? Was it not
the crime of impatience, that they first departed from God? Not being able to bear the delays
of Moses conferring with God, they dared to ask for profane gods, that they might call the
head of an ox and an earthen image leaders of their march; nor did they ever desist from
their impatience, until, impatient always of docility and of divine admonition, they put to
death their prophets and all the righteous men, and plunged even into the crime of the
crucifixion and bloodshedding of the Lord. Moreover, impatience makes heretics in the
Church, and, after the likeness of the Jews, drives them in opposition to the peace and
charity of Christ as rebels, to hostile and raging hatred.3626 And, not at length to enumerate
single cases, absolutely everything which patience, by its works, builds up to glory, impatience
casts down into ruin.</p>
<p>20. Wherefore, beloved brethren, having diligently pondered both the benefits of patience
and the evils of impatience, let us hold fast with full watchfulness the patience whereby we
abide in Christ, that with Christ we may attain to God; which patience, copious and manifold,
is not restrained by narrow limits, nor confined by strait boundaries. The virtue of patience
is widely manifest, and its fertility and liberality proceed indeed from a source of one name,
but are diffused by overflowing streams through many ways of glory; nor can anything in
our actions avail for the perfection of praise, unless from this it receives the substance of its
perfection. It is patience which both commends and keeps us to God. It is patience, too,
which assuages anger, which bridles the tongue, governs the mind, guards peace, rules discipline,
breaks the force of lust, represses the violence of pride, extinguishes the fire of
enmity, checks the power of the rich, soothes the want of the poor, protects a blessed integrity
in virgins, a careful purity in widows, in those who are united and married a single affection.
It makes men humble in prosperity, brave in adversity, gentle towards wrongs and contempts.
It teaches us quickly to pardon those who wrong us; and if you yourself do wrong, to entreat
long and earnestly. It resists temptations, suffers persecutions, perfects passions and martyrdoms.
It is patience which firmly fortifies the foundations of our faith. It is this which lifts
up on high the increase of our hope. It is this which directs our doing, that we may hold fast
the way of Christ while we walk by His patience. It is this that makes us to persevere as sons
of God, while we imitate our Father’s patience.</p>
<p>21. But since I know, beloved brethren, that very many are eager, either on account of
the burden or the pain of smarting wrongs, to be quickly avenged of those who act harshly

and rage against them,3627 we must not withhold the fact in the furthest particular, that
placed as we are in the midst of these storms of a jarring world, and, moreover, the persecutions
both of Jews or Gentiles, and heretics, we may patiently wait for the day of (God’s)
vengeance, and not hurry to revenge our suffering with a querulous3628 haste, since it is
written, “Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, in the day of my rising up for a testimony; for
my judgment is to the congregations of the nations, that I may take hold on the kings, and
pour out upon them my fury.”3629 The Lord commands us to wait,3630 and to bear with
brave patience the day of future vengeance; and He also speaks in the Apocalypse, saying,
“Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for now the time is at hand for them that
persevere in injuring to injure, and for him that is filthy to be filthy still; but for him that is
righteous to do things still more righteous, and likewise for him that is holy to do things
still more holy. Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to every man
according to his deeds.”3631 Whence also the martyrs, crying out and hastening with grief
breaking forth to their revenge, are bidden still to wait, and to give patience for the times
to be fulfilled and the martyrs to be completed. “And when He had opened,” says he, “the
fifth seal, I saw under the altar of God the souls of them that were slain for the word of God,
and for their testimony; and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy
and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And
there were given to them each white robes; and it was said unto them that they should rest
yet for a little season, until the number of their fellow-servants and brethren is fulfilled, who
afterwards shall be slain after their example.”3632</p>
<p>22. But when shall come the divine vengeance for the righteous blood, the Holy Spirit
declares by Malachi the prophet, saying, “Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, burning as
an oven; and all the aliens and all the wicked shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall
burn them up, saith the Lord.”3633 And this we read also in the Psalms, where the approach
of God the Judge is announced as worthy to be reverenced for the majesty of His judgment:
“God shall come manifest, our God, and shall not keep silence; a fire shall burn before Him,
and round about Him a great tempest. He shall call the heaven above, and the earth beneath,

that He may separate His people. Gather His saints together unto Him, who establish His
covenant in sacrifices; and the heavens shall declare His righteousness, for God is the
Judge.”3634 And Isaiah foretells the same things, saying: “For, behold, the Lord shall come
like a fire, and His chariot as a storm, to render vengeance in anger; for in the fire of the
Lord they shall be judged, and with His sword shall they be wounded.”3635 And again: “The
Lord God of hosts shall go forth, and shall crumble the war to pieces; He shall stir up the
battle, and shall cry out against His enemies with strength, I have held my peace; shall I always
hold my peace?”3636</p>
<p>23. But who is this that says that he has held his peace before, and will not hold his peace
for ever? Surely it is He who was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its
shearer is without voice, so He opened not His mouth. Surely it is He who did not cry, nor
was His voice heard in the streets. Surely He who was not rebellious, neither contradicted,
when He offered His back to stripes, and His cheeks to the palms of the hands; neither
turned away His face from the foulness of spitting. Surely it is He who, when He was accused
by the priests and elders, answered nothing, and, to the wonder of Pilate, kept a most patient
silence. This is He who, although He was silent in His passion, yet by and by will not be silent
in His vengeance. This is our God, that is, not the God of all, but of the faithful and believing;
and He, when He shall come manifest in His second advent, will not be silent.3637 For although
He came first shrouded in humility, yet He shall come manifest in power.</p>
<p>24. Let us wait for Him, beloved brethren, our Judge and Avenger, who shall equally
avenge with Himself the congregation of His Church, and the number of all the righteous
from the beginning of the world. Let him who hurries, and is too impatient for his revenge,
consider that even He Himself is not yet avenged who is the Avenger. God the Father ordained
His Son to be adored; and the Apostle Paul, mindful of the divine command, lays it
down, and says: “God hath exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name,
that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things heavenly, and things earthly, and
things beneath.”3638 And in the Apocalypse the angel withstands John, who wishes to worship
him,3639 and says: “See thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren.
Worship Jesus the Lord.”3640 How great is the Lord Jesus, and how great is His patience,
that He who is adored in heaven is not yet avenged on earth! Let us, beloved brethren,

and, watching with our whole heart, and stedfast to all endurance, let us keep the Lord’s

with the impious and sinners, but may be honoured with the righteous and those that fear

<p>On Jealousy and Envy.</p>
<p>Argument.3642—After Pointing Out that Jealousy or Envy is a Sin All the More
Heinous in Proportion as Its Wickedness is Hidden, and that Its Origin is to Be
Traced to the Devil, He Gives Illustrations of Envy from the Old Testament, and
Gathers, by Reference to Special Vices, that Envy is the Root of All Wickedness.
Therefore with Reason Was Fraternal Hatred Forbidden Not in One Place Only,
But by Christ and His Apostles. Finally, Exhorting to the Love of One’s Enemies
by God’s Example, He Dissuades from the Sin of Envy, by Urging the Rewards
Set Before the Indulgence of Love.</p>
<p>1. To be jealous of what you see to be good, and to be envious of those who are better
than yourself, seems, beloved brethren, in the eyes of some people to be a slight and petty
wrong; and, being thought trifling and of small account, it is not feared; not being feared,
it is contemned; being contemned, it is not easily shunned: and it thus becomes a dark and
hidden mischief, which, as it is not perceived so as to be guarded against by the prudent,
secretly distresses incautious minds. But, moreover, the Lord bade us be prudent, and charged
us to watch with careful solicitude, lest the adversary, who is always on the watch and always
lying in wait, should creep stealthily into our breast, and blow up a flame from the sparks,
magnifying small things into the greatest; and so, while soothing the unguarded and careless
with a milder air and a softer breeze, should stir up storms and whirlwinds, and bring about
the destruction of faith and the shipwreck of salvation and of life. Therefore, beloved
brethren, we must be on our guard, and strive with all our powers to repel, with solicitous
and full watchfulness, the enemy, raging and aiming his darts against every part of our body
in which we can be stricken and wounded, in accordance with what the Apostle Peter, in
his epistle, forewarns and teaches, saying, “Be sober, and watch; because your adversary the
devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking any one to devour.”3643</p>
<p>2. He goeth about every one of us; and even as an enemy besieging those who are shut
up (in a city), he examines the walls, and tries whether there is any part of the walls3644 less
firm and less trustworthy, by entrance through which he may penetrate to the inside. He

there to restrain the ill blood arising from the envenomed malignity of envy with the sweetness of a wholesome

presents to the eyes seductive forms and easy pleasures, that he may destroy chastity by the
sight. He tempts the ears with harmonious music, that by the hearing of sweet sounds he
may relax and enervate Christian vigour.3645 He provokes the tongue by reproaches; he instigates
the hand by exasperating wrongs to the wrecklessness of murder; to make the cheat,
he presents dishonest gains; to take captive the soul by money, he heaps together mischievous
hoards; he promises earthly honours, that he may deprive of heavenly ones; he makes a
show of false things, that he may steal away the true; and when he cannot hiddenly deceive,
he threatens plainly and openly, holding forth the fear of turbulent persecution to vanquish
God’s servants—always restless, and always hostile, crafty in peace, and fierce in persecution.</p>
<p>3. Wherefore, beloved brethren, against all the devil’s deceiving snares or open threat-
enings, the mind ought to stand arrayed and armed, ever as ready to repel as the foe is ever
ready to attack. And since those darts of his which creep on us in concealment are more
frequent, and his more hidden and secret hurling of them is the more severely and frequently
effectual to our wounding, in proportion as it is the less perceived, let us also be watchful
to understand and repel these, among which is the evil of jealousy and envy. And if any one
closely look into this, he will find that nothing should be more guarded against by the
Christian, nothing more carefully watched, than being taken captive by envy and malice,
that none, entangled in the blind snares of a deceitful enemy, in that the brother is turned
by envy to hatred of his brother, should himself be unwittingly destroyed by his own sword.
That we may be able more fully to collect and more plainly to perceive this, let us recur to
its fount and origin. Let us consider whence arises jealousy, and when and how it begins.
For so mischievous an evil will be more easily shunned by us, if both the source and the
magnitude of that same evil be known.3646</p>
<p>4. From this source, even at the very beginnings of the world, the devil was the first who
both perished (himself) and destroyed (others). He who3647 was sustained in angelic majesty,
he who was accepted and beloved of God, when he beheld man made in the image of God,
broke forth into jealousy with malevolent envy—not hurling down another by the instinct
of his jealousy before he himself was first hurled down by jealousy, captive before he takes
captive, ruined before he ruins others. While, at the instigation of jealousy, he robs man of
the grace of immortality conferred, he himself has lost that which he had previously been.
How great an evil is that, beloved brethren, whereby an angel fell, whereby that lofty and
illustrious grandeur could be defrauded and overthrown, whereby he who deceived was

himself deceived! Thenceforth envy rages on the earth, in that he who is about to perish by
jealousy obeys the author of his ruin, imitating the devil in his jealousy; as it is written, “But
through envy of the devil death entered into the world.”3648 Therefore they who are on his
side imitate him.3649</p>
<p>5. Hence, in fine, began the primal hatreds of the new brotherhood, hence the abominable
fratricides, in that the unrighteous Cain is jealous of the righteous Abel, in that the wicked
persecutes the good with envy and jealousy. So far prevailed the rage of envy to the consummation
of that deed of wickedness, that neither the love of his brother, nor the immensity
of the crime, nor the fear of God, nor the penalty of the sin, was considered.3650 He was
unrighteously stricken who had been the first to show righteousness; he endured hatred
who had not known how to hate; he was impiously slain, who, dying, did not resist. And
that Esau was hostile to his brother Jacob, arose from jealousy also. For because the latter
had received his father’s blessing, the former was inflamed to a persecuting hatred by the
brands of jealousy. And that Joseph was sold by his brethren, the reason of their selling him
proceeded from envy. When in simplicity, and as a brother to brethren, he set forth to them
the prosperity which had been shown to him in visions, their malevolent disposition broke
forth into envy. Moreover, that Saul the king hated David, so as to seek by often repeated
persecutions to kill him—innocent, merciful, gentle, patient in meekness—what else was
the provocation save the spur of jealousy? Because, when Goliath was slain, and by the aid
and condescension of God so great an enemy was routed, the wondering people burst forth
with the suffrage of acclamation into praises of David, Saul through jealousy conceived the
rage of enmity and persecution. And, not to go to the length of numbering each one, let us
observe the destruction of a people that perished once for all.3651 Did not the Jews perish
for this reason, that they chose rather to envy Christ3652 than to believe Him? Disparaging
those great works which He did, they were deceived by blinding jealousy, and could not
open the eyes of their heart to the knowledge of divine things.</p>
<p>6. Considering which things, beloved brethren, let us with vigilance and courage fortify
our hearts dedicated to God against such a destructiveness of evil. Let the death of others
avail for our safety; let the punishment of the unwise confer health upon the prudent.
Moreover, there is no ground for any one to suppose that evil of that kind is confined in
one form, or restrained within brief limits in a narrow boundary. The mischief of jealousy,

manifold and fruitful, extends widely. It is the root of all evils, the fountain of disasters, the
nursery of crimes, the material of transgressions. Thence arises hatred, thence proceeds
animosity. Jealousy inflames avarice, in that one cannot be content with what is his own,
while he sees another more wealthy. Jealousy stirs up ambition, when one sees another more
exalted in honours.3653 When jealousy darkens our perceptions, and reduces the secret
agencies of the mind under its command, the fear of God is despised, the teaching of Christ
is neglected, the day of judgment is not anticipated. Pride inflates, cruelty embitters, faithlessness
prevaricates, impatience agitates, discord rages, anger grows hot; nor can he who
has become the subject of a foreign authority any longer restrain or govern himself. By this
the bond of the Lord’s peace is broken; by this is violated brotherly charity; by this truth is
adulterated, unity is divided; men plunge into heresies and schisms when priests are disparaged,
when bishops are envied, when a man complains that he himself was not rather
ordained, or disdains to suffer that another should be put over him.3654 Hence the man
who is haughty through jealousy, and perverse through envy, kicks, hence he revolts, in
anger and malice the opponent, not of the man, but of the honour.</p>
<p>7. But what a gnawing worm of the soul is it, what a plague-spot of our thoughts, what
a rust of the heart, to be jealous of another, either in respect of his virtue or of his happiness;
that is, to hate in him either his own deservings or the divine benefits—to turn the advantages
of others into one’s own mischief—to be tormented by the prosperity of illustrious men—to
make other people’s glory one’s own penalty, and, as it were, to apply a sort of executioner
to one’s own breast, to bring the tormentors to one’s own thoughts and feelings, that they
may tear us with intestine pangs, and may smite the secret recesses of the heart with the
hoof of malevolence. To such, no food is joyous, no drink can be cheerful. They are ever
sighing, and groaning, and grieving; and since envy is never put off by the envious, the
possessed heart is rent without intermission day and night. Other ills have their limit; and
whatever wrong is done, is bounded by the completion of the crime. In the adulterer the
offence ceases when the violation is perpetrated; in the case of the robber, the crime is at
rest when the homicide is committed; and the possession of the booty puts an end to the
rapacity of the thief; and the completed deception places a limit to the wrong of the cheat.
Jealousy has no limit; it is an evil continually enduring, and a sin without end. In proportion
as he who is envied has the advantage of a greater success, in that proportion the envious
man burns with the fires of jealousy to an increased heat.3655</p>

<p>8. Hence the threatening countenance, the lowering aspect, pallor in the face, trembling
on the lips, gnashing of the teeth, mad words, unbridled revilings, a hand prompt for the
violence of slaughter; even if for the time deprived of a sword, yet armed with the hatred of
an infuriate mind. And accordingly the Holy Spirit says in the Psalms: “Be not jealous against
him who walketh prosperously in his way.”3656 And again: “The wicked shall observe the
righteous, and shall gnash upon him with his teeth. But God shall laugh at him; for He seeth
that his day is coming.”3657 The blessed Apostle Paul designates and points out these when
he says, “The poison of asps is under their lips, and their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
Their feet are swift to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their ways, who have
not known the way of peace; neither is the fear of God before their eyes.”3658</p>
<p>9. The mischief is much more trifling, and the danger less, when the limbs are wounded
with a sword. The cure is easy where the wound is manifest; and when the medicament is
applied, the sore that3659 is seen is quickly brought to health. The wounds of jealousy are
hidden and secret; nor do they admit the remedy of a healing cure, since they have shut
themselves in blind suffering within the lurking-places of the conscience. Whoever you are
that are envious and malignant, observe how crafty, mischievous, and hateful you are to
those whom you hate. Yet you are the enemy of no one’s well-being more than your own.
Whoever he is whom you persecute with jealousy, can evade and escape you. You cannot
escape yourself.3660 Wherever you may be, your adversary is with you; your enemy is always
in your own breast; your mischief is shut up within; you are tied and bound with the links
of chains from which you cannot extricate yourself; you are captive under the tyranny of
jealousy; nor will any consolations help you. It is a persistent evil to persecute a man who
belongs to the grace of God. It is a calamity without remedy to hate the happy.</p>
<p>10. And therefore, beloved brethren, the Lord, taking thought for this risk, that none
should fall into the snare of death through jealousy of his brother, when His disciples asked
Him which among them should be the greatest, said, “Who soever shall be least among you
all, the same shall be great.”3661 He cut off all envy by His reply.3662 He plucked out and

tore away every cause and matter of gnawing envy. A disciple of Christ must not be jealous,
must not be envious. With us there can be no contest for exaltation; from humility we grow
to the highest attainments; we have learnt in what way we may be pleasing. And finally, the
Apostle Paul, instructing and warning, that we who, illuminated by the light of Christ, have
escaped from the darkness of the conversation of night, should walk in the deeds and works
of light, writes and says, “The night has passed over, and the day is approaching: let us
therefore cast away the works of darkness, and let us put upon us the armour of light. Let
us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in lusts and wantonness,
not in strifes and jealousy.”3663 If the darkness has departed from your breast, if the night
is scattered therefrom, if the gloom is chased away, if the brightness of day has illuminated
your senses, if you have begun to be a man of light, do those things which are Christ’s, because
Christ is the Light and the Day.</p>
<p>11. Why do you rush into the darkness of jealousy? why do you enfold yourself in the
cloud of malice? why do you quench all the light of peace and charity in the blindness of
envy? why do you return to the devil, whom you had renounced? why do you stand like
Cain? For that he who is jealous of his brother, and has him in hatred, is bound by the guilt
of homicide, the Apostle John declares in his epistle, saying, “Whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer; and ye know that no murderer hath life abiding in him.”3664 And again: “He
that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now, and walketh
in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his
eyes.”3665 Whosoever hates, says he, his brother, walketh in darkness, and knoweth not
whither he goeth. For he goeth unconsciously to Gehenna, in ignorance and blindness; he
is hurrying into punishment, departing, that is, from the light of Christ, who warns and
says, “I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall
have the light of life.”3666 But he follows Christ who stands in His precepts, who walks in
the way of His teaching, who follows His footsteps and His ways, who imitates that which
Christ both did and taught; in accordance with what Peter also exhorts and warns, saying,
“Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example that ye should follow His steps.”3667</p>
<p>12. We ought to remember by what name Christ calls His people, by what title He names
His flock. He calls them sheep, that their Christian innocence may be like that of sheep; He
calls them lambs, that their simplicity of mind may imitate the simple nature of lambs. Why
does the wolf lurk under the garb of sheep? why does he who falsely asserts himself to be a

Christian, dishonour the flock of Christ? To put on the name of Christ, and not to go in the
way of Christ, what else is it but a mockery of the divine name, but a desertion of the way
of salvation; since He Himself teaches and says that he shall come unto life who keeps His
commandments, and that he is wise who hears and does His words; that he, moreover, is
called the greatest doctor in the kingdom of heaven who thus does and teaches;3668 that,
then, will be of advantage to the preacher what has been well and usefully preached, if what
is uttered by his mouth is fulfilled by deeds following? But what did the Lord more frequently
instil into His disciples, what did He more charge to be guarded and observed among His
saving counsels and heavenly precepts, than that with the same love wherewith He Himself
loved the disciples, we also should love one another? And in what manner does he keep
either the peace or the love of the Lord, who, when jealousy intrudes, can neither be peaceable
nor loving?</p>
<p>13. Thus also the Apostle Paul, when he was urging the merits of peace and charity, and
when he was strongly asserting and teaching that neither faith nor alms, nor even the passion
itself of the confessor and the martyr,3669 would avail him, unless he kept the requirements
of charity entire and inviolate, added, and said: “Charity is magnanimous, charity is kind,
charity envieth not;”3670 teaching, doubtless, and showing that whoever is magnanimous,
and kind, and averse from jealousy and rancour, such a one can maintain charity. Moreover,
in another place, when he was advising that the man who has already become filled with
the Holy Spirit, and a son of God by heavenly birth, should observe nothing but spiritual
and divine things, he lays it down, and says: “And I indeed, brethren, could not speak unto
you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with
milk, not with meat:3671 for ye were not able hitherto; moreover, neither now are ye able.
For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there are still among you jealousy, and contention, and
strifes, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?”3672</p>
<p>14. Vices and carnal sins must be trampled down, beloved brethren, and the corrupting
plague of the earthly body must be trodden under foot with spiritual vigour, lest, while we
are turned back again to the conversation of the old man, we be entangled in deadly snares,
even as the apostle, with foresight and wholesomeness, forewarned us of this very thing,
and said: “Therefore, brethren, let us not live after the flesh; for if ye live after the flesh, ye
shall begin to die; but if ye, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.

For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”3673 If we are the sons
of God, if we are already beginning to be His temples, if, having received the Holy Spirit,
we are living holily and spiritually, if we have raised our eyes from earth to heaven, if we
have lifted our hearts, filled with God and Christ, to things above and divine, let us do
nothing but what is worthy of God and Christ, even as the apostle arouses and exhorts us,
saying: “If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is sitting
at the right hand of God; occupy your minds with things that are above, not with things
which are upon the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. But when
Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory.”3674 Let
us, then, who in baptism have both died and been buried in respect of the carnal sins of the
old man, who have risen again with Christ in the heavenly regeneration, both think upon
and do the things which are Christ’s, even as the same apostle again teaches and counsels,
saying: “The first man is of the dust of the earth; the second man is from heaven. Such as
he is from the earth, such also are they who are from the earth and such as He the heavenly
is, such also are they who are heavenly. As we have borne the image of him who is of the
earth, let us also bear the image of Him who is from heaven.”3675 But we cannot bear the
heavenly image, unless in that condition wherein we have already begun to be, we show
forth the likeness of Christ.</p>
<p>15. For this is to change what you had been, and to begin to be what you were not, that
the divine birth might shine forth in you, that the godly discipline might respond to God,
the Father, that in the honour and praise of living, God may be glorified in man; as He
Himself exhorts, and warns, and promises to those who glorify Him a reward in their turn,
saying, “Them that glorify me I will glorify, and he who despiseth me shall be despised.”3676
For which glorification the Lord, forming and preparing us, and the Son of God instilling3677
the likeness of God the Father, says in His Gospel: “Ye have heard that it hath been said,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies,
and pray for them which persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which
is in heaven, who maketh His sun to rise on the good and on the evil, and sendeth rain upon
the just and on the unjust.”3678 If it is a source of joy and glory to men to have children like
to themselves—and it is more agreeable to have begotten an offspring then when the remaining3679
progeny responds to the parent with like lineaments—how much greater is the

gladness in God the Father, when any one is so spiritually born that in his acts and praises
the divine eminence of race3680 is announced! What a palm of righteousness is it, what a
crown to be such a one3681 as that the Lord should not say of you, “I have begotten and
brought up children, but they have despised me!”3682 Let Christ rather applaud you, and
invite you to the reward, saying, “Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom which
is prepared for you from the beginning of the world.”3683</p>
<p>16. The mind must be strengthened, beloved brethren, by these meditations. By exercises
of this kind it must be confirmed against all the darts of the devil. Let there be the divine
reading in the hands,3684 the Lord’s thoughts in the mind; let constant prayer never cease
at all; let saving labour persevere. Let us be always busied in spiritual actions, that so often
as the enemy approaches, however often he may try to come near, he may find the breast
closed and armed against him. For a Christian man’s crown is not only that which is received
in the time of persecution: peace3685 also has its crowns, wherewith the victors, from a varied
and manifold engagement, are crowned, when their adversary is prostrated and subdued.
To have overcome lust is the palm of continency. To have resisted against anger, against
injury, is the crown of patience. It is a triumph over avarice to despise money. It is the praise
of faith, by trust in the future, to suffer the adversity of the world. And he who is not haughty
in prosperity, obtains glory for his humility; and he who is disposed to the mercifulness of
cherishing the poor, obtains the retribution of a heavenly treasure; and he who knows not
to be jealous, and who with one heart and in meekness loves his brethren, is honoured with
the recompense of love and peace. In this course of virtues we daily run; to these palms and
crowns of justice we attain without intermission of time.</p>
<p>17. To these rewards that you also may come who had been possessed with jealousy and
rancour, cast away all that malice wherewith you were before held fast, and be reformed to
the way of eternal life in the footsteps of salvation. Tear out from your breast thorns and
thistles, that the Lord’s seed may enrich you with a fertile produce, that the divine and
spiritual cornfield may abound to the plentifulness of a fruitful harvest. Cast out the poison
of gall, cast out the virus of discords. Let the mind which the malice3686 of the serpent had
infected be purged; let all bitterness which had settled within be softened by the sweetness

of Christ. If you take both meat and drink from the sacrament of the cross, let the wood
which at Mara3687 availed in a figure for sweetening the taste, avail to you in reality for
soothing your softened breast; and you shall not strive for a medicine for your increasing
health. Be cured by that whereby you had been wounded.3688 Love those whom you previously
had hated; favour those whom you envied with unjust disparagements. Imitate good
men, if you are able to follow them; but if you are not able to follow them, at least rejoice
with them, and congratulate those who are better than you. Make yourself a sharer3689 with
them in united love; make yourself their associate in the alliance of charity and the bond of
brotherhood. Your debts shall be remitted to you when you yourself shall have forgiven.
Your sacrifices shall be received when you shall come in peace to God. Your thoughts and
deeds shall be directed from above, when you consider those things which are divine and
righteous, as it is written: “Let the heart of a man consider righteous things, that his steps
may be directed by the Lord.”3690</p>
<p>18. And you have many things to consider. Think of paradise, whither Cain does not
enter,3691 who by jealousy slew his brother. Think of the heavenly kingdom, to which the
Lord does not admit any but those who are of one heart and mind. Consider that those
alone can be called sons of God who are peacemakers, who in heavenly3692 birth and by the
divine law are made one, and respond to the likeness of God the Father and of Christ.
Consider that we are standing under the eyes of God, that we are pursuing the course of
our conversation and our life, with God Himself looking on and judging, that we may then
at length be able to attain to the result of beholding Him, if we now delight Him who sees
us, by our actions, if we show ourselves worthy of His favour and indulgence; if we, who
are always to please Him in His kingdom, previously please Him in the world.</p>

<p>Exhortation to Martyrdom, Addressed to Fortunatus.</p>
 
<div type="commentary" subtype="preface">
<head>Preface.</head>
<p>1. You have desired, beloved Fortunatus3694 that, since the burden of persecutions and
afflictions is lying heavy upon us, and in the ending and completion of the world the hateful
time of Antichrist is already beginning to draw near,3695 I would collect from the sacred
Scriptures some exhortations for preparing and strengthening the minds of the brethren,
whereby I might animate the soldiers of Christ for the heavenly and spiritual contest. I have
been constrained to obey your so needful wish, so that as much as my limited powers, instructed
by the aid of divine inspiration, are sufficient, some arms, as it were, and defences
might be brought forth from the Lord’s precepts for the brethren who are about to fight.
For it is little to arouse God’s people by the trumpet call of our voice, unless we confirm the
faith of believers, and their valour dedicated and devoted to God, by the divine readings.3696</p>
<p>2. But what more fitly or more fully agrees with my own care and solicitude, than to
prepare the people divinely entrusted to me, and an army established in the heavenly camp,
by assiduous exhortations against the darts and weapons of the devil? For he cannot be a
soldier fitted for the war who has not first been exercised in the field; nor will he who seeks
to gain the crown of contest be rewarded on the racecourse, unless he first considers the use
and skilfulness of his powers. It is an ancient adversary and an old enemy with whom we
wage our battle: six thousand years are now nearly completed since the devil first attacked
man.3697 All kinds of temptation, and arts, and snares for his overthrow, he has learned by
the very practice of long years. If he finds Christ’s soldier unprepared, if unskilled, if not
careful and watching with his whole heart; he circumvents him if ignorant, he deceives him
incautious, he cheats him inexperienced. But if a man, keeping the Lord’s precepts, and
bravely adhering to Christ,3698 stands against him, he must needs be conquered, because
Christ, whom that man confesses, is unconquered.</p>

<p>3. And that I might not extend my discourse, beloved brother, to too great a length, and
fatigue my hearer or reader by the abundance of a too diffuse style, I have made a compendium;
so that the titles being placed first, which every one ought both to know and to have
in mind, I might subjoin sections of the Lord’s word, and establish what I had proposed by
the authority of the divine teaching, in such wise as that I might not appear to have sent you
my own treatise so much, as to have suggested material for others to discourse on; a proceeding
which will be of advantage to individuals with increased benefit. For if I were to give a
man a garment finished and ready, it would be my garment that another was making use
of, and probably the thing made for another would be found little fitting for his figure of
stature and body. But now I have sent you the very wool and the purple3699 from the Lamb,
by whom we were redeemed and quickened; which, when you have received, you will make
into a coat for yourself according to your own will, and the rather that you will rejoice in it
as your own private and special garment. And you will exhibit to others also what we have
sent, that they themselves may be able to finish it according to their will; so that that old
nakedness being covered, they may all bear the garments of Christ robed in the sanctification
of heavenly grace.</p>
<p>4. Moreover also, beloved brethren, I have considered it a useful and wholesome plan
in an exhortation so needful as that which may make martyrs, to cut off all delays and
tardiness in our words, and to put away the windings of human discourse, and set down
only those things which God speaks, wherewith Christ exhorts His servants to martyrdom.
Those divine precepts themselves must be supplied, as it were, for arms for the combatants.
Let them be the incitements of the warlike trumpet; let them be the clarion-blast for the
warriors. Let the ears be roused by them; let the minds be prepared by them; let the powers
both of soul and body be strengthened to all endurance of suffering. Let us only who, by the
Lord’s permission, have given the first baptism to believers, also prepare each one for the
second; urging and teaching that this is a baptism greater in grace, more lofty in power,
more precious in honour—a baptism wherein angels baptize—a baptism in which God and
His Christ exult—a baptism after which no one sins any more3700—a baptism which completes
the increase of our faith—a baptism which, as we withdraw from the world, immediately
associates us with God. In the baptism of water is received the remission of sins, in the
baptism of blood the crown of virtues. This thing is to be embraced and desired, and to be
asked for in all the entreaties of our petitions, that we who are God’s servants should be also
His friends.</p>

<head>Heads of the Following Book.</head>
<p>1. Therefore, in exhorting and preparing our brethren, and in arming them with firmness
of virtue and faith for the heralding forth of the confession of the Lord, and for the battle
of persecution and suffering, we must declare, in the first place, that the idols which man
makes for himself are not gods. For things which are made are not greater than their maker
and fashioner; nor can these things protect and preserve anybody, which themselves perish
out of their temples, unless they are preserved by man. But neither are those elements to be
worshipped3701 which serve man according to the disposition and ordinance of God.</p>
<p>2. The idols being destroyed, and the truth concerning the elements being manifested,
we must show that God only is to be worshipped.</p>
<p>3. Then we must add, what is God’s threatening against those who sacrifice to idols.</p>
<p>4. Besides, we must teach that God does not easily pardon idolaters.</p>
<p>5. And that God is so angry with idolatry, that He has even commanded those to be
slain who persuade others to sacrifice and serve idols.</p>
<p>6. After this we must subjoin, that being redeemed and quickened by the blood of Christ,
we ought to prefer nothing to Christ, because He preferred nothing to us, and on our account
preferred evil things to good, poverty to riches, servitude to rule, death to immortality; that
we, on the contrary, in our sufferings are preferring the riches and delights of paradise to
the poverty of the world, eternal dominion and kingdom to the slavery of time, immortality
to death, God and Christ to the devil and Antichrist.</p>
<p>7. We must urge also, that when snatched from the jaws of the devil, and freed from the
snares of this world, if they begin to be in difficulty and trouble, they must not desire to return
again to the world, and so lose the advantage of their withdrawal therefrom.</p>
<p>8. That we must rather urge on and persevere in faith and virtue, and in completion of
heavenly and spiritual grace, that we may attain to the palm and to the crown.</p>
<p>9. For that afflictions and persecutions are brought about for this purpose, that we may
be proved.</p>
<p>10. Neither must we fear the injuries and penalties of persecutions, because greater is
the Lord to protect than the devil to assault.</p>
<p>11. And lest any one should be frightened and troubled at the afflictions and persecutions
which we suffer in this world, we must prove that it was before foretold that the world would
hold us in hatred, and that it would arouse persecutions against us; that from this very thing,
that these things come to pass, is manifest the truth of the divine promise, in recompenses
and rewards which shall afterwards follow; that it is no new thing which happens to Christians,
since from the beginning of the world the good have suffered, and have been oppressed
and slain by the unrighteous.</p>
<note type="footnote">3701 The Oxford edition here adds, “in the place of gods.”</note>

<pb n="1138"/>
<p>12. In the last place, it must be laid down what hope and what reward await the righteous
and martyrs after the struggles and the sufferings of this time, and that we shall receive more
in the reward of our suffering than what we suffer here in the passion itself.</p>

<head>On the Exhortation to Martyrdom.</head>
<p>1. That idols are not gods, and that the elements are not to be worshipped in the place of
gods.3702</p>
<p>In the cxiiith Psalm it is shown that “the idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the
work of men’s hands. They have a mouth, and speak not; eyes have they, and see not. They
have ears, and hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouth. Let those that make them
be made like unto them.”3703 Also in the Wisdom of Solomon: “They counted all the idols
of the nations to be gods, which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath,
nor ears to hear, nor fingers on their hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to
go. For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them; but no man
can make a god like unto himself. For, since he is mortal, he worketh a dead thing with
wicked hands; for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth, since he indeed
lived once, but they never.”3704 In Exodus also: “Thou shalt not make to thee an idol, nor
the likeness of anything.”3705 Moreover, in Solomon, concerning the elements: “Neither by
considering the works did they acknowledge who was the workmaster; but deemed either
fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the sun, or
the moon, to be gods.3706 On account of whose beauty, if they thought this, let them know
how much more beautiful is the Lord than they. Or if they admired their powers and operations,
let them understand by them, that He that made these mighty things is mightier than
they.”3707</p>
<note type="footnote">3702 [The astronomical idols seem to have been the earliest adopted (Job xxxi. 27), and so the soul degraded

<p>2. That God alone must be worshipped.</p>
<p>“As it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
serve.”3708 Also in Exodus: “Thou shalt have none other gods beside me.”3709 Also in Deuteronomy:
“See ye, see ye that I am He, and that there is no God beside me. I will kill, and
will make alive; I will smite, and I will heal; and there is none who can deliver out of mine
hands.”3710 In the Apocalypse, moreover: “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of
heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach over the earth, and over all nations, and
tribes, and tongues, and peoples, saying with a loud voice, Fear God rather, and give glory
to Him: for the hour of His judgment is come; and worship Him that made heaven and
earth, and the sea, and all that therein is.”3711 So also the Lord, in His Gospel, makes mention
of the first and second commandment, saying, “Hear, O Israel, The Lord thy God is one
God;”3712 and, “Thou shalt love thy Lord with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with
all thy strength. This is the first; and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”3713 And once
more: “And this is life eternal, that they may know Thee, the only and true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom Thou hast sent.”3714</p>

<p>3. What is God’s threatening against those who sacrifice to idols?</p>
<p>In Exodus: “He that sacrificeth unto any gods but the Lord only, shall be rooted out.”3715
Also in Deuteronomy: “They sacrificed unto demons, and not to God.”3716 In Isaiah also:
“They worshipped those which their fingers have made; and the mean man was bowed
down, and the great man was humbled: and I will not forgive them.”3717 And again: “To
them hast thou poured out drink-offerings, and to them thou hast offered sacrifices. For

after other gods, to serve them; and worship them not, and provoke me not in the works of
your hands, to destroy you.”3719 In the Apocalypse too: “If any man worship the beast and
his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, he shall also drink of the
wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in the cup of His wrath, and shall be punished
with fire and brimstone before the eyes of the holy angels, and before the eyes of the Lamb:

day or night, whosoever worship the beast and his image.”3720</p>

<p>4. That God does not easily pardon idolaters.</p>
<p>Moses in Exodus prays for the people, and does not obtain his prayer, saying: “I pray,
O Lord, this people hath sinned a great sin. They have made them gods of gold. And now,
if Thou forgivest them their sin, forgive it; but if not, blot me out of the book which Thou
hast written. And the Lord said unto Moses, If any one hath sinned against me, him will I
blot out of my book.”3721 Moreover, when Jeremiah besought for the people, the Lord
speaks to him, saying: “And pray not thou for this people, and entreat not for them in
prayer and supplication; because I will not hear in the time wherein they shall call upon me
in the time of their affliction.”3722 Ezekiel also denounces this same anger of God upon
those who sin against God, and says: “And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son
of man, whatsoever land sinneth against me, by committing an offence, I will stretch forth
mine hand upon it, and will crush the support of the bread thereof; and I will send into it
famine, and I will take away from it man and beast. And though these three men were in
the midst of it, Noah, Daniel, and Job, they shall not deliver sons nor daughters; they
themselves only shall be delivered.”3723 Likewise in the first book of Kings: “If a man sin by
offending against another, they shall beseech the Lord for him; but if a man sin against God,
who shall entreat for him?”3724</p>

<p>5. That God is so angry against idolatry, that He has even enjoined those to be slain who
persuade others to sacrifice and serve idols.</p>
<p>In Deuteronomy: “But if thy brother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or thy wife which is
in thy bosom, or thy friend which is the fellow of thine own soul, should ask thee secretly,
saying, Let us go and serve other gods, the gods of the nations, thou shalt not consent unto
him, and thou shalt not hearken unto him, neither shall thine eye spare him, neither shalt
thou conceal him, declaring thou shalt declare concerning him. Thine hand shall be upon
him first of all to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people; and they shall
stone him, and he shall die, because he hath sought to turn thee away from the Lord thy
God.”3725 And again the Lord speaks, and says, that neither must a city be spared, even
though the whole city should consent to idolatry: “Or if thou shalt hear in one of the cities
which the Lord thy God shall give thee, to dwell there, saying, Let us go and serve other
gods, which thou hast not known,3726 slaying thou shalt kill all who are in the city with the
slaughter of the sword, and burn the city with fire, and it shall be without habitation for
ever. Moreover, it shall no more be rebuilt, that the Lord may be turned from the indignation
of His anger. And He will show thee mercy, and He will pity thee, and will multiply thee, if
thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt observe His precepts.”3727 Remembering
which precept and its force, Mattathias slew him who had approached the altar to
sacrifice. But if before the coming of Christ these precepts concerning the worship of God
and the despising of idols were observed, how much more should they be regarded since
Christ’s advent; since He, when He came, not only exhorted us with words, but with deeds
also, but after all wrongs and contumelies, suffered also, and was crucified, that He might
teach us to suffer and to die by His example, that there might be no excuse for a man not
to suffer for Him,3728 since He suffered for us; and that since He suffered for the sins of
others, much rather ought each to suffer for his own sins. And therefore in the Gospel He
threatens, and says: “Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before
my Father which is in heaven; but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
before my Father which is in heaven.”3729 The Apostle Paul also says: “For if we die with
Him, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him,
He also will deny us.”3730 John too: “Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the

the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him which is able to kill soul and
body in Gehenna.”3732 And again: “He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he who hateth

<p>6. That, being redeemed and quickened by the blood of Christ, we ought to prefer nothing
to Christ.3734</p>

me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy
of me; and he that taketh not his cross and followeth me, is not worthy of me.”3735 So also
it is written in Deuteronomy: “They who say to their father and their mother, I have not
known thee, and have not acknowledged their own children, these have kept Thy precepts,
and have observed Thy covenant.”3736 Moreover, the Apostle Paul says: “Who shall separate
us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness,
or peril, or sword? As it is written, Because for Thy sake we are killed all the day long,
we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we overcome on account
of Him who hath loved us.”3737 And again: “Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a
great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.”3738 And again: “Christ died for all, that
both they which live may not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died
for them, and rose again.”3739</p>

<p>7. That those who are snatched from the jaws of the devil, and delivered from the snares of
this world,3740 ought not again to return to the world, lest they should lose the advantage
of their withdrawal therefrom.</p>
<p>In Exodus the Jewish people, prefigured as a shadow and image of us, when, with God
for their guardian and avenger, they had escaped the most severe slavery of Pharaoh and of
Egypt—that is, of the devil and the world—faithless and ungrateful in respect of God,
murmur against Moses, looking back to the discomforts of the desert and of their labour;
and, not understanding the divine benefits of liberty and salvation, they seek to return to
the slavery of Egypt—that is, of the world whence they had been drawn forth—when they
ought rather to have trusted and believed on God, since He who delivers His people from
the devil and the world, protects them also when delivered. “Wherefore hast thou thus done
with us,” say they, “in casting us forth out of Egypt? It is better for us to serve the Egyptians
than to die in this wilderness. And Moses said unto the people, Trust, and stand fast, and
see the salvation which is from the Lord, which He shall do to you to-day. The Lord Himself
shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.”3741 The Lord, admonishing us of this in
His Gospel, and teaching that we should not return again to the devil and to the world,
which we have renounced, and whence we have escaped, says: “No man looking back, and
putting his hand to the plough, is fit for the kingdom of God.”3742 And again: “And let him
that is in the field not return back. Remember Lot’s wife.”3743 And lest any one should be
retarded by any covetousness of wealth or attraction of his own people from following Christ,
He adds, and says: “He that forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my disciple.”3744</p>

<p>8. That we must press on and persevere in faith and virtue, and in completion of heavenly
and spiritual grace, that we may attain to the palm and the crown.</p>
<p>In the book of Chronicles: “The Lord is with you so long as ye also are with Him; but
if ye forsake Him, He will forsake you.”3745 In Ezekiel also: “The righteousness of the
righteous shall not deliver him in what day soever he may transgress.”3746 Moreover, in the
Gospel the Lord speaks, and says: “He that shall endure to the end, the same shall be
saved.”3747 And again: “If ye shall abide in my word, ye shall be my disciples indeed; and
ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”3748 Moreover, forewarning us
that we ought always to be ready, and to stand firmly equipped and armed, He adds, and
says: “Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning, and ye yourselves like unto
men that wait for their lord when he shall return from the wedding, that when he cometh
and knocketh they may open unto him. Blessed are those servants whom their lord, when
he cometh, shall find watching.”3749 Also the blessed Apostle Paul, that our faith may advance
and grow, and attain to the highest point, exhorts us, saying: “Know ye not, that they
which run in a race run all indeed, yet one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.3750
And they, indeed, that they may receive a corruptible crown; but ye an incorruptible.”3751
And again: “No man that warreth for God binds himself to anxieties of this world, that he
may be able to please Him to whom he hath approved himself. Moreover, also, if a man
should contend, he will not be crowned unless he have fought lawfully.”3752 And again:
“Now I beseech you, brethren, by the mercy of God, that ye constitute your bodies a living
sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God; and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed
in the renewing of your spirit, that ye may prove what is the will of God, good, and
acceptable, and perfect.”3753 And again: “We are children of God: but if children, then heirs;
heirs indeed of God, but joint-heirs with Christ, if we suffer together, that we may also be
glorified together.”3754 And in the Apocalypse the same exhortation of divine preaching
speaks, saying, “Hold fast that which thou hast, lest another take thy crown;”3755 which ex-

ample of perseverance and persistence is pointed out in Exodus, when Moses, for the overthrow
of Amalek, who bore the type of the devil, raised up his open hands in the sign and
sacrament of the cross,3756 and could not conquer his adversary unless when he had stedfastly
persevered in the sign with hands continually lifted up. “And it came to pass,” says he, “when
Moses raised up his hands, Israel prevailed; but when he let down his hands, Amalek grew
mighty. And they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sate thereon. And Aaron
and Hur held up his hands on the one side and on the other side, and Moses’ hands were
made steady even to the going down of the sun. And Jesus routed Amalek and all his people.
And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this, and let it be a memorial in a book, and tell it in
the ears of Jesus; because in destroying I will destroy the remembrance of Amalek from
under heaven.”3757</p>

And again, Solomon: “The furnace proveth the potter’s vessel, and righteous men the trial
of tribulation.”3759 Paul also testifies similar things, and speaks, saying: “We glory in the
hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that
tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope
maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
Spirit who is given unto us.”3760 And Peter, in his epistle, lays it down, and says: “Beloved,
be not surprised at the fiery heat which falleth upon you, which happens for your trial; and
fail not, as if some new thing were happening unto you. But as often as ye communicate
with the sufferings of Christ, rejoice in all things, that also in the revelation made of His
glory you may rejoice with gladness. If ye be reproached in the name of Christ, happy are
ye; because the name of the majesty and power of the Lord resteth upon you; which indeed
according to them is blasphemed, but according to us is honoured.”3761</p>

<p>10. That injuries and penalties of persecutions are not to be feared by us, because greater is
the Lord to protect than the devil to assault.</p>
<p>John, in his epistle, proves this, saying: “Greater is He who is in you than he that is in
the world.”3762 Also in the cxviith Psalm: “I will not fear what man can do unto me; the
Lord is my helper.”3763 And again: “These in chariots, and those in horses; but we will glory
in the name of the Lord our God. They themselves are bound,3764 and they have fallen; but
we have risen up, and stand upright.”3765 And even more strongly the Holy Spirit, teaching
and showing that the army of the devil is not to be feared, and that, if the foe should declare
war against us, our hope consists rather in that war itself; and that by that conflict the
righteous attain to the reward of the divine abode and eternal salvation,—lays down in the
twenty-sixth Psalm, and says: “Though an host should be arrayed against me, my heart
shall not fear; though war should rise up against me, in that will I put my hope. One hope
have I sought of the Lord, this will I require; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
the days of my life.”3766 Also in Exodus, the Holy Scripture declares that we are rather
multiplied and increased by afflictions, saying: “And the more they afflicted them, so much
the more they became greater, and waxed stronger.”3767 And in the Apocalypse, divine
protection is promised to our sufferings. “Fear nothing of these things,” it says, “which thou
shalt suffer.”3768 Nor does any one else promise to us security and protection, than He who
also speaks by Isaiah the prophet, saying: “Fear not; for I have redeemed thee, and called
thee by thy name: thou art mine. And if thou passest through the water, I am with thee, and
the rivers shall not overflow thee. And if thou passest through the fire, thou shalt not be
burned, and3769 the flame shall not burn thee; for I, the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel,
am He who maketh thee safe.”3770 Who also promises in the Gospel that divine help shall
not be wanting to God’s servants in persecutions, saying: “But when they shall deliver you
up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak. For it shall be given you in that hour what
ye shall speak. For it is not ye who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaketh in
you.”3771 And again: “Settle it in your hearts not to meditate before how to answer. For I

will give you a mouth and wisdom, which your adversaries shall not be able to resist.”3772
As in Exodus God speaks to Moses when he delayed and trembled to go to the people, saying:
“Who hath given a mouth to man? and who hath made the stammerer? and who the deaf
man? and who the seeing, and the blind man? Have not I, the Lord God? And now go, and
I will open thy mouth, and will instruct thee what thou shalt say.”3773 Nor is it difficult for
God to open the mouth of a man devoted to Himself, and to inspire constancy and confidence
in speech to His confessor; since in the book of Numbers He made even a she-ass to speak
against the prophet Balaam.3774 Wherefore in persecutions let no one think what danger
the devil is bringing in, but let him indeed consider what help God affords; nor let human
mischief overpower the mind, but let divine protection strengthen the faith; since every one,
according to the Lord’s promises and the deservings of his faith, receives so much from
God’s help as he thinks that he receives. Nor is there anything which the Almighty is not
able to grant, unless the failing faith of the receiver be deficient and give way.</p>

<p>11. That it was before predicted that the world would hold us in abhorrence, and that it
would stir up persecutions against us, and that no new thing is happening to the
Christians, since from the beginning of the world the good have suffered, and the
righteous have been oppressed and slain by the unrighteous.</p>
<p>The Lord in the Gospel forewarns and foretells, saying: “If the world hates you, know
that it first hated me. If ye were of the world, the world would love what is its own: but because
ye are not of the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world
hateth you. Remember the word that I spoke unto you, The servant is not greater than his
master. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also.”3775 And again: “The hour
will come, that every one that killeth you will think that he doeth God service; but they will
do this because they have not known the Father nor me. But these things have I told you,
that when the hour shall come ye may remember them, because I told you.”3776 And again:
“Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice;
ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.”3777 And again: “These things
have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace; but in the world ye shall have tribulation:
but be of good confidence, for I have overcome the world.”3778 And when He was
interrogated by His disciples concerning the sign of His coming, and of the consummation
of the world, He answered and said: “Take care lest any deceive you: for many shall come
in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. And ye shall begin to hear of wars,
and rumours of wars; see that ye be not troubled: for these things must needs come to pass,
but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
and there shall be famines, and earthquakes, and pestilences, in every place. But all these
things are the beginnings of travailings. Then they shall deliver you up into affliction, and
shall kill you: and ye shall be hateful to all nations for my name’s sake. And then shall many
be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false
prophets shall arise, and shall seduce many; and because wickedness shall abound, the love
of many shall wax cold. But he who shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved. And
this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached through all the world, for a testimony to all
nations; and then shall come the end. When, therefore, ye shall see the abomination of
desolation which is spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him

him which is on the house-roof not go down to take anything from the house; and let him
who is in the field not return back to carry away his clothes. But woe to them that are pregnant,
and to those that are giving suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in
the winter, nor on the Sabbath-day: for there shall be great tribulation, such as has not
arisen from the beginning of the world until now, neither shall arise. And unless those days
should be shortened, no flesh should be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days shall be
shortened. Then if any one shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or, Lo, there; believe him
not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and
wonders, to cause error, if it be possible, even to the elect. But take ye heed: behold, I have
foretold you all things. If, therefore, they shall say to you, Lo, he is in the desert; go not forth:
lo, he is in the sleeping chambers; believe it not. For as the flashing of lightning goeth forth
from the east, and appeareth even to the west, so also shall the coming of the Son of man
be. Wheresoever the carcase shall be, there shall the eagles be gathered together. But immediately
after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not
give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be moved:
and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and all the tribes of the earth
shall lament, and shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power
and glory. And He shall send His angels with a great trumpet, and they shall gather together
His elect from the four winds, from the heights of heaven, even into the farthest bounds
thereof.”3779 And these are not new or sudden things which are now happening to Christians;
since the good and righteous, and those who are devoted to God in the law of innocence
and the fear of true religion, advance always through afflictions, and wrongs, and the severe
and manifold penalties of troubles, in the hardship of a narrow path. Thus, at the very beginning
of the world, the righteous Abel was the first to be slain by his brother; and Jacob
was driven into exile, and Joseph was sold, and king Saul persecuted the merciful David;
and king Ahab endeavoured to oppress Elias, who firmly and bravely asserted the majesty
of God. Zacharias the priest was slain between the temple and the altar, that himself might
there become a sacrifice where he was accustomed to offer sacrifices to God. So many martyrdoms
of the righteous have, in fact, often been celebrated; so many examples of faith and
virtue have been set forth to future generations. The three youths, Ananias, Azarias, and
Misäel, equal in age, agreeing in love, stedfast in faith, constant in virtue, stronger than the
flames and penalties that urged them, proclaim that they only obey God, that they know
Him alone, that they worship Him alone, saying: “O king Nebuchodonosor, there is no need
for us to answer thee in this matter. For the God whom we serve is able to deliver us out of
the furnace of burning fire; and He will deliver us from thy hands, O king. And if not, be it
known unto thee, that we do not serve thy gods, and we do not adore the golden image

which thou hast set up.”3780 And Daniel, devoted to God, and filled with the Holy Spirit,
exclaims and says: “I worship nothing but the Lord my God, who founded the heaven and
the earth.”3781 Tobias also, although under a royal and tyrannical slavery, yet in feeling and
spirit free, maintains his confession to God, and sublimely announces both the divine power
and majesty, saying: “In the land of my captivity I confess to Him, and I show forth His
power in a sinful nation.”3782 What, indeed, do we find in the Maccabees of seven brethren,
equals alike in their lot of birth and virtues, filling up the number seven in the sacrament
of a perfected completion? Seven brethren were thus associating in martyrdom. As the first
seven days in the divine arrangement containing seven thousand of years,3783 as the seven
spirits and seven angels which stand and go in and out before the face of God, and the sevenbranched
lamp in the tabernacle of witness, and the seven golden candlesticks in the Apocalypse,
and the seven columns in Solomon upon which Wisdom built her house; so here
also the number seven of the brethren, embracing, in the quantity of their number, the
seven churches, as likewise in the first book of Kings we read that the barren hath borne
seven. And in Isaiah seven women lay hold on one man, whose name they ask to be called
upon them. And the Apostle Paul, who refers to this lawful and certain number, writes to
the seven churches. And in the Apocalypse the Lord directs His divine and heavenly precepts
to the seven churches and their angels, which number is now found in this case, in the seven
brethren, that a lawful consummation may be completed. With the seven children is manifestly
associated also the mother, their origin and root, who subsequently begat seven
churches, she herself having been first, and alone founded upon a rock3784 by the voice of
the Lord.3785 Nor is it of no account that in their sufferings the mother alone is with her
children. For martyrs who witness themselves as the sons of God in suffering are now no
more counted as of any father but God, as in the Gospel the Lord teaches, saying, “Call no
man your father upon earth; for one is your Father, which is in heaven.”3786</p>
<p>But what utterances of confessions did they herald forth! how illustrious, how great
proofs of faith did they afford! The king Antiochus, their enemy—yea, in Antiochus Antichrist
was set forth—sought to pollute the mouths of martyrs, glorious and unconquered
in the spirit of confession, with the contagion of swine’s flesh; and when he had severely

beaten them with whips, and could prevail nothing, commanded iron plates to be heated,
which being heated and made to glow, he commanded him who had first spoken, and had
more provoked the king with the constancy of his virtue and faith, to be brought up and
roasted, his tongue having first been pulled out and cut off, which had confessed God; and
this happened the more gloriously to the martyr. For the tongue which had confessed the
name of God, ought itself first to go to God. Then in the second, sharper pains having been
devised, before he tortured the other limbs, he tore off the skin of his head with the hair,
doubtless with a purpose in his hatred. For since Christ is the head of the man, and God is
the head of Christ, he who tore the head in the martyr was persecuting God and Christ in
that head. But he, trusting in his martyrdom, and promising to himself from the retribution
of God the reward of resurrection, exclaimed and said, “Thou indeed impotently destroyest
us out of this present life; but the King of the world will raise us up, who die for His laws,
unto the eternal resurrection of life.”3787 The third being challenged, quickly put forth his
tongue; for he had learned from his brother to despise the punishment of cutting off the
tongue. Moreover, he firmly held forth his hands to be cut off, greatly happy in such a mode
of punishment, since it was his lot to imitate, by stretching forth his hands, the form of his
Lord’s passion. And also the fourth, with like virtue, despising the tortures, and answering,
to restrain the king, with a heavenly voice exclaimed, and said, “It is better that those who
are given to death by men should wait for hope from God, to be raised up by Him again to
eternal life.3788 For to thee there shall be no resurrection to life.”3789 The fifth, besides
treading under foot the torments of the king, and his severe and various tortures, by the
strength of faith, animated to prescience also and knowledge of future events by the Spirit
of divinity, foretold to the king the wrath of God, and the vengeance that should swiftly
follow. “Having power,” said he, “among men, though thou art corruptible, thou doest what
thou wilt. But think not that our race is forsaken of God. Abide, and see His great power,
how He will torment thee and thy seed.”3790 What alleviation was that to the martyr!3791
how substantial a comfort in his sufferings, not to consider his own torments, but to predict
the penalties of his tormentor! But in the sixth, not his bravery only, but also his humility,
is to be set forth; that the martyr claimed nothing to himself, nor even made an account of
the honour of his own confession with proud words, but rather ascribed it to his sins that
he was suffering persecution from the king, while he attributed to God that afterwards he
should be avenged. He taught that martyrs are modest, that they were confident of vengeance,

and boasted nothing in their suffering. “Do not,” said he, “needlessly err; for we on our own
account suffer these things, as sinning against our God. But think not thou that thou shalt
be unpunished, who darest to fight against God.”3792 Also the admirable mother, who,
neither broken down by the weakness of her sex, nor moved by her manifold bereavement,
looked upon her dying children with cheerfulness, and did not reckon those things punishments
of her darlings, but glories, giving as great a witness to God by the virtue of her eyes,
as her children had given by the tortures and suffering of their limbs; when, after the punishment
and slaying of six, there remained one of the brethren, to whom the king promised
riches, and power, and many things, that his cruelty and ferocity might be soothed by the
satisfaction of even one being subdued, and asked that the mother would entreat that her
son might be cast down with herself; she entreated, but it was as became a mother of martyrs—
as became one who was mindful of the law and of God—as became one who loved
her sons not delicately, but bravely. For she entreated, but it was that he would confess God.
She entreated that the brother would not be separated from his brothers in the alliance of
praise and glory; then only considering herself the mother of seven sons, if it should happen
to her to have brought forth seven sons, not to the world, but to God. Therefore arming
him, and strengthening him, and so bearing her son by a more blessed birth, she said, “O
son, pity me that bare thee ten3793 months in the womb, and gave thee milk for three years,
and nourished thee and brought thee up to this age; I pray thee, O son, look upon the
heaven and the earth; and having considered all the things which are in them, understand
that out of nothing God made these things and the human race. Therefore, O son,3794 do
not fear that executioner; but being made worthy of thy brethren, receive death, that in the
same mercy I may receive thee with thy brethren.”3795 The mother’s praise was great in her
exhortation to virtue, but greater in the fear of God and in the truth of faith, that she
promised nothing to herself or her son from the honour of the six martyrs, nor believed
that the prayer of the brothers would avail3796 for the salvation of one who should deny,
but rather persuaded him to become a sharer in their suffering, that in the day of judgment
he might be found with his brethren. After this the mother also dies with her children; for
neither was anything else becoming, than that she who had borne and made martyrs, should
be joined in the fellowship of glory with them, and that she herself should follow those
whom she had sent before to God. And lest any, when the opportunity either of a certificate
or of any such matter is offered to him whereby he may deceive, should embrace the wicked

part of deceivers, let us not be silent, moreover, about Eleazar, who, when an opportunity
was offered him by the ministers of the king, that having received the flesh which it was allowable
for him to partake of, he might pretend, for the misguiding of the king, that he ate
those things which were forced upon him from the sacrifices and unlawful meats, would
not consent to this deception, saying that it was fitting neither for his age nor nobility to
feign that, whereby others would be scandalized and led into error; if they should think that
Eleazar, being ninety years old, had left and betrayed the law of God, and had gone over to
the manner of aliens; and that it was not of so much consequence to gain the short moments
of life, and so incur eternal punishment from an offended God. And he having been long
tortured, and now at length reduced to extremity, while he was dying in the midst of stripes
and tortures, groaned and said, “O Lord, that hast the holy knowledge, it is manifest that
although I might be delivered from death, I suffer the severest pains of body, being beaten
with scourges; but with my mind, on account of Thy fear, I willingly suffer these things.”3797
Assuredly his faith was sincere and his virtue sound, and abundantly pure, not to have regarded
king Antiochus, but God the Judge, and to have known that it could not avail him
for salvation if he should mock and deceive man, when God, who is the judge of our conscience,
and who only is to be feared, cannot at all be mocked nor deceived. If, therefore,
we also live as dedicated and devoted to God—if we make our way over the ancient and
sacred footsteps of the righteous, let us go through the same proofs of sufferings, the same
testimonies of passions, considering the glory of our time the greater on this account, that
while ancient examples may be numbered, yet that subsequently, when the abundance of
virtue and faith was in excess, the Christian martyrs cannot be numbered, as the Apocalypse
testifies and says: “After these things I beheld a great multitude, which no man could number,
of every nation, and of every tribe, and people, and language, standing in the sight of the
throne and of the Lamb; and they were clothed in white robes, and palms were in their
hands; and they said with a loud voice, Salvation to our God, who sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb! And one of the elders answered and said unto me, Who are those which
are arrayed in white robes, and whence come they? And I said unto him, My lord, thou
knowest. And he said unto me, These are they who have come out of great tribulation, and
have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are
they before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple.”3798 But if the
assembly of the Christian martyrs is shown and proved to be so great, let no one think it a
hard or a difficult thing to become a martyr, when he sees that the crowd of martyrs cannot
be numbered.</p>

<p>12. What hope and reward remains for the righteous and for martyrs after the conflicts and
sufferings of this present time,</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit shows and predicts by Solomon, saying: “And although in the sight of
men they suffered torments, yet their hope is full of immortality. And having been troubled
in a few things, they shall be in many happily ordered, because God has tried them, and has
found them worthy of Himself. As gold in the furnace, He hath tried them; and as whole
burnt-offerings of sacrifice, He hath received them, and in its season there will be respect
of them. They will shine and run about as sparks in a place set with reeds.3799 They shall
judge the nations, and have dominion over the peoples; and their Lord shall reign for
ever.”3800 In the same also our vengeance is described, and the repentance of those who
persecute and molest us is announced. “Then,” saith he, “shall the righteous stand in great
constancy before such as have afflicted them, and who have taken away their labours; when
they see it, they shall be troubled with a horrible fear: and they shall marvel at the suddenness
of their unexpected salvation, saying among themselves, repenting and groaning for anguish
of spirit, These are they whom we had sometime in derision and as a proverb of reproach.
We fools counted their life madness, and their end to be without honour. How are they
numbered among the children of God, and their lot is among the saints! Therefore have we
erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the
sun hath not risen upon us. We have been wearied in the way of unrighteousness and perdition,
and have walked through hard deserts, but have not known the way of the Lord.
What hath pride profited us, or what hath the boasting of riches brought to us? All these
things have passed away like a shadow.” Likewise in the cxvth Psalm is shown the price and
the reward of suffering: “Precious,” it says, “in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
saints.”3801 In the cxxvth Psalm also is expressed the sadness of the struggle, and the joy of
the retribution: “They who sow,” it says, “in tears, shall reap in joy. As they walked, they
walked and wept, casting their seeds; but as they come again, they shall come in exultation,
bearing their sheaves.”3802 And again, in the cxviiith Psalm: “Blessed are those that are undefiled
in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they who search His testimonies,
and seek Him out with their whole heart.”3803 Moreover, the Lord in the Gospel,
Himself the avenger of our persecution and the rewarder of our suffering, says: “Blessed
are they who suffer persecution for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heav-

en.”3804 And again: “Blessed shall ye be when men shall hate you, and shall separate you,
and shall expel you, and shall revile your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake. Rejoice ye
in that day, and leap for joy; for, behold, your reward is great in heaven.”3805 And once
more: “Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.”3806 Nor do the
rewards of the divine promise attend those alone who are reproached and slain; but if the
passion itself be wanting to the faithful, while their faith has remained sound and unconquered,
and having forsaken and contemned all his possessions, the Christian has shown
that he is following Christ, even he also is honoured by Christ among the martyrs, as He
Himself promises and says: “There is no man that leaveth house, or land, or parents, or
brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake, but shall receive seven times
as much in this present time, and in the world to come eternal life.”3807 In the Apocalypse
also He says the same thing: “And I saw,” saith he, “the souls of them that were slain for the
name of Jesus and the word of God.” And when he had placed those who were slain in the
first place, he added, saying: “And whosoever had not worshipped the image of the beast,
neither had received his mark upon their forehead or in their hand;” all these he joins together,
as seen by him at one time in the same place, and says, “And they lived and reigned
with Christ.”3808 He says that all live and reign with Christ, not only who have been slain;
but even whosoever, standing in firmness of the faith and in the fear of God, have not worshipped
the image of the beast, and have not consented to his deadly and sacrilegious edicts.</p>

<p>13. That we receive more as the reward of our suffering than what we endure here in the
suffering itself,</p>
<p>The blessed Apostle Paul proves; who by the divine condescension, being caught up
into the third heaven and into paradise, testifies that he heard unspeakable words, who
boasts that he saw Jesus Christ by the faith of sight, who professes that which he both learnt
and saw with the greater truth of consciousness, and says: “The sufferings of this present
time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory which shall be revealed in us.”3809
Who, then, does not with all his powers labour to attain to such a glory that he may become
the friend of God, that he may at once rejoice with Christ, that after earthly tortures and
punishments he may receive divine rewards? If to soldiers of this world it is glorious to return
in triumph to their country when the foe is vanquished, how much more excellent and
greater is the glory, when the devil is overcome, to return in triumph to paradise, and to
bring back victorious trophies to that place whence Adam was ejected as a sinner, after
casting down him who formerly had cast him down; to offer to God the most acceptable
gift—an uncorrupted faith, and an unyielding virtue of mind, an illustrious praise of devotion;
to accompany Him when He shall come to receive vengeance from His enemies, to stand
at His side when He shall sit to judge, to become co-heir of Christ, to be made equal to the
angels; with the patriarchs, with the apostles, with the prophets, to rejoice in the possession
of the heavenly kingdom! Such thoughts as these, what persecution can conquer, what tortures
can overcome? The brave and stedfast mind, founded in religious meditations, endures;
and the spirit abides unmoved against all the terrors of the devil and the threats of the world,
when it is strengthened by the sure and solid faith of things to come. In persecutions, earth
is shut up,3810 but heaven is opened; Antichrist is threatening, but Christ is protecting; death
is brought in, but immortality follows; the world is taken away from him that is slain, but
paradise is set forth to him restored; the life of time is extinguished, but the life of eternity
is realized. What a dignity it is, and what a security, to go gladly from hence, to depart
gloriously in the midst of afflictions and tribulations; in a moment to close the eyes with
which men and the world are looked upon, and at once to open them to look upon God
and Christ! Of such a blessed departure how great is the swiftness! You shall be suddenly
taken away from earth, to be placed in the heavenly kingdoms. It behoves us to embrace
these things in our mind and consideration, to meditate on these things day and night. If
persecution should fall upon such a soldier of God, his virtue, prompt for battle, will not be
able to be overcome. Or if his call should come to him before, his faith shall not be without
reward, seeing it was prepared for martyrdom; without loss of time, the reward is rendered

<p>Three Books of Testimonies Against the Jews.</p>
<p>Cyprian to his son Quirinus, greeting. It was necessary, my beloved son, that I should
obey your spiritual desire, which asked with most urgent petition for those divine teachings
wherewith the Lord has condescended to teach and instruct us by the Holy Scriptures, that,
being led away from the darkness of error, and enlightened by His pure and shining light,
we may keep the way of life through the saving sacraments. And indeed, as you have asked,
so has this discourse been arranged by me; and this treatise has been ordered in an abridged
compendium, so that I should not scatter what was written in too diffuse an abundance,
but, as far as my poor memory suggested, might collect all that was necessary in selected
and connected heads, under which I may seem, not so much to have treated the subject, as
to have afforded material for others to treat it. Moreover, to readers also, brevity of the same
kind is of very great advantage, in that a treatise of too great length dissipates the understanding
and perception of the reader, while a tenacious memory keeps that which is read in a
more exact compendium. But I have comprised in my undertaking two books of equally
moderate length: one wherein I have endeavoured to show that the Jews, according to what
had before been foretold, had departed from God, and had lost God’s favour, which had
been given them in past time, and had been promised them for the future; while the Christians
had succeeded to their place, deserving well of the Lord by faith, and coming out of
all nations and from the whole world. The second book likewise contains the sacrament of
Christ, that He has come who was announced according to the Scriptures, and has done
and perfected all those things whereby He was foretold as being able to be perceived and
known.3813 And these things may be of advantage to you meanwhile, as you read, for
forming the first lineaments of your faith. More strength will be given you, and the intelligence
of the heart will be effected more and more, as you examine more fully the Scriptures,
old and new, and read through the complete volumes of the spiritual books.3814 For now
we have filled a small measure from the divine fountains, which in the meantime we would
send to you. You will be able to drink more plentifully, and to be more abundantly satisfied,
if you also will approach to drink together with us at the same springs of the divine fulness.
3815 I bid you, beloved son, always heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Testimonies.</head>
<p>1. That the Jews have fallen under the heavy wrath of God because they have forsaken the
Lord, and have followed idols.</p>
<p>In Exodus the people said to Aaron: “Arise and make us gods which shall go before us:
because as for this man Moses, who brought us out of Egypt, we know not what has become
of him.”3817 In the same place also Moses says to the Lord: “O Lord, I pray thee, this people
have sinned a great sin. They have made to themselves gods of gold and silver. And now, if
thou wilt forgive them their sin, forgive; but if not, blot me out of the book which Thou hast
written. And the Lord said unto Moses, If any one hath sinned against me, him will I blot
out of my book.”3818 Likewise in Deuteronomy: They sacrificed unto demons, and not
unto God.”3819 In the book of Judges too: “And the children of Israel did evil in the sight
of the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed
the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and offended the Lord, and forsook
God, and served Baal.”3820 Also in the same place: “And the children of Israel added again
to do evil3821 in the sight of the Lord, and served Baal and the gods of the strangers, and
forsook the Lord, and served Him not.”3822 In Malachi: “Judah is forsaken, and has become
an abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem, because Judah has profaned the holiness of the
Lord in those things wherein He hath loved, and courted strange gods. The Lord will cut
off the man who doeth this, and he shall be made base in the tabernacles of Jacob.”3823</p>

<p>2. Also because they did not believe the prophets, and put them to death.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah the Lord says: “I have sent unto I you my servants the prophets. Before the
daylight I sent them (and ye heard me not, and did not listen with your ears), saying, Let
every one of you be converted from his evil way, and from your most wicked desires; and
ye shall dwell in that land which I have given you and your fathers for ever and ever.”3824
And again:3825 “Go not after other gods, to serve them, and do not worship them; and
provoke me not to anger in the works of your hands to scatter you abroad; and ye have not
hearkened unto me.”3826 Also in the third book of the Kings, Elias saith unto the Lord: “In
being jealous I have been jealous for the Lord God Almighty; because the children of Israel
have forsaken Thee, have demolished Thine altars, and have slain Thy prophets with the
sword; and I have remained solitary, and they seek my life, to take it away from me.”3827 In
Ezra also: “They have fallen away from Thee, and have cast Thy law behind their backs, and
have killed Thy prophets which testified against them that they should return to Thee.”3828</p>

<p>3. That it was previously foretold that they would neither know the Lord, nor understand,
nor receive Him.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken; I have begotten
and brought up children, but they have rejected me. The ox knoweth his owner, and
the ass his master’s crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not perceived
me. Ah sinful nation, a people filled with sins, a wicked seed, corrupting children: ye have
forsaken the Lord, and have sent that Holy One of Israel into anger.”3829 In the same also
the Lord says: “Go and tell this people, Ye shall hear with the ear, and shall not understand;
and seeing, ye shall see, and shall not perceive. For the heart of this people hath waxed gross,
and they hardly hear with their ears, and they have shut up their eyes, lest haply they should
see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should
return, and I should heal them.”3830 Also in Jeremiah the Lord says: “They have forsaken
me, the fountain of living water, and have dug for themselves worn-out cisterns, which
could not hold water.”3831 Moreover, in the same: “Behold, the word of the Lord has become
unto them a reproach, and they do not wish for it.”3832 Again in the same the Lord says:
“The kite knoweth his time, the turtle, and the swallow;3833 the sparrows of the field keep
the time of their coming in; but my people doth not know the judgment of the Lord. How
say ye, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? The false measurement3834 has been
made vain; the scribes are confounded; the wise men have trembled, and been taken, because
they have rejected the word of the Lord.”3835 In Solomon also: “Evil men seek me, and shall
not find me; for they held wisdom in hatred and did not receive the word of the Lord.”3836
Also in the twenty-seventh Psalm: “Render to them their deserving, because they have not
perceived in the works of the Lord.”3837 Also in the eighty-first Psalm: “They have not
known, neither have they understood; they shall walk on in darkness.”3838 In the Gospel,

<p>4. That the Jews would not understand the Holy Scriptures, but that they would be intelligible
in the last times, after that Christ had come.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “And all these words shall be unto you as the words of a book that is sealed,
which, if you shall give to a man that knoweth letters to read, he shall say, I cannot read, for
it is sealed. But in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and they who are in
darkness and in a cloud; the eyes of the blind shall see.”3840 Also in Jeremiah: “In the last
of the days ye shall know those things.”3841 In Daniel, moreover: “Secure the words, and
seal the book until the time of consummation, until many learn, and knowledge is fulfilled,
because when there shall be a dispersion they shall know all these things.”3842 Likewise in
the first Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians: “Brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
that all our fathers were under the cloud.”3843 Also in the second Epistle to the Corinthians:
“Their minds are blinded even unto this day, by this same veil which is taken away in Christ,
while this same veil remains in the reading of the Old Testament, which is not unveiled,
because it is made void in Christ; and even to this day, if at any time Moses is read, the veil
is upon their heart. But by and by, when they shall be turned unto the Lord, the veil shall
be taken away.”3844 In the Gospel, the Lord after His resurrection says: “These are the words
which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which are
written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me. Then
opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures; and said unto
them, That thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the
dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His
name even among all nations.”3845</p>

<p>5. That the Jews could understand nothing of the Scriptures unless they first believed in
Christ.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “And if ye will not believe, neither will ye understand.”3846 Also the Lord in
the Gospel: “For if ye believe not that I am He, ye shall die in your sins.”3847 Moreover, that
righteousness should subsist by faith, and that in it was life, was predicted in Habakkuk:
“Now the just shall live by faith of me.”3848 Hence Abraham, the father of the nations, believed;
in Genesis: “Abraham believed in God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.”
3849 In like manner, Paul to the Galatians: “Abraham believed in God, and it was
counted unto him for righteousness. Ye know, therefore, that they which are of faith, the
same are children of Abraham. But the Scripture, foreseeing that God justifieth the heathens
by faith, foretold to Abraham that all nations should be blessed in him. Therefore they who
are of faith are blessed3850 with faithful Abraham.”3851</p>

shall devour it in your sight; and the daughter of Zion shall be left deserted, and overthrown
by foreign peoples, as a cottage in a vineyard, and as a keeper’s lodge in a garden of cucumbers,
as a city which is besieged. And unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we should
have been as Sodoma, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.”3852 Also in the Gospel
the Lord says: “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are
sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, and thou wouldst not! Behold, your house shall be left unto you desolate.”3853</p>

<p>In Isaiah: “Come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. For He hath sent away His
people, the house of Israel.”3854 In His Gospel also, according to John: “That was the true
light which lighteth every man that cometh into this world. He was in this world, and the
world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.”3855 Moreover, in the same place:
“He that believeth not is judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son of God. And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light.”3856</p>

<p>8. That the first circumcision of the flesh is made void, and the second circumcision of the

<p>In Jeremiah: “Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah, and to them who inhabit Jerusalem,
Renew newness among you, and do not sow among thorns: circumcise yourselves to
your God, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart; lest my anger go forth like fire, and
burn you up, and there be none to extinguish it.”3857 Also Moses says: “In the last days God
will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God.”3858 Also in
Jesus the son of Nave: “And the Lord said unto Jesus, Make thee small knives of stone, very
sharp, and set about to circumcise the children of Israel for the second time.”3859 Paul also,
to the Colossians: “Ye are circumcised with the circumcision not made with hands in the
putting off of the flesh, but with the circumcision of Christ.”3860 Also, because Adam was
first made by God uncircumcised, and righteous Abel, and Enoch, who pleased God and
was translated; and Noah, who, when the world and men were perishing on account of
transgressions, was chosen alone, that in him the human race might be preserved; and
Melchizedek, the priest according to whose order Christ was promised. Then, because that
sign did not avail women,3861 but all are sealed by the sign of the Lord.</p>

I ordered with their fathers in that day in which I took hold of their hands to bring them
out of the land of Egypt, because they remained not in my testament, and I disregarded
them, saith the Lord: Because this is the testament which I will establish with the house of
Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give them my laws, and into their minds I will
write them; and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to me for a people; and they
shall not teach every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from
the least even to the greatest of them: for I will be merciful to their iniquities, and will no

make in the desert a way, and rivers in a dry place, to give drink to my chosen race, my
people whom I acquired, that they should show forth my praises.”3868 In the same also: “If
they thirst, He will lead them through the deserts; He will bring forth water from the rock;
the rock shall be cloven, and the water shall flow: and my people shall drink.”3869 Moreover,
in the Gospel according to Matthew, John says: “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance:
but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.”3870 Also according to John:
“Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

from us.”3872 Likewise in the Gospel according to Matthew, the Lord says: “Come unto
me, all ye that labour and are burdened, and I will cause you to rest. Take my yoke upon
you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
souls. For my yoke is excellent, and my burden is light.”3873 In Jeremiah: “In that day I will

to my own heart, and they shall feed you with the food of discipline.”3876 In Jeremiah,
moreover: “Hear the word of the Lord, ye nations, and tell it to the islands which are afar

Psalm: “I will not eat the flesh of bulls, nor drink the blood of goats. Offer to God the sacrifice
of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High. Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I
will deliver thee: and thou shalt glorify me.”3882 In the same Psalm, moreover: “The sacrifice
of praise shall glorify me: therein is the way in which I will show him the salvation of

<p>20. That the Church which before had been barren should have more children from among
the Gentiles than what the synagogue had had before.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “Rejoice, thou barren, that barest not; and break forth and cry, thou that
travailest not: because many more are the children of the desolate one than of her who hath
an husband. For the Lord hath said, Enlarge the place of thy tabernacle, and of thy curtains,
and fasten them: spare not, make long thy measures, and strengthen thy stakes: stretch forth
yet to thy right hand and to thy left hand; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and shall
inhabit the deserted cities. Fear not; because thou shalt overcome: nor be afraid because
thou art cursed; for thou shalt forget thy eternal confusion.”3892 Thus also to Abraham,
when his former son was born of a bond-woman, Sarah remained long barren; and late in
old age bare her son Isaac, of promise, who was the type of Christ. Thus also Jacob received
two wives: the elder Leah, with weak eyes, a type of the synagogue; the younger the beautiful
Rachel, a type of the Church, who also remained long barren, and afterwards brought forth
Joseph, who also was himself a type of Christ. And in the first of Kings it is said that Elkanah
had two wives: Peninnah, with her sons; and Hannah, barren, from whom is born Samuel,
not according to the order of generation, but according to the mercy and promise of God,
when she had prayed in the temple; and Samuel being born, was a type of Christ. Also in
the first book of Kings: “The barren hath borne seven and she that had many children has
grown weak.”3893 But the seven children are the seven churches. Whence also Paul wrote
to seven churches; and the Apocalypse sets forth seven churches, that the number seven
may be preserved; as the seven days in which God made the world; as the seven angels who
stand and go in and out before the face of God, as Raphael the angel says in Tobit; and the
sevenfold lamp in the tabernacle of witness; and the seven eyes of God, which keep watch
over the world; and the stone with seven eyes, as Zechariah says; and the seven spirits; and
the seven candlesticks in the Apocalypse; and the seven pillars upon which Wisdom hath
builded her house in Solomon.</p>

<p>21. That the Gentiles should rather believe in Christ.</p>
<p>In Genesis: “And the Lord God said unto Abraham, Go out from thy country, and from
thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, and go into that land which I shall show thee: and
I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and I will magnify thy name; and
thou shalt be blessed: and I will bless him that blesseth thee, and I will curse him that curseth
thee: and in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed.”3894 On this same point in Genesis:
“And Isaac blessed Jacob.3895 Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful
field which the Lord hath blessed: and God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fertility
of the earth, abundance of corn, and wine, and oil: and peoples shall obey thee, and princes
shall worship thee: and thou shalt be lord over thy brother, and the sons of thy father shall
worship thee; and he that curseth thee shall be cursed, and he that blesseth thee shall be
blessed.”3896 On this matter too in Genesis: “But when Joseph saw that his father placed his
right hand on the head of Ephraim, it seemed displeasing to him: and Joseph laid hold of
his father’s hand, to lift it from the head of Ephraim on to the head of Manasseh. Moreover,
Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: this is my first-born; place thy right hand
upon his head. But he would not, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: and he also shall
be a people, and he shall be exalted; but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and

shall praise thee: thine hand shall be upon the back of thine enemies; the sons of thy father
shall worship thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the slender twig,3898 my son, thou hast ascended:
thou layedst down and sleepedst as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp. Who shall stir him
up? There shalt not fail a prince from Judah, and a leader from his loins, until those things
entrusted to him shall come; and he is the hope of the nations: binding his foal unto the
vine, and his ass’s colt unto the branch of the vine;3899 he shall wash his garments in wine,
and his clothing in the blood of the grape: terrible are his eyes with wine, and his teeth are
whiter than milk.”3900 Hence in Numbers it is written concerning our people: “Behold,
the people shall rise up as a lion-like people.”3901 In Deuteronomy: “Ye Gentiles shall be

the sound of the trumpet. And they said, We will not hear: for this cause the nations shall
hear, and they who shall feed their cattle among them.”3903 In the seventeenth Psalm: “Thou
shalt establish me the head of the nations: a people whom I have not known have served
me: at the hearing of the ear they have obeyed me.”3904 Concerning this very thing the Lord
says in Jeremiah: “Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou wentest
forth from the womb, I sanctified thee, and established thee as a prophet among the nations.”
3905 Also in Isaiah: “Behold, I have manifested him for a witness to the nations, a
prince and a commander to the peoples.”3906 Also in the same: “Nations which have not
known Thee shall call upon Thee; and peoples which were ignorant of Thee shall flee to
Thee.”3907 In the same, moreover: “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
rise to rule in all the nations; in Him shall the Gentiles hope: and His rest shall be honour.”
3908 In the same again: “The land of Zebulon, and the land of Nephtalim, by the way

nations. People that walk in darkness, behold ye a great light; ye who dwell in the region of
the shadow of death, the light shall shine upon you.”3910 Also in the same: “Thus saith the
Lord God to Christ my Lord, whose right hand I hold, that the nations may hear Him; and
I will break asunder the strength of kings, I will open before Him gates; and cities shall not
be shut.”3911 Also in the same: “I come to gather together all nations and tongues; and they
shall come, and see my glory. And I will send out over them a standard, and I will send those
that are preserved among them to the nations which are afar off, which have not heard my
name nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory to the nations.”3912 Also in the
same: “And in all these things they are not converted; therefore He shall lift up a standard
to the nations which are afar, and He will draw them from the end of the earth.”3913 Also

says: “It was necessary that the word of God should first be shown to you; but since ye put
it from you, and judged yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles: for

<p>22. That the Jews would lose while we should receive the bread and the cup of Christ and
all His grace, and that the new name of Christians should be blessed in the earth.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “Thus saith the Lord, Behold, they who serve me shall eat, but ye shall be
hungry: behold, they who serve me shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty:3917 behold, they who
serve me shall rejoice, but ye shall be confounded; the Lord shall slay you. But to those who
serve me a new name shall be named, which shall be blessed in the earth.”3918 Also in the
same place: “Therefore shall He lift up an ensign to the nations which are afar off, and He
will draw them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come swiftly with lightness;
they shall not hunger nor thirst.”3919 Also in the same place: “Behold, therefore, the Ruler,
the Lord of Sabaoth, shall take away from Judah and from Jerusalem the healthy man and
the strong man, the strength of bread and the strength of water.”3920 Likewise in the thirtythird
Psalm: “O taste and see how sweet is the Lord. Blessed is the man that hopeth in Him.
Fear the Lord God, all ye His saints: for there is no want to them that fear Him. Rich men
have wanted and have hungered; but they who seek the Lord shall never want any good
thing.”3921 Moreover, in the Gospel according to John, the Lord says: “I am the bread of
life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that trusteth in me shall never thirst.”3922
Likewise He saith in that place: “If any one thirst, let him come and drink. He that believeth
on me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”3923 Moreover,
He says in the same place: “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood,
ye shall have no life in you.”3924</p>

<p>23. That the Gentiles rather than the Jews attain to the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>In the Gospel the Lord says: “Many shall come from the east and from the west, and
shall lie down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but the children
of the kingdom shall go out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of

<p>24. That by this alone the Jews can receive pardon of their sins, if they wash away the blood
of Christ slain, in His baptism, and, passing over into His Church, obey His precepts.</p>
<p>In Isaiah the Lord says: “Now I will not release your sins. When ye stretch forth your
hands, I will turn away my face from you; and if ye multiply prayers, I will not hear you: for
your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean; take away the wickedness from
your souls from the sight of mine eyes; cease from your wickedness; learn to do good; seek
judgment; keep him who suffers wrong; judge for the orphan, and justify the widow. And
come, let us reason together, saith the Lord: and although your sins be as scarlet, I will
whiten3926 them as snow; and although they were as crimson, I will whiten3927 them as
wool. And if ye be willing and listen to me, ye shall eat of the good of the land; but if ye be
unwilling, and will not hear me, the sword shall consume you; for the mouth of the Lord
hath spoken these things.”3928</p>

<head>Testimonies.</head>
<p>1. That Christ is the First-born, and that He is the Wisdom of God, by whom all things
were made.</p>
<p>In Solomon in the Proverbs: “The Lord established3929 me in the beginning of His ways,
into His works: before the world He founded me. In the beginning, before He made the
earth, and before He appointed the abysses, before the fountains of waters gushed forth,
before the mountains were settled, before all the hills, the Lord begot me. He made the
countries, and the uninhabitable places, and the uninhabitable bounds under heaven. When
He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him; and when He set apart His seat. When He
made the strong clouds above the winds, and when He placed the strengthened fountains
under heaven, when He made the mighty foundations of the earth, I was by His side, ordering
them: I was He in whom He delighted: moreover, I daily rejoiced before His face in all time,
when He rejoiced in the perfected earth.”3930 Also in the same in Ecclesiasticus: “I went
forth out of the mouth of the Most High, first-born before every creature: I made the unwearying
light to rise in the heavens, and I covered the whole earth with a cloud: I dwelt in
the high places, and my throne in the pillar of the cloud: I compassed the circle of heaven,
and I penetrated into the depth of the abyss, and I walked on the waves of the sea, and I
stood in all the earth; and in every people and in every nation I had the pre-eminence, and
by my own strength I have trodden the hearts of all the excellent and the humble: in me is
all hope of life and virtue: pass over to me, all ye who desire me.”3931 Also in the eightyeighth
Psalm: “And I will establish Him as my first-born, the highest among the kings of
the earth. I will keep my mercy for Him for ever, and my faithful covenant for Him; and I
will establish his seed for ever and ever. If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my
judgments; if they profane my judgments, and do not observe my precepts, I will visit their
wickednesses with a rod, and their sins with scourges; but my mercy will I not scatter away
from them.”3932 Also in the Gospel according to John, the Lord says: “And this is life
eternal, that they should know Thee, the only and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou
hast sent. I have glorified Thee on the earth: I have finished the work which Thou gavest
me to do. And now, do Thou glorify me with Thyself, with the glory which I had with Thee
before the world was made.”3933 Also Paul to the Colossians: “Who is the image of the in-

visible God, and the first-born of every creature.”3934 Also in the same place: “The firstborn
from the dead, that He might in all things become the holder of the pre-eminence.”3935
In the Apocalypse too: “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto
Him that is thirsting from the fountain of the water of life freely.”3936 That He also is both
the wisdom and the power of God, Paul proves in his first Epistle to the Corinthians. “Because
the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: but we preach Christ crucified,
to the Jews indeed a stumbling-block, and to the Gentiles foolishness; but to them that are
called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.”3937</p>

<p>2. That Christ is the Wisdom of God; and concerning the sacrament of His incarnation and
of His passion, and cup and altar; and of the apostles who were sent, and preached.</p>
<p>In Solomon in the Proverbs: “Wisdom hath builded herself an house, and she has placed
under it seven pillars; she has slain her victims; she hath mingled her wine in the goblet,
and hath made ready her table,3938 and hath sent her servants, calling with a loud announcement
to the cup, saying, Let him who is foolish turn to me: and to them that want understanding
she has said, Come, eat of my loaves, and drink the wine which I have mingled for
you. Forsake foolishness, and seek wisdom, and correct knowledge by understanding.”3939</p>
<note type="footnote">3938 [The house = the Church; the seven pillars = Isa. xi. 2, 3; her table = the Lord’s table; her cup = the sacrament

made fast; and all their strength by the breath of His mouth.”3941 Also in Isaiah: “A Word
completing and shortening in righteousness, because a shortened word will God make in
the whole earth.”3942 Also in the cvith Psalm: “He sent His Word, and healed them.”3943
Moreover, in the Gospel according to John: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God. All things
were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made that was made. In Him was life;
and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
it not.”3944 Also in the Apocalypse: “And I saw the heaven opened, and lo, a
white horse; and he who sate upon him was called Faithful and True, judging rightly and
justly; and He made war. And He was covered with a garment sprinkled with blood; and
His name is called the Word of God.”3945</p>

<p>4. That Christ is the Hand and Arm of God.3946</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “Is God’s Hand not strong to save? or has He made His ear heavy, that He
cannot hear? But your sins separate between you and God; and on account of your sins He
turns His face away from you, that He may not pity. For your hands are defiled with blood,
and your fingers with sins. Moreover, your lips have spoken wickedness, and your tongue
meditates unrighteousness. No one speaketh truth, nor is there true judgment: they trust
in vanity, and speak emptiness, who conceive sorrow, and bring forth wickedness.”3947 Also
in the same place: “Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom is the Arm of God
revealed?”3948 Also in the same: “Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is my throne, and the earth
is the support of my feet. What house will ye build unto me? or what is the place for my
rest? For all these things hath mine hand made.”3949 Also in the same: “O Lord God, Thine
Arm is high, and they knew it not; but when they know it, they shall be confounded.”3950
Also in the same: “The Lord hath revealed His Arm, that holy Arm, in the sight of all nations;
all nations, even the ends of the earth, shall see salvation from God.”3951 Also in the same
place: “Behold, I have made thee as the wheels of a thrashing chariot, new and turned back
upon themselves;”3952 and thou shalt thrash the mountains, and shalt beat the hills small,
and shalt make them as chaff, and shall winnow them; and the wind shall seize them, and
the whirlwind shall scatter them: but thou shalt rejoice in the saints of Israel; and the poor
and needy shall exult. For they shall seek water, and there shall be none. For their tongue
shall be dry for thirst. I the Lord God, I the God of Israel, will hear them, and will not forsake
them; but I will open rivers in the mountains, and fountains in the midst of the fields. I will
make the wildernesses watery groves, and a thirsty land into watercourses. I will establish
in the land of drought the cedar-tree and the box-tree, and the myrtle and the cypress, and
the elm3953 and the poplar, that they may see and acknowledge, and know and believe together,
that the Hand of the Lord hath done these things, and the Holy One of Israel hath
shown them.”3954</p>

<p>5. That Christ is at once Angel and God.3955</p>
<p>In Genesis, to Abraham: “And the Angel of the Lord called him from heaven, and said
unto him, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I. And He said, Lay not thine hand
upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest thy God,
and hast not spared thy son, thy beloved son, for my sake.”3956 Also in the same place, to
Jacob: “And the Angel of the Lord spake unto me in dreams, I am God, whom thou sawest
in the place of God3957 where thou anointedst me a pillar of stone, and vowedst to me a
vow.”3958 Also in Exodus: “But God went before them by day indeed in a pillar of cloud, to
show them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire.”3959 And afterwards, in the same place:
“And the Angel of God moved forward, which went before the army of the children of Israel.”
3960 Also in the same place: “Lo, I send my Angel before thy face, to keep thee in the
way, that He may lead thee into the land which I have prepared for thee. Observe Him, and
obey Him, and be not disobedient to Him, and He will not be wanting to thee. For my Name
is in Him.”3961 Whence He Himself says in the Gospel: “I came in the name of my Father,
and ye received me not. When another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.”3962
And again in the cxviith Psalm: “Blessed is He who cometh in the name of the Lord.”3963
Also in Malachi: “My covenant of life and peace was with Levi;3964 and I gave him fear, that
he should fear me, that he should go from the face of my name. The law of truth was in his
mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. In the peace of the tongue correcting,
he walked with us, and turned many away from unrighteousness. Because the lips of the
priests shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at His mouth; for He is the Angel
of the Almighty.”3965</p>

<p>6. That Christ is God.</p>
<p>In Genesis: “And God said unto Jacob, Arise, and go up to the place of Bethel, and dwell
there; and make there an altar to that God who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from
the face of thy brother Esau.”3966 Also in Isaiah: “Thus saith the Lord, the God of Sabaoth,
Egypt is wearied; and the merchandise of the Ethiopians, and the tall men of the Sabeans,
shall pass over unto Thee, and shall be Thy servants; and shall walk after Thee bound with
chains; and shall worship Thee, and shall pray to Thee, because God is in Thee, and there
is no other God beside Thee. For Thou art God, and we knew it not, O God of Israel, our
Saviour. They shall all be confounded and fear who oppose Thee, and shall fall into confusion.”
3967 Likewise in the same: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God. Every channel shall be filled up, and
every mountain and hill shall be made low, and all crooked places shall be made straight,
and rough places plain; and the glory of the Lord shall be seen, and all flesh shall see the
salvation of God, because the Lord hath spoken it.”3968 Moreover, in Jeremiah: This is our
God, and no other shall be esteemed beside Him, who hath found all the way of knowledge,
and hath given it to Jacob His son, and to Israel His beloved. After this He was seen upon
earth, and He conversed with men.”3969 Also in Zechariah God says: “And they shall cross
over through the narrow sea, and they shall smite the waves in the sea, and they shall dry
up all the depths of the rivers; and all the haughtiness of the Assyrians shall be confounded,
and the sceptre of Egypt shall be taken away. And I will strengthen them in the Lord their
God, and in His name shall they glory, saith the Lord.”3970 Moreover, in Hosea the Lord
saith: “I will not do according to the anger of mine indignation, I will not allow Ephraim to
be destroyed: for I am God, and there is not a holy man in thee: and I will not enter into the
city; I will go after God.”3971 Also in the forty-fourth Psalm: “Thy throne, O God, is for ever
and ever: the sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved
righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the
oil of gladness above Thy fellows.”3972 So, too, in the forty-fifth Psalm: “Be still, and know
that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.”3973

unto His name: make a way for Him who goeth up into the west: God is His name.”3975
Also in the Gospel according to John: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and God was the Word.”3976 Also in the same: “The Lord said to Thomas, Reach
hither thy finger, and behold my hands: and be not faithless, but believing. Thomas answered
and said unto Him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me,
thou hast believed: blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed.”3977 Also
Paul to the Romans: “I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren
and my kindred according to the flesh: who are Israelites: whose are the adoption, and the
glory, and the covenant, and the appointment of the law, and the service (of God), and the
promises; whose are the fathers, of whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is God
over all, blessed for evermore.”3978 Also in the Apocalypse: “I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end: I will give to him that is athirst, of the fountain of living water freely.
He that overcometh shall possess these things, and their inheritance; and I will be his God,
and he shall be my son.”3979 Also in the eighty-first Psalm: “God stood in the congregation
of gods, and judging gods in the midst.”3980 And again in the same place: “I have said, Ye
are gods; and ye are all the children of the Highest: but ye shall die like men.”3981 But if they
who have been righteous, and have obeyed the divine precepts, may be called gods, how
much more is Christ, the Son of God, God! Thus He Himself says in the Gospel according
to John: “Is it not written in the law, that I said, Ye are gods? If He called them gods to whom
the word of God was given, and the Scripture cannot be relaxed, do ye say to Him whom
the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, that thou blasphemest, because I said, I
am the Son of God? But if I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but if I do, and
ye will not believe me, believe the works, and know that the Father is in me, and I in
Him.”3982 Also in the Gospel according to Matthew: “And ye shall call His name Emmanuel,

<p>7. That Christ our God should come, the Enlightener and Saviour of the human race.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “Be comforted, ye weakened hands; and ye weak knees, be strengthened. Ye
who are of a timorous heart, fear not. Our God will recompense judgment, He Himself will
come, and will save us. Then shall be opened the eyes of the blind, and the ears of the deaf
shall hear. Then the lame man shall leap as a stag, and the tongue of the dumb shall be intelligible;
because in the wilderness the water is broken forth, and the stream in the thirsty
land.”3984 Also in that place: “Not an elder nor an angel, but the Lord Himself shall deliver
them; because He shall love them, and shall spare them, and He Himself shall redeem
them.”3985 Also in the same place: “I the Lord God have called Thee in righteousness, that
I may hold Thine hand, and I will comfort Thee; and I have given Thee for a covenant of
my people, for a light of the nations; to open the eyes of the blind, to bring forth them that
are bound from chains, and those who sit in darkness from the prison-house. I am the Lord
God, that is my name. I will not give my glory to another, nor my powers to graven im-
ages.”3986 Also in the twenty-fourth Psalm: “Show me Thy ways, O Lord, and teach me Thy
paths, and lead me unto Thy truth, and teach me; for Thou art the God of my salvation.”3987
Whence, in the Gospel according to John, the Lord says: “I am the light of the world. He
that will follow me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”3988 Moreover,
in that according to Matthew, the angel Gabriel says to Joseph: “Joseph, thou son of David,
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife. For that which shall be born to her is of the Holy
Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save
His people from their sins.”3989 Also in that according to Luke: “And Zacharias was filled
with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath
foreseen redemption for His people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the
house of His servant David.”3990 Also in the same place, the angel said to the shepherds:
“Fear not; for, behold, I bring you tidings that unto you is born this day in the city of David
a Saviour, which is Christ Jesus.”3991</p>

<p>8. That although from the beginning He had been the Son of God, yet He had to be begotten

<p>In the second Psalm: “The Lord said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten
Thee. Ask of me, and I will give Thee the nations for Thine inheritance, and the bounds of
the earth for Thy possession.”3992 Also in the Gospel according to Luke: “And it came to
pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and she
was filled with the Holy Ghost, and she cried out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence does this happen to
me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?”3993 Also Paul to the Galatians: “But
when the fulness of the time was come, God sent His Son, born of a woman.”3994 Also in
the Epistle of John: “Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of
God. But whosoever denies that He is come in the flesh is not of God, but is of the spirit of
Antichrist.”3995</p>

<p>9. That this should be the sign of His nativity, that He should be born of a virgin—man and
God—a son of man and a Son of God.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “And the Lord went on to speak to Ahaz, saying, Ask thee a sign from the
Lord thy God, in the height above and in the depth below. And Ahaz said, I will not ask,
and I will not tempt the Lord my God. And He said, Hear ye, therefore, O house of David:
it is no trifling contest unto you with men, since God supplies the struggle. On this account
God Himself will give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and
ye shall call His name Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall He eat; before that He knows to
prefer the evil, He shall exchange the good.”3996 This seed God had foretold would proceed
from the woman that should trample on the head of the devil. In Genesis: “Then God said
unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from every kind of the beasts
of the earth. Upon thy breast and thy belly shalt thou crawl, and earth shall be thy food all
the days of thy life. And I will place enmity between thee and the woman and her seed. He
shall regard thy head, and thou shalt watch his heel.”3997</p>
<note type="footnote">3996 Isa. vii. 10–15. The ordinary reading here is, “before He knows, to refuse the evil and to choose the

<p>10. That Christ is both man and God, compounded of both natures, that He might be a
Mediator between us and the Father.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah: “And He is man, and who shall know Him?”3998 Also in Numbers: “A Star
shall arise out of Jacob, and a man shall rise up from Israel.”3999 Also in the same place: “A
Man shall go forth out of his seed,4000 and shall rule over many nations; and His kingdom
shall be exalted as Gog,4001 and His kingdom shall be increased; and God brought Him
forth out of Egypt. His glory is as of the unicorn, and He shall eat the nations of His enemies,
and shall take out the marrow of their fatnesses, and will pierce His enemy with His arrows.
He couched and lay down as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp. Who shall raise Him up? Blessed
are they who bless Thee, and cursed are they who curse Thee.”4002 Also in Isaiah: “The
Spirit of the Lord is upon me; on account whereof He hath anointed me: He hath sent me
to tell good tidings to the poor; to heal the bruised in heart, to preach deliverance to the
captives, and sight to the blind, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of
retribution.”4003 Whence, in the Gospel according to Luke, Gabriel says to Mary: “And the
angel, answering, said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
Highest shall overshadow thee. Wherefore that holy thing which is born of thee shall be
called the Son of God.”4004 Also in the first Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians: “The first
man is of the mud4005 of the earth; the second man is from heaven. As was he from the soil,
such are they also that are of the earth; and as is the heavenly, such also are the heavenly.
As we have borne the image of him who is of the earth, let us also bear the image of Him
who is from heaven.”4006</p>

<p>In the second of Kings: “And the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, Go and tell
my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in; but
it shall come to pass, when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,
I will raise up thy seed after thee who shall come from thy loins, and I will establish His
kingdom. He shall build me a house in my name, and I will set up His throne for ever; and
I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to me a Son; and His house shall obtain confidence,
and His kingdom for ever in my sight.”4007 Also in Isaiah: “And a rod shall go forth of the
root of Jesse, and a flower shall go up from his root; and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest
upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
spirit of knowledge and piety; and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.”4008 Also
in the cxxxist Psalm: “God hath sworn the truth unto David himself, and He has not repudiated
it; of the fruit of thy belly will I set upon my throne.”4009 Also in the Gospel according
to Luke: “And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary. For thou hast found favour before
God. Behold, thou shalt conceive, and shalt bring forth a son, and shalt call His name Jesus.
The same shall be great, and He shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God
shall give Him the throne of His father David, and He shall reign over the house of Jacob
for ever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end.”4010 Also in the Apocalypse: “And I saw
in the right hand of God, who sate on the throne, a book written within, and on the back
sealed with seven seals; and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
worthy to receive the book, and to open its seals? Nor was there any one either in heaven
or upon the earth, or under the earth, who was able to open the book, nor even to look into
it. And I wept much because nobody was found worthy to open the book, nor to look into
it. And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the

revealed? We have declared in His presence as children, as a root in a thirsty ground. There
is no form nor glory in Him; and we saw Him, and He had no form nor beauty; but His
form was without honour, and lacking beyond other men. He was a man set in a plague,
and knowing how to bear weakness; because His face was turned away, He was dishonoured,
and was not accounted of. He bears our sins, and grieves for us; and we thought that He
was in grief, and in wounding, and in affliction; but He was wounded for our transgressions,
and He was weakened4014 for our sins. The discipline of our peace was upon Him, and with
His bruise we are healed. We all like sheep have gone astray; man has gone out of his way.
And God has delivered Him for our sins; and He, because He was afflicted, opened not His
mouth.”4015 Also in the same: “I am not rebellious, nor do I contradict. I gave my back to
the stripes, and my cheeks to the palms of the hands. Moreover, I did not turn away my face
from the foulness of spitting, and God was my helper.”4016 Also in the same: “He shall not
cry, nor will any one hear His voice in the streets. He shall not break a bruised reed, and a
smoking flax He shall not extinguish; but He shall bring forth judgment in truth. He shall
shine forth, and shall not be shaken, until He set judgment in the earth, and in His name
shall the nations trust.”4017 Also in the twenty-first Psalm: “But I am a worm, and no man;
the accursed of man, and the casting away of the people. All they who saw me despised me,
and spoke within their lips, and moved their head. He hoped in the Lord, let Him deliver
him; let Him save him, since he will have Him.”4018 Also in that place: “My strength is dried
up like a potsherd, and my tongue is glued to my jaws.”4019 Also in Zechariah: “And the
Lord showed me Jesus, that great priest, standing before the face of the Angel of the Lord,
and the devil was standing at his right hand to oppose him. And Jesus was clothed in filthy
garments, and he stood before the face of the Angel Himself; and He answered and said to
them who were standing before His face, saying, Take away his filthy garments from him.

but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men;
and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto
death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore also God exalted Him, and gave Him a name
which is above every name, that in the name4023 of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
in heaven, of things in earth, and of infernal things, and every tongue should confess that

<p>14. That He is the righteous One whom the Jews should put to death.</p>
<p>In the Wisdom of Solomon: “Let us lay hold of the righteous, because He is disagreeable
to us, and is contrary to our works, and reproacheth us with our transgressions of the law.4025
He professeth that He has the knowledge of God, and calls Himself the Son of God; He has
become to us an exposure of our thoughts; He is grievous unto us even to look upon, because
His life is unlike to others, and His ways are changed. We are esteemed by Him as frivolous,
and He restraineth Himself from our ways, as if from uncleanness; and He extols the last
end of the righteous, and boasts that He has God for His Father. Let us see, then, if His
words are true, and let us try what will come to Him. Let us interrogate Him with reproach
and torture, that we may know His reverence and prove His patience. Let us condemn Him
with a most shameful death. These things they considered, and erred. For their maliciousness
hath blinded them, and they knew not the sacraments of God.”4026 Also in Isaiah: “See ye
how the righteous perisheth, and no man understandeth; and righteous men are taken away,
and no man regardeth. For the righteous man is taken away from the face of unrighteousness,
and his burial shall be in peace.”4027 Concerning this very thing it was before foretold in
Exodus: “Thou shalt not slay the innocent and the righteous.”4028 Also in the Gospel: “Judas,

<p>15. That Christ is called a sheep and a lamb who was to be slain, and concerning the sacrament
(mystery) of the passion.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is
dumb, so He opened not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away: who
shall relate His nativity? Because His life shall be taken away from the earth. By the transgressions
of my people He was led to death; and I will give the wicked for His burial, and
the rich themselves for His death; because He did no wickedness, nor deceits with His mouth.
Wherefore He shall gain many, and shall divide the spoils of the strong; because His soul
was delivered up to death, and He was counted among transgressors. And He bare the sins
of many, and was delivered for their offences.”4030 Also in Jeremiah: “Lord, give me knowledge,
and I shall know it: then I saw their meditations. I was led like a lamb without malice
to the slaughter; against me they devised a device, saying, Come, let us cast the tree into His
bread,4031 and let us erase His life from the earth, and His name shall no more be a remembrance.”
4032 Also in Exodus God said to Moses: “Let them take to themselves each man a
sheep, through the houses of the tribes, a sheep without blemish, perfect, male, of a year old
it shall be to you. Ye shall take it from the lambs and from the goats, and all the congregation
of the synagogue of the children of Israel shall kill it in the evening; and they shall take of
its blood, and shall place it upon the two posts,4033 and upon the threshold in the houses,
in the very houses in which they shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh on the same night,
roasted with fire; and they shall eat unleavened bread with bitter herbs.4034 Ye shall not eat
of them raw nor dressed in water, but roasted with fire; the head with the feet and the inward
parts. Ye shall leave nothing of them to the morning; and ye shall not break a bone of it. But
what of it shall be left to the morning shall be burnt with fire. But thus ye shall eat it; your
loins girt, and your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hands; and ye shall eat it in
haste: for it is the Lord’s passover.”4035 Also in the Apocalypse: “And I saw in the midst of
the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing
as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth
throughout all the earth. And He came and took the book from the right hand of God, who

eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it. O Lord, save
therefore, O Lord, direct therefore. Blessed is He who cometh in the name of the Lord.”4040
Also in Zechariah: “Behold, I bring forth my servant. The Orient is his name, because the
stone which I have placed before the face of Jesus; upon that one stone are seven eyes.”4041
Also in Deuteronomy: “And thou shalt write upon the stone all this law, very plainly.”4042
Also in Jesus the son of Nave: “And he took a great stone, and placed it there before the
Lord; and Jesus said unto the people, Behold, this stone shall be to you for a testimony, because
it hath heard all the things which were spoken by the Lord, which He hath spoken to
you to-day; and it shall be for a testimony to you in the last of the days, when ye shall have
departed from your God.”4043 Also in the Acts of the Apostles, Peter: “Ye princes of the
people, and elders of Israel, hearken: Behold, we are this day interrogated by you about the
good deed done to the impotent man, by means of which he is made whole. Be it known
unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
whom ye have crucified, whom God hath raised up from the dead, by Him he stands whole
in your presence, but by none other. This is the stone which was despised by you builders,
which has become the head of the corner. For there is no other name given to men under
heaven in which we must be saved.”4044 This is the stone in Genesis, which Jacob places at
his head, because the head of the man is Christ; and as he slept he saw a ladder reaching to
heaven, on which the Lord was placed, and angels were ascending and descending.4045 And
this stone he designating Christ consecrated and anointed with the sacrament of unction.
This is the stone in Exodus upon which Moses sate on the top of a hill when Jesus the son
of Nave fought against Amalek; and by the sacrament of the stone, and the stedfastness of
his sitting, Amalek was overcome by Jesus, that is, the devil was overcome by Christ. This
is the great stone in the first book of Kings, upon which was placed the ark of the covenant

<p>17. That afterwards this Stone should become a mountain, and should fill the whole earth.</p>
<p>In Daniel: “And behold a very great image; and the aspect of this image was fearful, and
it stood erect before thee; whose head was of fine gold, its breast and arms were silver, its
belly and thighs were of brass, and its feet were partly indeed of iron, and partly of clay,
until that a stone was cut4047 out of the mountain, without the hands of those that should
cut it, and struck the image upon the feet of iron and clay, and brake them into small fragments.
And the iron, and the clay, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, was made altogether;
and they became small as chaff, or dust in the threshing-floor in summer; and the
wind blew them away, so that nothing remained of them. And the stone which struck the
image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.”4048</p>

<p>18. That in the last times the same mountain should be manifested, and upon it the Gentiles
should come, and on it all the righteous should go up.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “In the last times the mountain of the Lord shall be revealed, and the house
of God upon the tops of the mountains; and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations
shall come upon it, and many shall walk and say, Come, and let us go up into the mountain
of the Lord, and into the house of the God of Jacob; and He will tell us His way, and we will
walk in it. For from Sion shall proceed the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem;
and He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke much people; and they shall beat
their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks, and they shall no more
learn to fight.”4049 Also in the twenty-third Psalm: “Who shall ascend into the hill of the
Lord, or who shall stand in His holy place? He that is innocent in his hands, and of a clean
heart; who hath not received his life in vanity, and hath not sworn craftily to his neighbour.
He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and mercy4050 from the God that saveth him.
This is the generation of those who seek Him, that seek the face of the God of Jacob.”4051</p>

<p>19. That Christ is the Bridegroom, having the Church as His bride, from which spiritual
children were to be born.</p>
<p>In Joel: “Blow with the trumpet in Sion; sanctify a fast, and call a healing; assemble the
people, sanctify the Church, gather the elders, collect the little ones that suck the breast; let
the Bridegroom go forth of His chamber, and the bride out of her closet.”4052 Also in
Jeremiah: “And I will take away from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem,
the voice of the joyous, and the voice of the glad; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice
of the bride.”4053 Also in the eighteenth Psalm: “And he is as a bridegroom going forth from
his chamber; he exulted as a giant to run his course. From the height of heaven is his going
forth, and his circuit even to the end of it; and there is nothing which is hid from his heat.”4054
Also in the Apocalypse: “Come, I will show thee the new bride, the Lamb’s wife. And he
took me in the Spirit to a great mountain, and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem descending
out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.”4055 Also in the Gospel according
to John: “Ye are my witnesses, that I said to them who were sent from Jerusalem to me, that
I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him. For he who has the bride is the bridegroom;
but the friend of the bridegroom is he who standeth and heareth him with joy, and
rejoiceth because of the voice of the bridegroom.”4056 The mystery of this matter was shown
in Jesus the son of Nave, when he was bidden to put his shoes from off him, doubtless because
he himself was not the bridegroom. For it was in the law, that whoever should refuse marriage
should put off his shoe, but that he should be shod who was to be the bridegroom: “And it
happened, when Jesus was in Jericho, he looked around with his eyes, and saw a man
standing before his face, and holding a javelin4057 in his hand, and said, Art thou for us or
for our enemies? And he said, I am the leader of the host of the Lord; now draw near. And
Jesus fell on his face to the earth, and said to him, Lord, what dost Thou command unto
Thy servant. And the leader of the Lord’s host said, Loose thy shoe from thy feet, for the
place whereon thou standest is holy ground.”4058 Also, in Exodus, Moses is bidden to put
off his shoe, because he, too, was not the bridegroom: “And there appeared unto him the
angel of the Lord in a flame of fire out of a bush; and he saw that the bush burned with fire,
but the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will pass over and see this great sight,
why the bush is not consumed. But when He saw that he drew near to see, the Lord God

called him from the bush, saying, Moses, Moses. And he said, What is it? And He said,
Draw not nigh hither, unless thou hast loosed thy shoe from off thy feet; for the place on
which thou standest is holy ground. And He said unto him, I am the God of thy father, the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”4059 This was also made plain
in the Gospel according to John: “And John answered them, I indeed baptize with water,
but there standeth One in the midst of you whom ye know not: He it is of whom I said, The
man that cometh after me is made before me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to
unloose.”4060 Also according to Luke: “Let your loins be girt, and your lamps burning, and
ye like to men that wait for their master when he shall come from the wedding, that when
he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him. Blessed are those servants whom their
Lord, when He cometh, shall find watching.”4061 Also in the Apocalypse: “The Lord God

<p>20. That the Jews would fasten Christ to the cross.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “I have spread out my hands all day to a people disobedient and contradicting
me, who walk in ways that are not good, but after their own sins.”4063 Also in Jeremiah:
“Come, let us cast the tree into His bread, and let us blot out His life from the earth.”4064
Also in Deuteronomy: “And Thy life shall be hanging (in doubt) before Thine eyes; and
Thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt not trust to Thy life.”4065 Also in the twenty-first
Psalm: “They tore my hands and my feet;4066 they numbered all my bones. And they gazed
upon me, and saw me, and divided my garments among them, and upon my vesture they
cast a lot. But Thou, O Lord, remove not Thy help far from me; attend unto my help. Deliver
my soul from the sword, and my only one from the paw4067 of the dog. Save me from the
mouth of the lion, and my lowliness from the horns of the unicorns. I will declare Thy name
unto my brethren; in the midst of the Church I will praise Thee.”4068 Also in the cxviiith
Psalm: “Pierce my flesh with nails through fear of Thee.”4069 Also in the cxlth Psalm: “The
lifting up of my hands is an evening sacrifice.”4070 Of which sacrifice Sophonias said: “Fear
from the presence of the Lord God, since His day is near, because the Lord hath prepared
His sacrifice, He hath sanctified His elect.”4071 Also in Zechariah: “And they shall look upon
me, whom they have pierced.”4072 Also in the eighty-seventh Psalm: “I have called unto
Thee, O Lord, the whole day; I have stretched out my hands unto Thee.”4073 Also in Numbers:
“Not as a man is God suspended, nor as the son of man does He suffer threats.”4074 Whence
in the Gospel the Lord says: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in the Son may have life eternal.”4075</p>

<p>21. That in the passion and the sign of the cross is all virtue and power.</p>
<p>In Habakkuk: “His virtue covered the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise, and
His splendour shall be as the light; there shall be horns in His hands. And there the virtue
of His glory was established, and He founded His strong love. Before His face shall go the
Word, and shall go forth unto the plains according to His steps.”4076 In Isaiah also: “Behold,
unto us a child is born, and to us a Son is given, upon whose shoulders shall be government;
and His name shall be called the Messenger of a mighty thought.”4077 By this sign of the
cross also Amalek was conquered by Jesus through Moses. In Exodus Moses said to Jesus:
“Choose thee out men, and go forth, and order yourselves with Amalek until the morrow.
Behold, I will stand on the top of the hill, and the rod of God in mine hand. And it came to
pass, when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel prevailed; but when Moses had let down his
hands, Amalek waxed strong. But the hands of Moses were heavy; and they took a stone,
and placed it under him, and he sat upon it and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, on the
one side and on the other side; and the hands of Moses were made steady even to the setting
of the sun. And Jesus routed Amalek and all his people. And the Lord said unto Moses,
Write this, that it may be a memorial in a book, and tell it unto the ears of Jesus, that I may
utterly destroy the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”4078</p>

sign upon the men’s foreheads, who groan and grieve for the iniquities which are done in
the midst of them.”4080 Also in the same place: “Go and smite, and do not spare your eyes.
Have no pity on the old man, and the youth, and the virgin, and slay little children and
women, that they may be utterly destroyed. But ye shall not touch any one upon whom the
sign is written, and begin with my holy places themselves.”4081 Also in Exodus God says to
Moses: “And there shall be blood for a sign to you upon the houses wherein ye shall be; and
I will look on the blood, and will protect you. And there shall not be in you the plague of
wasting when I shall smite the land of Egypt.”4082 Also in the Apocalypse: “And I saw4083
a Lamb standing on Mount Sion, and with Him a hundred and forty and four thousand;
and they had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.”4084 Also

end. Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have power over the tree

the clouds of heaven, came even to the Ancient of days, and stood in His sight. And they
who stood beside Him brought Him before Him: and to Him was given a royal power, and
all the kings of the earth by their generation, and all glory obeying Him: and His power is
eternal, which shall not be taken away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.”4096 Also
in Isaiah: “Now will I arise, saith the Lord; now will I be glorified, now will I be exalted, now
ye shall see, now ye shall understand, now ye shall be confounded. Vain will be the strength
of your spirit: the fire shall consume you.”4097 Also in the cixth Psalm: “The Lord said unto
my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies the footstool of Thy feet.
God will send the rod of Thy power out of Sion, and Thou shalt rule in the midst of Thine
enemies.”4098 Also in the Apocalypse: “And I turned and looked to see the voice which
spake with me. And I saw seven golden candlesticks, and in the midst of the candlesticks
one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a long garment,4099 and He was girt about the
paps with a golden girdle. And His head and His hairs were white as wool or snow, and His
eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like to fine brass from a furnace of fire, and His voice
like the sound of many waters. And He had in His right hand seven stars: and out of His
mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun in his might. And when
I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand upon me, and said, Fear
not; I am the first and the last, and He that liveth and was dead; and, lo, I am living for
evermore4100 and I have the keys of death and of hell.”4101 Likewise in the Gospel, the Lord
after His resurrection says to His disciples: “All power is given unto me in heaven and in

and all the wicked shall be as stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
Lord.”4112 Also in the forty-ninth (or fiftieth) Psalm: “God the Lord of gods hath spoken,
and called the earth. From the rising of the sun even to the going down thereof, out of Sion
is the beauty of His glory. God shall come manifestly, our God, and shall not keep silence.
A fire shall burn before Him, and round about Him shall be a great storm. He hath called
the heaven above, and the earth, that He may separate His people. Gather together His saints
unto Him, those who arrange His covenant with sacrifices. And the heavens shall announce
His righteousness, for God is the judge.”4113 Also in Isaiah: “The Lord God of strength shall
go forth, and shall break war in pieces: He shall stir up contest, and shall cry over His enemies
with strength. I have been silent; shall I always be silent?”4114 Also in the sixty-seventh
Psalm: “Let God arise, and let His enemies be scattered: and let those who hate Him flee
from His face. As smoke vanisheth, let them vanish: as wax melteth from the face of fire,
thus let the sinners perish from the face of God. And let the righteous be glad and rejoice
in the sight of God: and let them be glad with joyfulness. Sing unto God, sing praises unto
His name: make a way to Him who goeth up into the west. God is His name. They shall be
put to confusion from the face of Him who is the Father of the orphans, and the Judge of
the widows. God is in His holy place: God, who maketh men to dwell with one mind in an
house, bringing forth them that are bound with might, and equally those who provoke unto
anger, who dwell in the sepulchres: God, when Thou wentest forth in the sight of Thy people,
in passing into the desert.”4115 Also in the eighty-first Psalm: “Arise, O God; judge the earth:
for Thou wilt exterminate among all nations.”4116 Also in the Gospel according to Matthew:
“What have we to do with Thee, Thou Son of David? why art Thou come hither to punish

given all judgment to the Son, that all may honour the Son as they honour the Father. He
that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father who hath sent Him.”4118 So too in

<p>29. That He will reign as a King for ever.</p>
<p>In Zechariah: “Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee: just,
and having salvation; meek, sitting upon an ass that hath not been tamed.”4120 Also in
Isaiah: “Who will declare to you that eternal place? He that walketh in righteousness, and
holdeth back his hands from gifts; stopping his ears that he may not hear the judgment of
blood; and closing his eyes, that he may not see unrighteousness: this man shall dwell in the
lofty cavern of the strong rock; bread shall be given him, and his water shall be sure. Ye shall
see the King with glory.”4121 Likewise in Malachi: “I am a great King, saith the Lord, and
my name is illustrious among the nations.”4122 Also in the second Psalm: “But I am established
as a King by Him upon His holy hill of Zion, announcing His empire.”4123 Also in
the twenty-first Psalm: “All the ends of the world shall be reminded, and shall turn to the
Lord: and all the countries of the nations shall worship in Thy sight. For the kingdom is the
Lord’s: and He shall rule over all nations.”4124 Also in the twenty-third Psalm: “Lift up your
gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come
in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord strong in battle. Lift
up your gates, O ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory
shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.”4125
Also in the forty-fourth Psalm: “My heart hath breathed forth a good discourse:4126 I tell
my works to the king: my tongue is the pen of a writer intelligently writing. Thou art lovely
in beauty above the children of men: grace is shed forth on Thy lips, because God hath
blessed Thee for ever. Be girt with Thy sword on Thy thigh, O most mighty. To Thy honour
and to Thy beauty both attend, and direct Thyself, and reign, because of truth, and meekness,
and righteousness.”4127 Also in the fifth Psalm: “My King, and my God, because unto Thee
will I pray. O Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear my voice; in the morning I will stand
before Thee, and will contemplate Thee.”4128 Also in the ninety-sixth Psalm: “The Lord
hath reigned; let the earth rejoice; let the many isles be glad.”4129 Moreover, in the fortyfourth
Psalm: “The queen stood at thy right hand in a golden garment; she is clothed in

thy father’s house; for the King hath desired thy beauty, for He is thy Lord God.”4130 Also
in the seventy-third Psalm: “But God is our King before the world; He hath wrought salvation
in the midst of the earth.”4131 Also in the Gospel according to Matthew: “And when Jesus
was born in Bethlehem of Judah in the days of Herod the king, behold, Magi from the east
came to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He who is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His
star in the east, and have come to worship Him.”4132 Also, according to John, Jesus said:
“My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be
in trouble, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from
hence. Pilate said, Art thou a king, then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. For
this cause I was born, and for this cause I am come into the world, that I might bear testimony
to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.”4133</p>

<p>30. That He Himself is both Judge and King.</p>
<p>In the seventy-first Psalm: “O God, give Thy judgment to the king, and Thy righteousness
to the king’s son, to judge Thy people in righteousness.”4134 Also in the Apocalypse: “And
I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and He who sate upon him was called
Faithful and True; and He judgeth justice and righteousness, and maketh war. And His eyes
were, as it were, a flame of fire, and upon His head were many crowns; and He bare a name
written that was known to none other than Himself: and He was clothed with a garment
sprinkled with blood, and His name is called the Word of God. And the armies which are
in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in linen white and clean. And out of His
mouth went forth a sword with two edges, that with it He should smite the nations, which
He shall shepherd4135 with a rod of iron; and He shall tread the winepress of the wrath of
God Almighty. Also He has on His garment and on His thigh the name written, King of
kings, and Lord of lords.”4136 Likewise in the Gospel: “When the Son of man shall come in
His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit in the throne of His glory; and all
nations shall be gathered together before Him, and He shall separate them one from another,
even as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; and He shall place the sheep at His
right hand, but the goats at His left hand. Then shall the King say unto them who shall be
at His right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom which is prepared
for you from the beginning of the world: for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was
thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye received me: naked, and ye clothed
me: sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the righteous
answer, and say unto Him, Lord, when saw we Thee hungry, and fed Thee? thirsty, and gave
Thee to drink? And when saw we Thee a stranger, and received Thee? naked, and clothed
Thee? And when saw we Thee sick, and in prison, and came unto Thee? And the King, answering,
shall say unto them, Verily I say unto you, In as far as ye have done it to the least
of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Then shall He say unto them who shall be
on His left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father hath
prepared4137 for the devil and his angels: for I have been hungry, and ye gave me not to
eat: I have been thirsty, and ye gave me not to drink: I was a stranger, and ye received me
not: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall
they also answer and say, Lord, when saw we Thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked,
or sick, or in prison, and have not ministered unto Thee? And He shall answer unto them,

<p>Cyprian to his son Quirinus,4139 greeting. Of your faith and devotion which you
manifest to the Lord God, beloved son, you asked me to gather out for your instruction
from the Holy Scriptures some heads bearing upon the religious teaching of our school;4140
seeking for a succinct course of sacred reading, so that your mind, surrendered to God,
might not be wearied with long or numerous volumes of books, but, instructed with a
summary of heavenly precepts, might have a wholesome and large compendium for nourishing
its memory. And because I owe you a plentiful and loving obedience, I have done
what you wished. I have laboured for once, that you might not always labour.4141 Therefore,
as much as my small ability could embrace, I have collected certain precepts of the Lord,
and divine teachings, which may be easy and useful to the readers, in that a few things digested
into a short space are both quickly read through, and are frequently repeated. I bid you,
beloved son, ever heartily farewell.</p>

<head>Testimonies.</head>
<p>1. Of the benefit of good works and mercy.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “Cry aloud,” saith He, “and spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet; tell my
people their sins, and the house of Jacob their wickednesses. They seek me from day to day,
and desire to know my ways, as a people which did righteousness, and did not forsake the
judgment of God. They ask of me now a righteous judgment, and desire to approach to
God, saying, What! because we have fasted, and Thou hast not seen: we have humiliated
our souls, and Thou hast not known. For in the days of fasting are found your own wills;
for either ye torment those who are subjected to you, or ye fast for strifes and judgments,
or ye strike your neighbours with fists. For what do you fast unto me, that to-day your voice
should be heard in clamour? This fast I have not chosen, save that a man should humble
his soul. And if thou shalt bend thy neck like a ring, and spread under thee sackcloth and
ashes, neither thus shall it be called an acceptable fast. Not such a fast have I chosen, saith
the Lord; but loose every knot of unrighteousness, let go the chokings of impotent engagements.
4145 Send away the harassed into rest, and scatter every unrighteous contract. Break
thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor into thy dwelling. If thou seest the
naked, clothe him; and despise not them of thy own seed in thy house. Then shall thy seasonable
light break forth, and thy garments shall quickly arise; and righteousness shall go
before thee: and the glory of God shall surround thee. Then thou shalt cry out, and God
shall hear thee; while thou art yet speaking, He shall say, Here I am.”4146 Concerning this
same thing in Job: “I have preserved the needy from the hand of the mighty; and I have
helped the orphan, to whom there was no helper. The mouth of the widow blessed me, since
I was the eye of the blind; I was also the foot of the lame, and the father of the weak.”4147
Of this same matter in Tobit: “And I said to Tobias, My son, go and bring whatever poor
man thou shalt find out of our brethren, who still has God in mind with his whole heart.
Bring him hither, and he shall eat my dinner together with me. Behold, I attend thee, my
son, until thou come.”4148 Also in the same place: “All the days of thy life, my son, keep
God in mind, and transgress not His precepts. Do justice all the days of thy life, and do not
walk in the way of unrighteousness; because if thou act truly, there will be respect of thy
works. Give alms of thy substance, and turn not thy face from any poor man. So shall it
come to pass that the face of God shall not be turned away from thee. Even as thou hast, my
son, so do: if thou hast abundant substance, give the more alms therefrom; if thou hast little,

communicate even of that little. And do not fear when thou givest alms: thou layest up for
thyself a good reward against the day of need; because alms delivereth from death, and does
not suffer to go into darkness. Alms is a good office for all who do it in the sight of the most
high God.”4149 On this same subject in Solomon in Proverbs: “He that hath pity on the poor
lendeth unto the Lord.”4150 Also in the same place: “He that giveth to the poor shall never
want; but he who turns away his eye shall be in much penury.”4151 Also in the same place:
“Sins are purged away by alms-giving and faith.”4152 Again, in the same place: “If thine enemy
hunger, feed him; and if he thirst, give him to drink: for by doing this thou shalt scatter live
coals upon his head.”4153 Again, in the same place: “As water extinguishes fire, so almsgiving
extinguishes sin.”4154 In the same in Proverbs: “Say not, Go away, and return, tomorrow
I will give; when you can do good immediately. For thou knowest not what may
happen on the coming day.”4155 Also in the same place: “He who stoppeth his ears that he
may not hear the weak, shall himself call upon God, and there shall be none to hear him.”4156
Also in the same place: “He who has his conversation without reproach in righteousness,
leaves blessed children.”4157 In the same in Ecclesiasticus: “My son, if thou hast, do good
by thyself, and present worthy offerings to God; remember that death delayeth not.”4158
Also in the same place: “Shut up alms in the heart of the poor, and this will entreat for thee
from all evil.”4159 Concerning this thing in the thirty-sixth Psalm, that mercy is beneficial
also to one’s posterity: “I have been young, and I have also grown old; and I have not seen
the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread. The whole day he is merciful, and
lendeth; and his seed is in blessing.”4160 Of this same thing in the fortieth Psalm: “Blessed
is he who considereth over the poor and needy: in the evil day God will deliver him.”4161
Also in the cxith Psalm: “He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
shall remain from generation to generation.”4162 Of this same thing in Hosea: “I desire

mercy rather than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than whole burnt-offerings.”4163
Of this same thing also in the Gospel according to Matthew: “Blessed are they who hunger
and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be satisfied.”4164 Also in the same place: “Blessed
are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.”4165 Also in the same place: “Lay up for
yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves
do not dig through and steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”4166
Also in the same place: “The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly
pearls: and when he hath found a precious pearl, he went away and sold all that he had, and
bought it.”4167 That even a small work is of advantage, also in the same place: “And whoever
shall give to drink to one of the least of these a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple,
verily I say unto you, His reward shall not perish.”4168 That alms are to be denied to none,
also in the same place: “Give to every one that asketh thee; and from him who would wish
to borrow, be not turned away.”4169 Also in the same place: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep
the commandments. He saith, Which? Jesus saith unto him, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt
not commit adultery, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and mother: and,
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. The young man saith unto Him, All these things
have I observed: what lack I yet? Jesus saith unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all
that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow
me.”4170 Also in the same place: “When the Son of man shall come in His majesty, and all
the angels with Him, then He shall sit on the throne of His glory: and all nations shall be
gathered together before Him; and He shall separate them one from another, even as a
shepherd separates the sheep from the goats: and He shall place the sheep on the right hand,
but the goats on the left hand. Then shall the King say unto them that are on His right hand,
Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning

them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these my brethren,
ye did it unto me. Then shall He say unto them who are on His left hand, Depart from me,
ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father hath prepared for the devil and his angels:
for I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me not to drink: I

Thee? And He shall answer them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of
the least of these, ye did it not unto me. And these shall go away into everlasting burning:
but the righteous into life eternal.”4172 Concerning this same matter in the Gospel according
to Luke: “Sell your possessions, and give alms.”4173 Also in the same place: “He who made
that which is within, made that which is without also. But give alms, and, behold, all things
are pure unto you.”4174 Also in the same place: “Behold, the half of my substance I give to
the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said
unto him, that salvation has this day been wrought for this house, since he also is a son of
Abraham.”4175 Of this same thing also in the second Epistle to the Corinthians: “Let your
abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may be the supplement of your
want, that there may be equality: as it is written, He who had much had not excess; and he
who had little had no lack.”4176 Also in the same place: “He who soweth sparingly shall reap
also sparingly; and he who soweth in blessing shall reap also of blessing. But let every one
do as he has proposed in his heart: not as if sorrowfully, or of necessity: for God loveth a
cheerful giver.”4177 Also in the same place: “As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he
hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.”4178 Likewise in the same
place: “Now he who ministereth seed to the sower, shall both supply bread to be eaten, and
shall multiply your seed, and shall increase the growth of the fruits of your righteousness:
that in all things ye may be made rich.”4179 Also in the same place: “The administration of
this service has not only supplied that which is lacking to the saints, but has abounded by
much giving of thanks unto God.”4180 Of this same matter in the Epistle of John: “Whoso

to Luke: “When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor brethren, nor
neighbours, nor the rich; lest haply they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made
thee. But when thou makest a banquet, call the poor, the weak, the blind, and lame: and
thou shalt be blessed; because they have not the means of rewarding thee: but thou shalt be
recompensed in the resurrection of the just.”4182</p>

<p>2. In works and alms, even if by smallness of power less be done, that the will itself is sufficient.</p>
<p>In the second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians: “If there be a ready will, it is acceptable
according to what a man hath, not according to that which he hath not; nor let there be to
others a mitigation, but to you a burdening.4183</p>

<p>3. That charity and brotherly affection are to be religiously and stedfastly practised.</p>
<p>In Malachi: “Hath not one God created us? Is there not one Father of us all? Why have
ye certainly deserted every one his brother?”4184 Of this same thing according to John:
“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.”4185 Also in the same place: “This is my
commandment, That ye love one another, even as I have loved you. Greater love than this
has no man, than that one should lay down his life for his friends.”4186 Also in the same
place: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.”4187 Also in
the same place: “Verily I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth concerning
everything, whatever you shall ask it shall be given you from my Father which is in heaven.
For wherever two or three are gathered together in my name, I am with them.”4188 Of this
same thing in the first Epistle to the Corinthians: “And I indeed, brethren, could not speak
unto you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. I have given you milk for
drink, not meat: for while ye were yet little ye were not able to bear it, neither now are ye
able. For ye are still carnal: for where there are in you emulation, and strife, and dissensions,
are ye not carnal, and walk after man?”4189 Likewise in the same place: “And if I should
have all faith, so that I can remove mountains, but have not charity, I am nothing. And if I
should distribute all my goods for food, and if I should deliver up my body to be burned,
but have not charity, I avail nothing. Charity is great-souled; charity is kind; charity envieth
not; charity dealeth not falsely; is not puffed up; is not irritated; thinketh not evil; rejoiceth
not in injustice, but rejoiceth in the truth. It loveth all things, believeth all things, hopeth
all things, beareth all things. Charity shall never fail.”4190 Of this same thing to the Galatians:
“Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. But if ye bite and accuse one another, see that ye
be not consumed one of another.”4191 Of this same thing in the Epistle of John: “In this
appear the children of God and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not righteous is not
of God, and he who loveth not his brother. For he who hateth his brother is a murderer;
and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.”4192 Also in the same place:
“If any one shall say that he loves God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he who loveth

thing in the Acts of the Apostles: “But the multitude of them that had believed acted with
one soul and mind: nor was there among them any distinction, neither did they esteem as
their own anything of the possessions that they had; but all things were common to them.”4194
Of this same thing in the Gospel according to Matthew: If thou wouldest offer thy gift at
the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave thou thy
gift before the altar, and go; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
gift at the altar.”4195 Also in the Epistle of John: “God is love and he that dwelleth in love
dwelleth in God, and God in him.”4196 Also in the same place: “He who saith he is in the
light, and hateth his brother, is a liar, and walketh in darkness even until now.”4197</p>

thou that thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why boastest thou, as if thou
hadst not received it?”4199 Also in the first of Kings: “Boast not, neither speak lofty things,
and let not great speeches proceed out of your mouth, for the Lord is a God of knowledge.”
4200 Also in the same place: “The bow of the mighty men has been made weak, and
the weak are girt about with strength.”4201 Of this same thing in the Maccabees: “It is just
to be subjected to God, and that a mortal should not think things equal to God.”4202 Also
in the same place: “And fear not the words of a man that is a sinner, because his glory shall
be filth and worms. Today he shall be lifted up, and to-morrow he shall not be found; because
he is turned into his earth, and his thought has perished.”4203</p>

<p>5. That humility and quietness are to be maintained in all things.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “Thus saith the Lord God, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is the stool
of my feet. What seat will ye build for me, or what is the place for my rest? For all those
things hath my hand made, and all those things are mine. And upon whom else will I look,
except upon the lowly and quiet man, and him that trembleth at my words?”4204 On this
same thing in the Gospel according to Matthew: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit
the earth.”4205 Of this same thing, too, according to Luke: “He that shall be least among you
all, the same shall be great.”4206 Also in the same place: “Whosoever exalteth himself shall
be made low, and whosoever abaseth himself shall be exalted.”4207 Of this same thing to the
Romans: “Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God spared not the natural branches, (take
heed) lest He also spare not thee.”4208 Of this same thing in the thirty-third Psalm: “And
He shall save the lowly in spirit.”4209 Also to the Romans: “Render to all what is due: tribute
to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom
honour; owe no man anything, except to love another.”4210 Also in the Gospel according
to Matthew: “They love the first place of reclining at feasts, and the chief seat in the synagogues,
and salutations in the market, and to be called of men Rabbi. But call not ye Rabbi,
for One is your Master.”4211 Also in the Gospel according to John: “The servant is not
greater than his lord, nor the apostle greater than He that sent himself. If ye know these
things, blessed shall ye be if ye shall do them.”4212 Also in the eighty-first Psalm: “Do justice

<p>6. That all good and righteous men suffer more, but ought to endure because they are proved.</p>
<p>In Solomon: “The furnace proveth the vessels of the potter, and the trial of tribulation
righteous men.”4214 Also in the fiftieth Psalm: “The sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit; a
contrite and humbled heart God will not despise.”4215 Also in the thirty-third Psalm: “God
is nearest to them that are contrite in heart, and He will save the lowly in spirit.”4216 Also
in the same place: “Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but out of them all the Lord
will deliver them.”4217 Of this same matter in Job: “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb,
naked also shall I go under the earth: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath
pleased the Lord, so it is done; blessed be the name of the Lord. In all these things which
happened to him Job sinned in nothing with his lips in the sight of the Lord.”4218 Concerning
this same thing in the Gospel according to Matthew: “Blessed are they that mourn, for they
shall be comforted.”4219 Also according to John: “These things have I spoken unto you,
that in me ye may have peace. But in the world ye shall have affliction; but have confidence,
for I have overcome the world.”4220 Concerning this same thing in the second Epistle to
the Corinthians: “There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet
me, that I should not be exalted. For which thing I thrice besought the Lord, that it should
depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for strength is perfected
in weakness.”4221 Concerning this same thing to the Romans: “We glory in hope of the glory
of God. And not only so, but we also glory in afflictions: knowing that affliction worketh
patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope does not confound; because
the love of God is infused in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us.”4222
On this same subject, according to Matthew: “How broad and spacious is the way which
leadeth unto death, and many there are who go in thereby: how straight and narrow is the
way that leadeth to life, and few there are that find it!”4223 Of this same thing in Tobias:

<p>In Solomon in the Proverbs: “Better is a patient man than a strong man; for he who restrains
his anger is better than he who taketh a city.”4227 Also in the same place: “The imprudent
man declareth his anger on the same day, but the crafty man hideth away his dishonour.”
4228 Of this same thing to the Ephesians: “Be ye angry, and sin not. Let not the sun
set upon your wrath.”4229 Also in the Gospel according to Matthew: “Ye have heard that it
was said by the ancients, Thou shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be guilty of the
judgment. But I say unto you, That every one who is angry with his brother without cause

<p>10. That we must trust in God only, and in Him we must glory.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah: “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the strong man glory
in his strength, nor let the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in this,
that he understands and knows that I am the Lord, who do mercy, and judgment, and
righteousness upon the earth, because in them is my pleasure, saith the Lord.”4232 Of the
same thing in the fifty-fourth Psalm: “In the Lord have I hoped; I will not fear what man
can do unto me.”4233 Also in the same place: “To none but God alone is my soul subjected.”
4234 Also in the cxviith Psalm: “I will not fear what man can do unto me; the Lord is
my helper.”4235 Also in the same place: “It is good to trust in the Lord rather than to trust
in man; it is good to hope in the Lord rather than to hope in princes.”4236 Of this same thing
in Daniel: “But Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to king Nebuchadnezzar,
O king, there is no need to answer thee concerning this word. For God, whom we
serve, is able to deliver us from the furnace of burning fire; and He will deliver us from thine
hand, O king. And if not, be it known unto thee that we serve not thy gods, and we adore
not the golden image which thou hast set up.”4237 Likewise in Jeremiah: “Cursed is the man
who hath hope in man; and blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and his hope shall
be in God.”4238 Concerning this same thing in Deuteronomy: “Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”4239 Of this same thing to the Romans: “And they
worshipped and served the creature, forsaking the Creator. Wherefore also God gave them
up to ignominious passions.”4240 Of this thing also in John: “Greater is He who is in you

<p>11. That he who has attained to trust, having put off the former man, ought to regard only
celestial and spiritual things, and to give no heed to the world which he has already renounced.</p>
<p>In Isaiah: “Seek ye the Lord; and when ye have found Him, call upon Him. But when
He hath come near unto you, let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts: and let him be turned unto the Lord, and he shall obtain mercy, because He will
plentifully pardon your sins.”4242 Of this same thing in Solomon: “I have seen all the works
which are done under the sun; and, lo, all are vanity.”4243 Of this same thing in Exodus:
“But thus shall ye eat it; your loins girt, and your shoes on your feet, and your staves in your
hands: and ye shall eat it in haste, for it is the Lord’s passover.”4244 Of this same thing in
the Gospel according to Matthew: “Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What
shall we drink? or, Wherewith shall we be clothed? for these things the nations seek after.
But your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. Seek first the kingdom of
God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”4245 Likewise in
the same place: “Think not for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for itself.
Sufficient unto the day is its own evil.”4246 Likewise in the same place: “No one looking
back, and putting his hands to the plough, is fit for the kingdom of God.”4247 Also in the
same place: “Behold the fowls of the heaven: for they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into
barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of more value than they?”4248
Concerning this same thing, according to Luke: “Let your loins be girded, and your lamps
burning; and ye like unto men that wait for their lord, when he cometh from the wedding;
that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him. Blessed are those servants,
whom their lord, when he cometh, shall find watching.”4249 Of this same thing in Matthew:
“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man hath not
where He may lay His head.”4250 Also in the same place: “Whoso forsaketh not all that he
hath, cannot be my disciple.”4251 Of this same thing in the first to the Corinthians: “Ye are

they who possess as they who possess not, and they who use this world as they that use it
not; for the fashion of this world passeth away.”4253 Also in the same place: “The first man
is of the clay of the earth, the second man from heaven. As he is of the clay, such also are
they who are of the clay; and as is the heavenly, such also are the heavenly. Even as we have
borne the image of him who is of the clay, let us bear His image also who is from heaven.”4254
Of this same matter to the Philippians: “All seek their own, and not those things which are
Christ’s; whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and their glory is to their confusion,
who mind earthly things. For our conversation is in heaven, whence also we expect
the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall transform the body of our humiliation conformed
to the body of His glory.”4255 Of this very matter to Galatians: “But be it far from
me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified
unto me, and I unto the world.”4256 Concerning this same thing to Timothy: “No man that
warreth for God bindeth himself with worldly annoyances, that he may please Him to whom
he hath approved himself. But and if a man should contend, he will not be crowned unless
he fight lawfully.”4257 Of this same thing to the Colossians: “If ye be dead with Christ from
the elements of the world, why still, as if living in the world, do ye follow vain things?”4258
Also concerning this same thing: “If ye have risen together with Christ, seek those things
which are above, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God. Give heed to the things
that are above, not to those things which are on the earth; for ye are dead, and your life is
hidden with Christ in God. But when Christ your life shall appear, then shall ye also appear
with Him in glory.”4259 Of this same thing to the Ephesians: Put off the old man of the
former conversation, who is corrupted, according to the lusts of deceit. But be ye renewed
in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man, him who according to God is ordained
in righteousness, and holiness, and truth.”4260 Of this same thing in the Epistle of Peter:

“As strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; but having
a good conversation among the Gentiles, that while they detract from you as if from evildoers,
yet, beholding your good works, they may magnify God.”4261 Of this same thing in the
Epistle of John: “He who saith he abideth in Christ, ought himself also to walk even as He
walked.”4262 Also in the same place: “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the
world. If any man loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him. Because everything
which is in the world is lust of the flesh, and lust of the eyes, and the ambition of this world,
which is not of the Father, but of the lust of this world. And the world shall pass away with
its lust. But he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever, even as God abideth for ever.”4263
Also in the first Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians: “Purge out the old leaven, that ye may
be a new dough, as ye are unleavened. For also Christ our passover is sacrificed. Therefore
let us celebrate the feast, not in the old leaven, nor in the leaven of malice and wickedness,
but in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.”4264</p>

<p>12. That we must not swear.</p>
<p>In Solomon: “A man that sweareth much shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague
shall not depart from his house; and if he swear vainly, he shall not be justified.”4265 Of this
same matter, according to Matthew: “(Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old,
Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths.) I say unto you,
Swear not at all: (neither by heaven, because it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, because it
is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King; neither shalt thou
swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.) But let your discourse
be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: (for whatever is fuller than these is of evil.”)4266 Of this same
thing in Exodus: “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.”4267</p>

thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they speak no guile.”4269 Of this same thing in
Leviticus: “And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Bring forth him who hath cursed abroad
outside the camp; and all who heard him shall place their hands upon his head, and all the
assembly of the children of Israel shall stone him.”4270 Of this same thing in Paul’s Epistle
to the Ephesians: “Let no evil discourse proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good
for the edification of faith, that it may give grace to the hearers.”4271 Of this same thing to
the Romans: “Blessing, and not cursing.”4272 Of this same thing in the Gospel according to
Matthew: “He who shall say to his brother, Thou fool! shall be liable to the Gehenna of
fire.”4273 Of this same matter, according to the same Matthew: “But I say unto you, That
every idle word which men shall speak, they shall give account for it in the day of judgment.

speakest as one of the foolish women. If we have received good things from the Lord’s hand,
why shall we not endure evil things? In all these things which happened unto him, Job sinned
not with his lips in the sight of the Lord.”4275 Also in the same place: “Hast thou regarded
my servant Job? for there is none like unto him in the earth: a man without complaint: a
true worshipper of God, restraining himself from all evil.”4276 Of the same thing in the
thirty-third Psalm: “I will bless the Lord at all times: His praise shall ever be in my
mouth.”4277 Of this same thing in Numbers: “Let their murmuring cease from me, and they
shall not die.”4278 Of this same thing in the Acts of the Apostles: “But about the middle of

<p>In Genesis: “And God, tempted Abraham, and said to him, Take thy only son whom
thou lovest, Isaac, and go into the high land, and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one
of the mountains of which I will tell thee.”4282 Of this same thing in Deuteronomy: “The
Lord your God proveth you, that He may know if ye love the Lord your God with all your
heart, and with all your soul.”4283 Of this same thing in the Wisdom of Solomon: “Although
in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality; and having been
in few things distressed, yet in many things they shall be happily ordered, because God tried
them, and found them worthy of Himself. As gold in the furnace He proved them, and as
a burnt-offering He received them. And in their time there shall be respect of them; they
shall judge the nations, and shall rule over the people; and their Lord shall reign for ever.”4284

<p>16. Of the benefits of martyrdom.</p>
<p>In the Proverbs of Solomon: “The faithful martyr delivers his soul from evils.”4286 Also
in the same place: “Then shall the righteous stand in great boldness against them who have
afflicted them, and who took away their labours. When they see them, they shall be disturbed
with a horrible fear; and they shall wonder at the suddenness of their unhoped-for salvation,
saying among themselves, repenting and groaning with distress of spirit, These are they
whom some time we had in derision, and in the likeness of a proverb; we fools counted their
life madness, and their end without honour. How are they reckoned among the children of
God, and their lot among the saints! Therefore we have wandered from the way of truth,
and the light of righteousness has not shined upon us, and the sun has not risen upon us.
We have been wearied in the way of iniquity and of perdition, and we have walked through
difficult solitudes; but we have not known the way of the Lord. What hath pride profited
us? or what hath the boasting of riches brought to us? All these things have passed away as
a shadow.”4287 Of this same thing in the cxvth Psalm: “Precious in the sight of the Lord is
the death of His saints.”4288 Also in the cxxvth Psalm: “They who sow in tears shall reap in
joy. Walking they walked, and wept as they cast their seeds; but coming they shall come in
joy, raising up their laps.”4289 Of this same thing in the Gospel according to John: “He who
loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall find it to life eternal.”
4290 Also in the same place: “But when they shall deliver you up, take no thought what
ye shall speak; for it is not ye who speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in
you.”4291 Also in the same place: “The hour shall come, that every one that killeth you shall
think he doeth service to God; but they shall do this also because they have not known the
Father nor me.”4292 Of this same matter, according to Matthew: “Blessed are they which
shall suffer persecution for righteousness’ sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”4293
Also in the same place: “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul;
but rather fear Him which is able to kill the soul and body in Gehenna.”4294 Also in the
same place: “Whosoever shall confess me before men, him also will I confess before my
Father which is in heaven; but he who shall deny me before men, him also will I deny before

you, and shall separate you (from their company), and shall drive you out, and shall speak
evil of your name, as wicked, for the Son of man’s sake. Rejoice in that day, and exult; for,
lo, your reward is great in heaven.”4296 Also in the same place: “Verily I say unto you, There
is no man that leaveth house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the sake of
the kingdom of God, and does not receive seven times as much in this present time, but in
the world to come life everlasting.”4297 Of this same thing in the Apocalypse: “And when
he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar of God the souls of them that were slain
on account of the word of God and His testimony. And they cried with a loud voice, saying,
How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that
dwell on the earth? And unto every one of them were given white robes; and it was said to
them, that they should rest still for a short time, until the number of their fellow-servants,
and of their brethren, should be fulfilled, and they who shall afterwards be slain, after their
example.”4298 Also in the same place: “After these things I saw a great crowd, which no one
among them could number, from every nation, and from every tribe, and from every people
and tongue, standing before the throne and before the Lamb; and they were clothed with
white robes, and palms were in their hands. And they said with a loud voice, Salvation to
our God, that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb. And one of the elders answered and
said to me, What are these which are clothed with white robes? who are they, and whence
have they come? And I said unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said unto me, These
are they who have come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve
Him day and night in His temple; and He who sitteth upon the throne shall dwell among
them. They shall neither hunger nor thirst ever; and neither shall the sun fall upon them,
nor shall they suffer any heat: for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall protect
them, and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of life; and God shall wipe away
every tear from their eyes.”4299 Also in the same place: “He who shall overcome I will give
him to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.”4300 Also in the same place:
“Be thou faithful even unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”4301 Also in the same

good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. There now remains for me a
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me in that day; and
not only to me, but to all also who love His appearing.”4303 Of this same thing to the Romans:
“We are the sons of God: but if sons and heirs of God, we are also joint-heirs with Christ;
if we suffer together, that we may also be magnified together.”4304 Of this same thing in the

of comparison with the glory that is to come after, which shall be revealed in us.”4306 Of
this same thing in the Maccabees: “O Lord, who hast the holy knowledge, it is manifest that
while I might be delivered from death, I am suffering most cruel pains of body, being beaten
with whips; yet in spirit I suffer these things willingly, because of the fear of thine own
self.”4307 Also in the same place: “Thou indeed, being powerless, destroyest us out of this
present life; but the King of the world shall raise us up who have died for His laws into the
eternal resurrection of life.”4308 Also in the same place: “It is better that, given up to death
by men, we should expect hope from God to be raised again by Him. For there shall be no
resurrection to life for thee.”4309 Also in the same place: “Having power among men, although
thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt. But think not that our race is forsaken of
God. Sustain, and see how His great power will torment thee and thy seed.”4310 Also in the
same place: Do not err without cause; for we suffer these things on our own accounts, as
sinners against our God. But think not thou that thou shalt be unpunished, having undertaken

father or mother above me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter above
me, is not worthy of me; and he that taketh not up his cross and followeth me, is not my
disciple.”4313 Also in the Epistle of Paul to the Romans: “Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
peril, or sword? As it is written, Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are

kingdom of heaven; but he who doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven, he shall
enter into the kingdom of heaven.”4318 Also according to Luke: “But that servant which

thing in the Wisdom of Solomon: “The beginning of wisdom is to fear God.”4322 Also in
the Proverbs of the same: “Blessed is the man who reverences all things with fear.”4323 Of
the same thing in Isaiah: “And upon whom else will I look, except upon him that is lowly
and peaceful, and that trembleth at my words?”4324 Of this same thing in Genesis: “And
the angel of the Lord called him from heaven, and said unto him, Abraham, Abraham: and
he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do anything unto
him: for now I know that thou fearest thy God, and hast not spared thy beloved son for my
sake.”4325 Also in the second Psalm: “Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice unto Him in trembling.”
4326 Also in Deuteronomy, the word of God to Moses: “Call the people together to
me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they
themselves shall live upon the earth.”4327 Also in Jeremiah: “Behold, the days come, saith
the Lord, that I will perfect upon the house of Israel, and in the house of Judah, a new covenant:
not according to the covenant that I had ordered with their fathers in the day when
I laid hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; because they have not abode
in my covenant, and I have been unmindful of them, saith the Lord; because this is the
covenant which I will ordain for the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will
give my law, and will write it in their mind and I will be to them for a God, and they shall
be to me for a people. And they shall not teach every man his brother, saying, Know the
Lord: because all shall know me, from the least even to the greatest of them: because I will
be favourable to their iniquities, and their sins I will not remember any more. If the heaven
should be lifted up on high, saith the Lord, and if the earth should be made low from beneath,
yet I will not cast away the people of Israel, saith the Lord, for all the things which they have
done. Behold, I will gather them together from every land in which I have scattered them
in anger, and in my fury, and in great indignation; and I will grind them down into that
place, and I will leave them in fear; and they shall be to me for a people, and I will be to them
for a God: and I will give them another way, and another heart, that they may fear me all
their days in prosperity with their children: and I will perfect for them an everlasting coven-

“And the four and twenty elders which sit on their thrones in the sight (of God), fell upon
their faces, and worshipped God, saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God omnipotent,
which art and which wast; because Thou hast taken Thy great power, and hast reigned. And
the nations were angry, and Thy wrath is come, and the time in which it should be judged
concerning the dead, and the reward should be given to Thy servants the prophets, and the
saints that fear Thy name, small and great; and to disperse those who have corrupted the
earth.”4329 Also in the same place: “And I saw another angel flying through the midst of
the heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach to those who dwell upon the earth, and
to all the nations, and tribes, and tongues, and peoples, saying with a loud voice, Fear God,
and give Him honour, because the hour of His judgment is come; and adore Him who made
the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”4330 Also in the same
place: “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and the beasts were feeding with
His lambs;4331 and the number of His name a hundred and forty and four, standing upon
the sea of glass, having the harps of God; and they sing the song of Moses, the servant of
God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are Thy works, O Lord God
Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of the nations. Who would not fear Thee,
and give honour to Thy name? for Thou only art holy: and because all nations shall come
and worship in Thy sight, because Thy righteousnesses have been made manifest.”4332 Also

wife by name Susanna, the daughter of Helchias, a very beautiful woman, and one that feared
the Lord. And her parents were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law
of Moses.”4333 Moreover, in Daniel: “And we are lowly this day in all the earth because of
our sins, and there is not at this time any prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt-offering,
or oblation, or sacrifice, or incense, or place to sacrifice before Thee, and to find mercy from
Thee. And yet in the soul and spirit of lowliness let us be accepted as the burnt-offerings of
rams and bulls, and as it were many thousands of lambs which are fattest. If our offering

“And the king exceedingly rejoiced, and commanded Daniel to be taken up out of the den
of lions; and the lions had done him no hurt, because he trusted and had believed in his
God. And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel; and
they cast them in the den of lions, and their wives and their children. And before they had
reached the pavement of the den they were seized by the lions, and they brake all their bones
in pieces. Then Darius the king wrote, To all peoples, tribes, and languages which are in
my kingdom, peace be unto you from my face. I decree and ordain that all those who are
in my kingdom shall fear and tremble before the most high God whom Daniel serves, because
He is the God who liveth and abideth for ever, and His kingdom shall not pass away, and
His dominion goeth on for ever; and He alone doeth signs, and prodigies, and marvellous
things in the heaven and the earth, who snatched Daniel from the den of lions.”4335 Also
in Micah: “Wherewith shall I approach the Lord, and lay hold upon Him? in sacrifices, in
burnt-offerings, in calves of a year old? Does the Lord favour and receive me with thousands
of fat goats? or shall I give my first-fruits of unrighteousness, the fruit of my belly, the sin
of my soul? It is told thee, O man, what is good; or what else the Lord doth require, save
that thou shouldst do judgment and justice, and love mercy, and be ready to go with the
Lord thy God. The voice of the Lord shall be invoked in the city, and He will save those who
fear His name.”4336 Also in Micah: “Feed Thy people with Thy rod, the sheep of Thine inheritance;
and pluck up those who dwell separately in the midst of Carmel. They shall prepare
Bashan and Gilead according to the days of the age; and according to the days of their going
forth from the land of Egypt I will show them wonderful things. The nations shall see, and
be confounded at all their might; and they shall place their hand upon their mouth. Their
ears shall be deafened, and they shall lick the dust as do serpents. Dragging the earth, they
shall be disturbed, and they shall lick the dust: in their end they shall be afraid towards the

who dwell therein. From the face of His anger who shall bear it, and who withstandeth in

down, and cast into the fire.”4359 Also in the same place: “Many shall say unto me in that

ye were of the world, the world would love what would be its own: but because ye are not
of the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember
the word which I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they
have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.”4370 Also in Baruch:4371 “For the time
shall come, and ye shall seek me, both ye and those who shall be after you, to hear the word
of wisdom and of understanding; and ye shall not find me. But the nations shall desire to
see the wise man, and it shall not happen to them; not because the wisdom of this world
shall be wanting, or shall fail to the earth; but neither shall the word of the law be wanting
to the world. For wisdom shall be in a few who watch, and are silent and quiet, and who
hold converse with one another; because some shall dread them, and shall fear them as evil.
But some do not believe the word of the law of the Highest. But some who are amazed in
their countenance will not believe; and they also who contradict will believe, and will be
contrary to and hindering the spirit of truth. Moreover, others will be wise to the spirit of
error, and declaring the edicts, as if of the Highest and the Strong One. Moreover, others

thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it: because the Lord thy God inquiring shall seek it of

lips, and shalt perform the gift which thou hast spoken with thy mouth.”4374 Of this same
matter in the forty-ninth Psalm: “Sacrifice to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows
to the Most High. Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me.”4375 Of this same thing in the Acts of the Apostles: “Why hath Satan filled thine

<p>In Genesis: “Multiplying I will multiply thy sorrows and thy groanings, and in sorrow
shalt thou bring forth children; and thy turning shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule
over thee.”4382 Of this same thing in the Gospel according to Matthew: “All men do not
receive the word, but they to whom it is given: for there are some eunuchs who were born
so from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who have been constrained by men,
and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s
sake. He who can receive it, let him receive it.”4383 Also according to Luke: “The children
of this world beget, and are begotten. But they who have been considered worthy of that
world, and the resurrection from the dead, do not marry, nor are married: for neither shall
they begin to die: for they are equal to the angels of God, since they are the children of the
resurrection. But, that the dead rise again, Moses intimates when he says in the bush, The
Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. He is not the God
of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto Him.”4384 Also in the first Epistle of Paul to
the Corinthians: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman. But, on account of fornication,
let every man have his own wife, and every woman have her own husband. Let the husband
render what is due to the wife, and similarly the wife to the husband. The wife hath not
power over her own body, but the husband. And in like manner, the husband hath not
power over his own body, but the wife. Defraud not one the other, except by agreement for
a time, that ye may have leisure for prayer; and again return to the same point, lest Satan
tempt you on account of your incontinency. This I say by way of allowance, not by way of
command. But I wish that all men should be even as I am. But every one has his proper gift
from God; one in one way, but another in another way.”4385 Also in the same place: “An
unmarried man thinks of those things which are the Lord’s, in what way he may please God;
but he who has contracted marriage thinks of those things that are of this world, in what
way he may please his wife. Thus also, both the woman and the unmarried virgin thinketh
of those things which are the Lord’s, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but
she that hath married thinks of those things which are of this world, in what way she may
please her husband.”4386 Also in Exodus, when the Lord had commanded Moses that he
should sanctify the people for the third day, he sanctified them, and added: “Be ye ready,

Of this same thing, that one ought to separate himself from the Gentiles, lest he should be
a companion of their sin, and become a partaker of their penalty, in the Apocalypse: “And
I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Go forth from her, my people, lest thou be partaker
of her crimes, and lest thou be stricken with her plagues; because her crimes have
reached even to heaven, and the Lord God hath remembered her iniquities. Therefore He
hath returned unto her double, and in the cup which she hath mixed double is mingled for
her; and in how much she hath glorified herself and possessed of delights, in so much is
given unto her both torment and grief. For in her heart she says, I am a queen, and cannot
be a widow, nor shall I see sorrow. Therefore in one hour her plagues shall come on her,
death, grief, and famine; and she shall be burned with fire, because the Lord God is strong
who shall judge her. And the kings of the earth shall weep and lament themselves for her,
who have committed fornication with her, and have been conversant in her sins.”4394 Also

women professing chastity, with a good conversation.”4399 Of this same thing in the Epistle

who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, threatened not, but gave
Himself up to him that judgeth unrighteously.”4405 Also Paul to the Philippians: “Who,
being appointed in the figure of God, thought it not robbery that He was equal with God;
but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, He was made in the likeness of man, and
was found in fashion as a man. He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death,
and the death of the cross. For which cause also God hath exalted Him, and hath given Him
a name, that it may be above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should be
bowed, of things heavenly, and earthly, and infernal; and that every tongue should confess
that the Lord Jesus Christ is in glory of God the Father.”4406 Of this same thing in the Gospel
according to John: “If I have washed your feet, being your Master and Lord, ye also ought
to wash the feet of others. For I have given you an example, that as I have done, ye also
should do to others.”4407</p>

the saints shall judge this world?”4420 And again: “Now indeed there is altogether a fault
among you, because ye have judgments one against another. Wherefore do ye not rather
suffer injury? or wherefore are ye not rather defrauded? But ye do wrong, and defraud, and
this your brethren. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not obtain the kingdom of

“Let a woman learn with silence, in all subjection. But I permit not a woman to teach, nor
to be set over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve; and Adam

the Lord against the inhabitants of the earth, because there is neither mercy nor truth, nor
acknowledgment of God upon the earth; but cursing, and lying, and slaughter, and theft,
and adultery is scattered abroad upon the earth: they mingle blood to blood. Therefore the
land shall mourn, with all its inhabitants, with the beasts of the field, with the creeping things
of the earth, with the birds of heaven; and the fishes of the sea shall fail: so that no man may
judge, no man may refute.”4426 Of this same thing in Isaiah: “Is not the Lord’s hand strong
to save, or has He weighed down His ear that He may not hear? But your sins separate
between you and God; and on account of your iniquities He turns away His face from you,
lest He should pity. For your hands are polluted with blood, and your fingers with sins; and
your lips have spoken wickedness, and your tongue devises unrighteousness. No one speaks
true things, neither is judgment true. They trust in vanity, and speak emptiness, who conceive
sorrow, and bring forth wickedness.”4427 Also in Zephaniah: “In failing, let it fail from the
face of the earth, saith the Lord. Let man fail, and cattle; let the birds of heaven fail, and the
fishes of the sea; and I will take away the unrighteous from the face of the earth.”4428</p>

and shall return the pledge of the debtor, and shall not commit rapine, and shall give his
bread to the hungry, and shall cover the naked, and shall not give his money for usury.”4431

to him when he cometh from the field, Pass forward and recline? But he says to him, Make
ready somewhat that I may sup, and gird thyself, and minister to me, until I eat and drink;
and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink? Does he thank that servant because he has done

<p>In the first Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians: “We see now through the glass in an enigma,
but then with face to face. Now I know partly; but then I shall know even as also I am
known.”4444 Also in Solomon, in Wisdom: “And in simplicity of heart seek Him.”4445 Also
in the same: “He who walketh with simplicity, walketh trustfully.”4446 Also in the same:
“Seek not things higher than thyself, and look not into things stronger than thyself.”4447
Also in Solomon: “Be not excessively righteous, and do not reason more than is required.”
4448 Also in Isaiah: “Woe unto them who are convicted in themselves.”4449 Also
in the Maccabees: “Daniel in his simplicity was delivered from the mouth of the lions.”4450
Also in the Epistle of Paul to the Romans: “Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and
knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are His judgments, and how unsearchable are
His ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been His counsellor? or
who has first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? Because from Him,
and through Him, and in Him, are all things: to Him be glory for ever and ever.”4451 Also

thy wife, and hast eaten of that tree of which alone I commanded thee that thou shouldest
not eat, cursed shall be the ground in all thy works; in sadness and groaning shalt thou eat
of it all the days of thy life: thorns and thistles shall it cast forth to thee; and thou shalt eat
the herb of the field in the sweat of thy brow. Thou shalt eat thy bread until thou return
unto the earth from which also thou wast taken; because earth thou art, and to earth thou
shalt go.”4468 Also in the same place: “And Enoch pleased God, and was not found afterwards:
because God translated him.”4469 And in Isaiah: “All flesh is grass, and all the glory of it as
the flower of grass. The grass withered, and the flower hath fallen away; but the word of the
Lord abideth for ever.”4470 In Ezekiel: “They say, Our bones are become dry, our hope hath
perished: we have expired. Therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I open
your monuments, and I will bring you forth from your monuments, and I will bring you
into the land of Israel; and I will put my Spirit upon you, and ye shall live; and I will place
you into your land: and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and will do it, saith the

<p>59. Of the idols which the Gentiles think to be gods.</p>
<p>In the Wisdom of Solomon: “All the idols of the nations they counted gods, which
neither have the use of their eyes for seeing, nor their nostrils to receive breath, nor their
ears for hearing, nor the fingers on their hands for handling; but their feet also are slow to
walk. For man made them; and he who has borrowed his breath, he fashioned them. But
no man will be able to fashion a god like to himself. For since he is mortal, he fashioneth a
dead thing with wicked hands. But he himself is better than they whom he worships, since
he indeed lived, but they never.”4482 On this same matter: “Neither have they who have
regarded the works known who was the artificer, but have thought that either fire, or wind,
or the rapid air, or the circle of the stars, or the abundant water, or the sun and moon, were
the gods that rule over the world; and if, on account of the beauty of these, they have thought
thus, let them know how much more beautiful than these is the Lord; or if they have admired
their powers and operations, let them perceive from these very things that He who has established
these mighty things is stronger than they.”4483 Also in the cxxxivth Psalm: “The
idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. They have a mouth, and
speak not; they have eyes, and see not; they have ears, and hear not; and neither is there any
breath in their mouth. Let them who make them become like unto them, and all those who
trust in them.”4484 Also in the ninety-fifth Psalm: “All the gods of the nations are demons,
but the Lord made the heavens.”4485 Also in Exodus: “Ye shall not make unto yourselves
gods of silver nor of gold.”4486 And again: “Thou shalt not make to thyself an idol, nor the
likeness of any thing.”4487 Also in Jeremiah: “Thus saith the Lord, Walk not according to
the ways of the heathen; for they fear those things in their own persons, because the lawful
things of the heathen are vain. Wood cut out from the forest is made the work of the carpenter,
and melted silver and gold are beautifully arranged: they strengthen them with
hammers and nails, and they shall not be moved, for they are fixed. The silver is brought
from Tharsis, the gold comes from Moab. All things are the works of the artificers; they will
clothe it with blue and purple; lifting them, they will carry them, because they will not go
forward. Be not afraid of them, because they do no evil, neither is there good in them. Say
thus, The gods that have not made the heaven and the earth perish from the earth, and from

In Isaiah: “The dragon hath fallen or is dissolved; their carved works have become as beasts

be saved from war; but they themselves have been led captive with thee.”4490 And again:
“To whom have ye likened me? See and understand that ye err in your heart, who lavish
gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, bringing it up to the weight. The
workmen have made with their hand the things made; and, bowing themselves, they have
adored it, and have raised it on their shoulders: and thus they walked. But if they should
place them down, they will abide in their place, and will not be moved; and they will not
hear those who cry unto them: they will not save them from evils.”4491 Also in Jeremiah:
“The Lord, who made heaven and earth, in strength hath ordered the world, in His wisdom

these plagues, nor repented of the works of the deeds of their hands, that they should not

Will ye dwell alone upon the earth?”4503 Also in Zephaniah: “They shall build houses,

“For what does it profit a man to make a gain of the whole world, but that he should lose
himself?”4505 And again: “But the Lord said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul is required

“Remember that thou hast received thy good things in this life, and likewise Lazarus evil

Peter said unto him, Silver and gold indeed I have not; but what I have I give unto you: In
the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And, taking hold of his right hand,
he lifted him up.”4508 Also in the first to Timothy: “We brought nothing into this world,
but neither can we take anything away. Therefore, having maintenance and clothing, let us
with these be content. But they who will become rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
many and hurtful lusts, which drown man in perdition and destruction. For the root of all

the Jews were laid waste, unless they forsook their foreign wives, with the children also
whom they had begotten of them. Also in the first Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians: “The
woman is bound so long as her husband liveth; but if he die, she is freed to marry whom
she will, only in the Lord. But she will be happier if she abide thus.”4511 And again: “Know

make them the members of an harlot? Far be it from me. Or know ye not that he who is
joined together with an harlot is one body? for two shall be in one flesh. But he who is joined

ye wish. But the deeds of the flesh are manifest, which are: adulteries, fornications, impurities,

hatreds, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: with

of discourse, lest the cross of Christ should become of no effect. For the word of the cross
is foolishness to those who perish; but to those who are saved it is the power of God. For it
is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will reprove the prudence of the
prudent. Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? Hath
not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? Since indeed, in the wisdom of God, the
world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them
that believe. Because the Jews desire signs, and the Greeks seek for wisdom: but we preach
Christ crucified, to the Jews indeed a stumbling-block, and to the Gentiles foolishness; but
to them that are called, Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of
God.”4526 And again: “Let no man deceive himself. If any man think that he is wise among
you, let him become a fool to this world, that he may be wise. For the wisdom of this world
is foolishness with God. For it is written, Thou shalt rebuke the wise in their own craftiness.”

<head>Elucidations.</head>

<p>I.
(On the unity of the Church, p. 421.)</p>
<p>The epistles have already been elucidated as the best exposition of this treatise. Little
need be added. But, to illustrate the bearings of this treatise upon the history of Christian
unity, we need only refer to the manner in which the subject was treated as soon as the
papacy was created by Nicholas I. Thus, he astounded the Greeks by his consummate audacity
(a.d. 860) in the matter of the disputed succession in Constantinople.4637 “It is our will,” he
says, “that Ignatius should appear before our envoys,” etc. He declares it the rule of the
Fathers, that, “without the consent of the Roman See and the Roman pontiff, nothing should
be decided.” Also, he affirms, “The Creator of all things has established the Princedom of
the Divine Power, which He granted to His chosen apostles. He has firmly established it on
the firm faith of the Prince of the Apostles,—that is to say, Peter,—to whom he pre-eminently
granted the first See,” etc. He was now speaking on the strength of the forged Decretals, to
which he appeals, and which he succeeded in making law for the West. He thus created the
lasting schism with the Easterns, who had never heard the like before his time.</p>
<p>Obviously, therefore, had Cyprian entertained such ideas, his treatise could never have
been written; for it is a masterly exposition of a curious point, viz., the fact that (1) the
Apostle Peter received the first grant alone, and yet (2) all the apostles received precisely
the same; while (1) Peter had thus a primacy of honour, but (2) in no respect any power or
authority over his brethren. On these admitted facts he constructs his theory of unity, expounding
by it the actual state of the Church’s constitution. Peter’s memory he honours,
but without any less reverence for all the apostolic Sees, which over and over again he
maintains to be of equal authority and sanctity. That the Church was founded on Stephen
any more than on the Bishop of Carthage, he never imagines; for it is one thing to allow
that a bishop has succeeded an apostle at the place of his last labours, and quite another to
assume that therefore such a bishop is virtually the apostle himself. Yet this assumption is
the ground of all Roman doctrine on this point.4638</p>
<p>Had such been Cyprian’s idea, his Treatise on Unity must have proceeded thus: (1) “Our
Lord said to Peter only, I will give unto thee the keys; (2) to the rest of the apostles He gave

<note type="footnote">4638 “Whatever is said in commendation of St. Peter is at once transferred to the occupant of the papacy, as
if pasce oves meas had been said to Pius IX.” Burgon, Letters from Rome, p. 411, ed. 1862.</note>

<pb n="1377"/>
only an inferior and subject authority; (3) to the successor of Peter, therefore, at Rome, all
other bishops and churches must be subject; for (4) in this subjection the law of unity consists;
and (5) if even all the other apostles were alive to this day, they would be subject to Stephen,
as Prince of the Apostles, or would be rebels against Christ.”</p>
<p>Compare this treatise of Cyprian, then, with any authorized treatise on the subject
proceeding from modern Rome, and it will be seen that the two systems are irreconcilable.
Thus, in few words, says the Confession4639 of Pius IV.: “I acknowledge the Holy Catholic
Apostolic Roman Church for the mother and mistress of all churches; and I promise true
obedience to the Bishop of Rome, successor to St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar
of Jesus Christ.” This is the voice of Italy in the ninth century; but Cyprian speaks for
OEcumenical Christendom in the third, and the two systems are as contrary as darkness and
light.</p>

<p>II.
(Falsifying of the text, p. 422.)</p>
<p>Cyprian is often innocently quoted by Romanist controvertists against the very principles
of Cyprian himself, of his life and his writings. This is due to the fact that they have in their
hands vitiated and interpolated copies. Thus, take a famous passage as follows:—
<lg>
<l>Cyprian.</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Loquitur Dominus ad Petrum, Ego tibi dico Tu es Petrus, etc.(a)</p>
<p>Super unum(b) ædificat ecclesiam.</p>
<p>Hoc erant utique et cæteri apostoli quot fuit Petrus, qui consortio præditi et honoris et
potestatis, sed exordium ab unitate proficisitur,(c) ut(d) Christi ecclesia(e) una monstretur.(f)</p>
<p>Qui Ecclesiæ resistitur et resistit,(g) in ecclesia se esse confidit?</p>
<p>Interpolated.</p>
<p>(a) Et iterum eidem, post ressurectionem suam dicit, Pasce oves meas.</p>
<p>(b) Super illum unum…et illi pascendas mandat oves suas.</p>
<p>(c) Et primatus Petro datur.</p>
<p>(d) Una.</p>
<p>(e) Et cathedra.</p>
<p>(f) Et pastores sunt omnes et grex unus ostenditur, qui ab apostolis omnibus, unanimi
consensione pascatur, etc.</p>
<p>(g) Qui cathedram Petri, super quem fundata est ecclesia deserit, etc.</p>
<note type="footnote">4639 Compendium Ritualis Romani, etc., Baltimori, 1842, p. 195.</note>

<pb n="1378"/>
<p>This is but a specimen of the way in which Cyprian has been “doctored,” in order to
bring him into a shape capable of being misinterpreted. But you will say where is the proof
of such interpolations? The greatly celebrated Benedictine edition reads as the interpolated
column does, and who would not credit Baluzius? Now note, Baluzius rejected these interpolations
and others; but, dying (a.d. 1718) with his work unfinished, the completion of the
task was assigned to a nameless monk, who confesses that he corrupted the work of Baluzius,
or rather glories in the exploit.4640 “Nay, further,” he says, “it was necessary to alter not a
few things in the notes of Baluzius; and more would have been altered if it could have been
done conveniently.” Yet the edition came forth, and passes as the genuine work of the erudite
Baluzius himself.</p>
<p>An edition of this treatise, with valuable annotations, appeared (a.d. 1852) from the
press of Burlington, N.J., under the very creditable editorship of Professor Hyde, who was
soon after called to depart this life. It exhibits the interpolations, and gives a useful catalogue
of codices and of editions. Though its typographical execution is imperfect, I know not
where so much condensed information on the subject is to be had at so little cost.4641 I am
grateful for the real advantage I derived from it on its first appearance.</p>

<p>III.
(If ye do not forgive, etc., p. 454.)</p>
<p>The Jewish liturgies contained the petitions of the Lord’s Prayer essentially; but our divine
Lord framed this comprehensive and sublime compend, and gave it to His children for ever,
with His own seal upon it in the exceptional petition which imparts to it the impress of His
own cross and passion. In the Gospel of St. Matthew4642 we find our Master commenting
on the fifth petition in a very striking manner, as if it were the essence of the whole prayer;
and, indeed, it is so, regarded as its evangelical feature, i.e., something added to the law in
the spirit of the Atonement. As such, it surprised the apostles; and He who knew their
thoughts instantly anticipated their inquiries: “For if ye forgive men,” etc.</p>
<p>From the criticism of a very able editorial hand,4643 I feel it a privilege to insert the following
valuable comments:—</p>
<p>“The petitions of the Lord’s Prayer, as is well known, are to be found for the most part
in the Talmud and Jewish liturgies. In the latter we have frequently the phrases, ‘our Father,

our King,’ ‘our Father, Father of mercies,’ and ‘our Father that art in heaven.’ The third
petition in the Shemone esre is, ‘Let us hallow the Name in the world as it is hallowed in the
high heaven. We will hallow Thee, and Thy praise, O God, shall not leave our mouth for
ever and ever; since Thou, O God, art a great and holy King. Praised be Thou, O Lord, thou
holy God. Thou art holy, and Thy name is holy, and holy men praise Thee everlastingly
every day.’ The ineffable name of God represented all His attributes, and is consequently
frequently substituted for Him. The end of the first petition in the Kaddish prayer runs
thus: ‘May He extend His kingdom in your days, and in those of the whole house of Israel
very soon.’ In Berakhoth (29 b) we have, ‘What is a short prayer? Rabbi Eliezer said, “Thy
will be done in heaven, and peace of heart be unto those who fear Thee on earth.”’ The same
tract gives another prayer: ‘The needs of Thy people Israel are many, but its discernment is
small. Do Thou, O everlasting One, our God, give to each man what he needs for his support,
and what his body wants; but do what seemeth Thee good.’ In the Mekhilta we read that
Rabbi Eliezer of Modin, near Jerusalem, said: ‘Whosoever has enough for the day to eat,
and says, What shall I eat to-morrow? is of little faith.’ This passage seems to illustrate the
meaning of the Greek ἐπιούσιον. The third petition in the Shemone esre runs: ‘Forgive us,
O our Father, for we have sinned; forgive us, O our King, for we have transgressed: since
Thou art He that forgiveth and pardoneth.’ In reference to this the Midrash Shemoth (par.
31) states, ‘There is no creature who does not owe thanks to the Lord; but He is pitiful and
long-suffering, and remitteth old debts.’ The daily morning prayer of the Jews contains this
petition: ‘Lead us not into the power of sin, of transgression and crime, of temptation and
shame. Let not passion have dominion over us, and keep us far from wicked men and evil
company.’ In one of the prayers composed in Aramaic for the rabbis and leading men of
the Jewish community, the passage occurs, ‘Defend and deliver them from all evil, and from
all evil hap,’ which may be compared with the petition, ‘Deliver us from evil.’ The Doxology
at the end of the Lord’s Prayer has equally Jewish parallels. Thus, one of the daily evening
prayers concludes with the words, ‘For Thine is the kingdom;’ i.e., God alone is ruler of the
world. The words ‘the power and the glory’ seem to come from 1 Chron. xxix. 11, which is
quoted in the Talmud; and the Mishna Berakhoth (ix. 5) states, ‘In the temple all blessings
did not end with “Amen,” but with the words “for ever and ever.”’ When the heretics multiplied,
however, there was only one world; so the concluding formula became ‘from everlasting
to everlasting.’”</p>

<p>IV.
(Lift up your hearts, p. 455.)</p>
<p>It is demonstrated by Sir William Palmer that the Sursum Corda is of a date to which
no history runneth contrary, and is to be found in all the primitive liturgies of whatever

<pb n="1380"/>
family. For a very early example of its use, I must refer to the Alexandrian liturgy cited by
Bunsen;4644 and, in short, I beg to refer the reader to all the resources of the fourth volume
of his Hippolytus. Little as I can approve of the magisterial air with which Dr. Bunsen under-
takes to decide all questions, and little as I sympathize with his abnormal religion, which
seems to coincide with that of no existing church or sect in the world, I feel grateful for his
industry in collecting materials, and am always interested in the ingenuity with which he
works them into his theories. Although he possesses some touchstone unknown to the rest
of mankind, by which he reaches and utters pontifical decisions as to what is genuine and
what is corrupt, I must record my doubts as to many of his facts, and my dissent from most
of his inferences. But, unwilling to refer to Anglican authorities on points so much disputed,
I cordially turn to the learned Chevalier, and to the treasures he has collected. See the Greek
forms on p. 335 of his fourth volume, followed by the preface on p. 336, and the Tersanctus
on p. 337: ῝Αγιος, ἅγιος, ἅγιος, κύριε Σαβαώθ, κ.τ.λ</p>

<p>V.
(To pray and give thanks, p. 457.)</p>
<p>Here comes into view that reference of the apostle4645 to the usages of the primitive
assemblies: “How shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving
of thanks.” Though Cyprian omits the final Amen from his express commentary, it is to be
noted that our Lord makes it virtually part of this prayer, by His precept (John xvi. 23, 24),
to ask in His name. Now, He makes this word Amen one of His own names4646 in the
Apocalypse; throwing back a new character upon His frequent use of it, especially in St.
John’s Gospel, and giving it as a sort of appropriation of 2 Cor. i. 20, when He calls Himself
“The Amen, the faithful and true Witness.” He thus makes it infinitely dear to Christians.4647
As in the Jewish usages,4648 with which the disciples were familiar, it was a matter of course,
we may suppose they added Amen in reciting this prayer, but not with their subsequent
knowledge that it implies the merits, and claims the mediation, of the Great Intercessor.
Rev. v. 8; viii. 3, 4; St. John xvii. 8.</p>
<p>Tertullian4649 refers to the responsive “Hallelujah” as “enriched prayer,” and the Amen

<p>VI.
(Its failing estate, p. 458.)</p>
<p>Hippolytus4650 foresaw the democratic age into which the feudal era of iron should
pass, corroding in the toes by contact with the miry clay of the despised plebs, “the seed of
men.” No lasting strength was to be imparted to imperialism by the plébiscite (Dan. ii. 43);
and the prophet might almost be supposed to have the epoch of dynamite in his sight, as he
speaks of the unwillingness of the people to cleave to the effete system of empire. Now, then,
if “the failing estate” of the world was apparent in the days of Philip and Decius, how much
more in our own! Sixteen human lives span the gulf of time between us and them, for we
have many centenarians among us; and with the Lord “a thousand years are as one day.”
Compare 2 Pet. iii. 9. And, putting such Scriptures together, is it not clear that “the last time”
(i.e., the last of the seven times of the Gentiles) is drawing to its close? The three and a half
times of Daniel extend to the convulsive epoch of Mohammed; the second moiety (of the
seven) to our own age. See Faber, Sacred Calendar,4651 vol. i. cap. iii. pp. 308, 309, etc.</p>

<p>VII.
(Peter, upon whom, etc., p. 486.)</p>
<p>Launoi, the eminent Gallican, found but seventeen of the Fathers and Doctors of the
Church (among whom he reckons “Fathers” down to the twelfth century) who understand
St. Peter to be “the rock,” and he cites forty of the contrary opinion.4652 Yet of the “seventeen,”
most of them speak only rhetorically, and with justifiable freedom. I have often done the
same myself, on the principle which the same apostle applies to all Christians: “Ye also as
lively stones,”4653 etc. But it is quite noteworthy that the Council of Trent itself momentarily
adopts the prevailing patristic and therefore the Catholic interpretation, speaking of the
Nicene Creed:4654 “In quo omnes qui fidem Christi profitentur necessario conveniunt, ac
fundamentum firmum et unicum, contra quod portæ inferi nunquam prævalebunt (Matt.
xvi. 18).” Thus, the faith of Peter is confessed the only foundation, in a direct exposition of
the text so often quoted with another intent. In spite of all this, the Creed of Pius IV. was
enjoined as soon as that council closed; and every member of the late Vatican Council was
made to profess the same verbally before any other business was undertaken. Now, even

this spurious creed forced them to swear concerning the Holy Scriptures, “I will never take
and interpret them otherwise than according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.”
Obviously, according to this rule, there is no Catholic doctrine on the subject; much less
any Catholic teaching to the effect that the modern bishops of Rome are “the rock,” as really
as St. Peter himself.</p>

<p>VIII.
(The Eucharist carried in it, p. 488.)</p>
<p>The modern usage of the Latin churches is for the priest to put the wafer into the communicant’s
mouth, an ordinance dating no farther back than a.d. 880. A new doctrine having
been forged, and faith in the corporal presence of Christ being forced upon the conscience,
a change of ceremonial followed, which indicates the novelty of the idea. Contrast the
teaching of St. Cyril of Jerusalem,4655 informing his catechumens how they should receive,
as follows:—</p>
<p>“Approaching, therefore, come not with thy wrists extended, or thy fingers open; but
make thy left hand a sort of cushion for thy right, which is about to receive the King. And
having hollowed thy palm, receive the Body of Christ, saying after it, Amen.” “Not discerning
the Lord’s body,” etc., is the language of Scripture; but, had the apostles taught transubstantiation,
this could not be said, for everybody can discern the host when it is uplifted. The
Lord’s Body is therefore discerned by faith, and so taken and received.</p>

<p>IX.
(Which should be greatest, p. 493.)</p>
<p>How differently our Lord must have settled this inquiry had He given the supremacy
to one of the Apostles, or had He designed the supremacy of any single pastor to be perpetual
in His Church! “Who should be greatest?” ask this question of any Romanist theologian,
and he answers, in the words of the Creed of Pius IV., “the Bishop of Rome, successor to
St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar of Christ.” But why was no such answer given
by our Lord? And why does St. Peter know nothing of it when he says, “The elders who are
among you I exhort, who am also an elder…feed the flock of God, taking the oversight…not
as being lords over God’s heritage,” etc. So also in the Council of Jerusalem, how humbly
he sits under the presidency of James,4656 and again how cheerfully he permits the apostles
to send him forth, and “give him mission” to Samaria!4657 St. Paul, moreover, who was

“not a whit behind the chiefest of the Apostles,”4658 overrules him, and reforms his judgment.
4659</p>
<p>If I have forborne in these notes to refer frequently to the Treatise of Bishop Sage, who
often elucidates our author in a very learned manner, it is because he is almost wholly a
controvertist, and therefore not to my purpose in this work. For his Cyprian,4660 however,
I entertain a sincere respect; and, as it might seem otherwise should I omit all reference to
that work, I place its title in the footnote. Profoundly do I feel what another Scottish Doctor4661
has beautifully said, “It is a loss, even to those that oppose errors and divisions, that
they are forced to be busied that way.”</p>

<p>X.
(From the slender twig, my son, thou hast ascended, p. 513.)</p>
<p>The text of Cyprian4662 is: “Catulus leonis Juda, de frutice fili mi ascendisti, recubans
obdormisti velut leo, et velut catulus leonis.” Now, with this compare the comment of
Calmet, citing the Septuagint (ἐκ βλαστοῦ = e germine), and rendering by metaphrase, “e
medio plantarum, sive herbarum germinantium, ascendisti.”</p>
<p>Here, then, we have the idea precisely equivalent to Jer. xlix. 19: “Ecce quasi leo ascendet
de superbia Jordanis.” The lion is recumbent among the sprouting twigs (frutice, or foliage)
of the Jordan’s banks in the springtime. The swelling of the river, which the melting of snows
from Lebanon causes to overflow, rouses the reposing creature; and he goes up into the
mountains. But Cyprian had in hand the old African,4663 which seems to follow the LXX.,
and St. Jerome’s vulgate did not; and this word frutice animates Cyprian’s poetic genius. Its
springtide imagery corresponding with Easter,4664 he reads into it all the New Testament
fulfilment: “Thou layedst down and sleepedst as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp—but, from the
shooting of the first verdure in spring, thou hast gone up on high—thou hast ascended.” “Quis
excitabit illum” is separated from this in the Paris text, and in the Septuagint, which the Old
Latin followed, and so I have pointed it, though the Edinburgh reads: “and as a lion’s whelp;
who shall stir him up?”</p>

(Third Book…religious teaching of our school, p. 528.)</p>
<p>Quirinus, Cyprian’s “son” in the Gospel, seems to me to have been a catechumen of the
competent class, i.e., preparing for baptism at Easter; or possibly of the higher sort, preparing
for the first communion. Many tokens lead me to surmise that he may have been of Jewish
birth; and, if so, he was probably baptized Quirinus after St. Luke ii. 2, as St. Paul borrowed
his Roman name from Sergius Paulus.4665 The use of the word secta, here rendered “school,”
suggests to me that the Vulgate got it (and so our English version) out of the old African
Latin in Acts xxviii. 22. If Quirinus was a Hebrew, there is a playful irony in Cyprian’s use
of the word in expounding the pure morality of “the sect” everywhere spoken against.</p>
<p>Origen’s treatise Against Celsus shows how cunningly the adversaries of the Gospel
could assume a Jewish position against it;4666 and the first two books of that work are designed
to establish a perfect harmony between the Old Testament and the New, proving
Christ to be the substance and sum of both. Cyprian may have foreseen the perils menacing
the Church from the school of Plotinus, already rising, and which soon sent forth the
venomous Porphyry. He was but a presbyter when he wrote this excellent defence of the
faith; and his earnest pastoral care for his pupil is shown by his addition of a third book,
entirely practical. The catechetical system of St. Luke’s day4667 had become a developed
feature of the Church (St. Cyril’s lectures in the succeeding century show how it was further
expanded), and it also illustrates the purity of her moral teaching. Our author harmonizes
faith and works, and presents her simple scriptural precepts in marked contrast with the
putrid casuistry4668 which Pascal exposes, and which grew up in the West with the enforcement
of auricular confession by Innocent III., a.d. 1215. The theory of transubstantiation
was also made a dogma at the same time, and operated, with the other, to the total extinguishment
of the primitive discipline and worship. The withholding of the chalice in the
Holy Communion followed, a.d. 1415.</p>

Christianity reflecting the Light of the World, and they show us how practically it operated.
As I have noted, the first Christian hospital was founded (a.d. 350) by Ephraem Syrus. His
example was followed by St. Basil, who also founded another for lepers. The founding of
hostels as refuges for travellers was an institution of the Nicene period. “In the time of
Chrysostom,” says one not too well disposed towards the Gospel,4670 “the church of Antioch
supported three thousand widows and virgins, besides strangers and sick. Legacies for the
poor became common; and it was not infrequent for men and women who desired to live
a life of especial sanctity, and especially for priests who attained the episcopacy, as a first
act, to bestow their properties in charity. A Christian, it was maintained, should devote at
least one-tenth of his profits to the poor. A priest named Thalasius collected blind beggars
in an asylum on the banks of the Euphrates. A merchant named Apollinus founded on
Mount Nitria a gratuitous dispensary.”</p>
<p>So here our author’s canons enforce (1) works of mercy; (2) almsdeeds; (3) brotherly
love; (4) mutual support; (5) forgiveness of injuries; (6) the example of Christ’s holy living;
(7) forbearance; (8) suppression of idle talk; (9) love of enemies; (10) abhorrence of usury,
(11) and avarice, (12) and carnal impurity: also, (13) obedience to parents; (14) parental
love; (15) consideration of servants; (16) respect for the aged; (17) moderation, even in use
of things lawful; (18) control of the tongue; (19) abstinence from detraction; (20) to visit
the sick; (21) care of widows and orphans; (22) not to flatter; (23) to practise the Golden
Rule; and (24) to abstain from bloodshed. In short, we have here the outgrowth of the Sermon
on the Mount, and of St. Paul’s epitome, “Whatsoever things are true,” etc.4671</p>

blunders.</p>

into one, as confessedly their material suggests. The Seventy joined also Psalms cxiv. and
Psalms cxv. But they divided Psalms cxvi., and also Psalms cxlvii.</p>
<p>3. The Vulgate Latin follows the LXX.; and our Ante-Nicene Fathers usually quote the
Septuagint, or else the Old Latin, by which the Vulgate was probably governed. In the Vulgate,
also, the Hebrew prefaces are often numbered as if they were verses, which is another source
of confusion.</p>
<p>4. By the fusion of Psalms ix. and Psalms x., our Psalms xv. becomes the Psalms xiv.,
and so the Vulgate gives it; and the Oxford translators follow that.</p>

regard it as a mere corruption of the text, and change it accordingly.</p>

<head>The Seventh Council of Carthage under Cyprian.4673</head>
<p>Concerning the Baptism of Heretics. The Judgment of Eighty-Seven Bishops on
the Baptism of Heretics.</p>
<p>Prooemium.—When Stephen, Bishop of Rome, Had by His Letters Condemned the
Decrees of the African Council on the Baptism of Heretics, Cyprian Lost No
Time in Holding Another Council at Carthage with a Greater Number of Bishops.
Having Therefore Summoned Eighty-Seven Bishops from Africa, Numidia, and
Mauritania, Who Assembled at Carthage in the Kalends of September, a.d. 258,
This Third Council on the Same Matter of Baptism Was Then Celebrated; At
the Beginning of Which, After the Letters on Either Side Had Been Read, Cyprian,
by Implication, Condemns the Assumption of Stephen.4674</p>
<p>When, in the kalends of September, a great many bishops from the provinces of Africa,
Numidia, and Mauritania, had met together at Carthage, together with the presbyters and
deacons, and a considerable part of the congregation who were also present; and when the
letter of Jubaianus written to Cyprian had been read, as also the reply of Cyprian to Jubaianus,
about baptizing heretics, and what the same Jubaianus had subsequently rejoined to Cyprian,—
Cyprian said: You have heard, my dearly beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus our cobishop
has written to me, taking counsel of my poor intelligence concerning the unlawful
and profane baptism of heretics, as well as what I wrote in answer to him, decreeing, to wit,
what we have once and again and frequently determined, that heretics who come to the
Church must be baptized and sanctified by the baptism of the Church. Moreover, another
letter of Jubaianus has also been read to you, wherein, replying, in accordance with his sincere
and religious devotion, to my letter, he not only acquiesced in what I had said, but, confessing
that he had been instructed thereby, he returned thanks for it. It remains, that upon this
same matter each of us should bring forward what we think, judging no man, nor rejecting
any one from the right of communion, if he should think differently from us. For neither

<note type="footnote">4674 Of this council there exists no further memorials than such as have been here collected from Cyprian,
and from St. Augustine, De Baptismo contra Donatistas, book iii. ch. iv., v., and vi., and book vii. ch. i.; and in
these nothing else is contained than the judgments of the eighty-seven bishops on the nullity of baptism administered
by heretics. If any one desires to see these judgments impugned, let him consult Augustine as above. The
results of this council are given in Ep. lxxi. p. 378, supra.</note>

does any of us set himself up as a bishop of bishops,4675 nor by tyrannical terror does any
compel his colleague to the necessity of obedience; since every bishop, according to the allowance
of his liberty and power, has his own proper right of judgment, and can no more
be judged by another than he himself can judge another.4676 But let us all wait for the
judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only one that has the power both of preferring
us in the government of His Church, and of judging us in our conduct there.</p>
<p>Cæcilius of Bilta4677 said: I know only one baptism in the Church, and none out of the
Church. This one will be here, where there is the true hope and the certain faith. For thus
it is written: “One faith, one hope, one baptism;”4678 not among heretics, where there is no
hope, and the faith is false, where all things are carried on by lying; where a demoniac exorcises;
where one4679 whose mouth and words send forth a cancer puts the sacramental interrogation;
4680 the faithless gives faith; the wicked bestows pardon of sins; and Antichrist
baptizes in the name of Christ; he who is cursed of God blesses; he who is dead promises
life; he who is unpeaceful gives peace; the blasphemer calls upon God; the profane person
administers the office of the priesthood; the sacrilegious person establishes an altar. In addition
to all these things, there is also this evil, that the priests of the devil dare to celebrate
the Eucharist; or else let those who stand by them say that all these things concerning heretics
are false. Behold to what kind of things the Church is compelled4681 to consent, and is
constrained without baptism, without pardon of sins, to hold communion. And this thing,
brethren, we ought to flee from and avoid, and to separate ourselves from so great a
wickedness, and to hold one baptism, which is granted by the Lord to the Church alone.</p>
<p>Primus of Misgirpa4682 said: I decide, that every man who comes to us from heresy
must be baptized. For in vain does he think that he has been baptized there, seeing that there
is no baptism save the one and true baptism in the Church; because not only is God one,
but the faith is one, and the Church is one, wherein stands the one baptism, and holiness,
and the rest. For whatever is done without, has no effect of salvation.</p>

<p>Polycarp from Adrumetum4683 said: They who approve the baptism of heretics make
void our baptism.</p>
<p>Novatus of Thamugada4684 said: Although we know that all the Scriptures give witness
concerning the saving baptism, still we ought to declare our faith, that heretics and schismatics
who come to the Church, and appear to have been falsely baptized, ought to be
baptized in the everlasting fountain; and therefore, according to the testimony of the
Scriptures, and according to the decree of our colleagues, men of most holy memory, that
all schismatics and heretics who are converted to the Church must be baptized; and moreover,
that those who appeared to have been ordained must be received among lay people.</p>
<p>Nemesianus of Thubunæ4685 said: That the baptism which heretics and schismatics
bestow is not the true one, is everywhere declared in the Holy Scriptures, since their very
leading men are false Christs and false prophets, as the Lord says by Solomon: “He who
trusteth in that which is false, he feedeth the winds; and the very same, moreover, followeth
the flight of birds. For he forsaketh the ways of his own vineyard, he has wandered from the
paths of his own little field. But he walketh through pathless places, and dry, and a land
destined for thirst; moreover, he gathereth together fruitless things in his hands.”4686 And
again: “Abstain from strange water, and from the fountain of another do not drink, that
you may live a long time; also that the years of life may be added to thee.”4687 And in the
Gospel our Lord Jesus Christ spoke with His divine voice, saying, “Except a man be born
again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.”4688 This is the Spirit
which from the beginning was borne over the waters; for neither can the Spirit operate
without the water, nor the water without the Spirit. Certain people therefore interpret for
themselves ill, when they say that by imposition of the hand they receive the Holy Ghost,
and are thus received, when it is manifest that they ought to be born again in the Catholic
Church by both sacraments. Then indeed they will be able to be sons of God, as says the
apostle: “Taking care to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body,
and one Spirit, as ye have been called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one
baptism, one God.”4689 All these things speaks the Catholic Church.4690 And again, in the

Gospel the Lord says: “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit; because God is a Spirit, and he is born of God.”4691 Therefore, whatsoever
things all heretics and schismatics do are carnal, as the apostle says: “For the works of the
flesh are manifest, which are, fornications, uncleannesses, incest, idolatries, witchcrafts,
hatreds, contentions, jealousy, anger, divisions, heresies, and the like to these; concerning
which have told you before, as I also foretell you now, that whoever do such things shall not
inherit the kingdom of God.”4692 And thus the apostle condemns, with all the wicked, those
also who cause division, that is, schismatics and heretics. Unless therefore they receive saving
baptism in the Catholic Church, which is one, they cannot be saved, but will be condemned
with the carnal in the judgment of the Lord Christ.</p>
<p>Januarius of Lambesis4693 said: According to the authority4694 of the Holy Scriptures,
I decree that all heretics must be baptized, and so admitted into the holy Church.</p>
<p>Lucius of Castra Galbæ4695 said: Since the Lord in His Gospel said, “Ye are the salt of
the earth: but if the salt should have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is
thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out of doors, and to be trodden under foot of
men.”4696 And again, after His resurrection, sending His apostles, He gave them charge,
saying, “All power is given unto me, in heaven and in earth. Go and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”4697 Since,
therefore, it is manifest that heretics—that is, the enemies of Christ—have not the sound
confession of the sacrament; moreover, that schismatics cannot season others with spiritual
wisdom, since they themselves, by departing from the Church, which is one, having lost the
savour, have become contrary to it,—let it be done as it is written, “The house of those that
are contrary to the law owes a cleansing.”4698 And it is a consequence that those who, having
been baptized by people who are contrary to the Church, are polluted, must first be cleansed,
and then at length be baptized.</p>

that with reason we ought, all being made one by the grace of God, to consent to them; I
judge that all heretics and schismatics who wish to come to the Catholic Church, shall not
be allowed to enter without they have first been exorcised and baptized; with the exception
of those indeed who may previously have been baptized in the Catholic Church, and these
in such a way that they may be reconciled to the penitence of the Church by the imposition
of hands.</p>
<p>Nicomedes of Segermæ4700 said: My opinion is this, that heretics coming to the Church
should be baptized, for the reason that among sinners without they can obtain no remission
of sins.</p>
<p>Munnulus4701 of Girba4702 said: The truth of our Mother4703 the Catholic Church,
brethren, hath always remained and still remains with us, and even especially in the Trinity
of baptism, as our Lord says, “Go ye and baptize the nations, in the name of the Father, of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”4704 Since, then, we manifestly know that heretics have not
either Father, or Son, or Holy Spirit, they ought, when they come to the Church our Mother,
truly to be born again and to be baptized; that the cancer which they had, and the anger of
damnation, and the witchery of error, may be sanctified by the holy and heavenly laver.</p>
<p>Secundinus of Cedias4705 said: Since our Lord Christ says, “He who is not with me is
against me;”4706 and John the apostle calls those who depart from the Church Antichrists—undoubtedly
enemies of Christ—any such as are called Antichrists cannot minister the grace
of saving baptism. And therefore I think that those who flee from the snares of the heretics
to the Church must be baptized by us, who are called friends of God, of His condescension.</p>
<p>Felix of Bagai4707 said: As, when the blind leads the blind, they fall together into the
ditch; so, when the heretic baptizes a heretic, they fall together into death. And therefore a
heretic must be baptized and made alive, lest we who are alive should hold communion
with the dead.</p>

<p>Dativus of Badis4710 said: We, as far as in us lies, do not hold communion with heretics,
unless they have been baptized in the Church, and have received remission of their sins.</p>
<p>Successus of Abbir Germaniciana4711 said: Heretics can either do nothing, or they can
do all. If they can baptize, they can also bestow the Holy Spirit. But if they cannot give the
Holy Spirit, because they have not the Holy Spirit, neither can they spiritually baptize.
Therefore we judge that heretics must be baptized.</p>
<p>Fortunatus of Tuccaboris4712 said: Jesus Christ our Lord and God, Son of God the
Father and Creator, built His Church upon a rock,4713 not upon heresy; and gave the power
of baptizing to bishops, not to heretics. Wherefore they who are without the Church, and,
standing in opposition to Christ, disperse His sheep and flock, cannot baptize, being without.</p>
<p>Sedatus of Tuburbo4714 said: In the degree in which water sanctified in the Church by
the prayer of the priest, washes away sins; in that degree, if infected with heretical discourse
as with a cancer, it heaps up sins. Wherefore we must endeavour with all peaceful powers,
that no one infected and stained with heretical error refuse to receive the single and true
baptism of the Church, by which whosoever is not baptized, shall become an alien from the
kingdom of heaven. Privatianus of Sufetula4715 said: Let him who says that heretics have
the power of baptizing, say first who founded heresy. For if heresy is of God, it also may
have the divine indulgence. But if it is not from God, how can it either have the grace of
God, or confer it upon any one?</p>
<p>Privatus of Sufes4716 said: He who approves the baptism of heretics, what else does he
do than communicate with heretics?</p>

which we know not except in the Church. Or how can they baptize any one in the name of
Christ, whom Christ Himself declares to be His adversaries?</p>
<p>Cassius of Macomadæ4719 said: Since there cannot be two baptisms, he who yields
baptism to the heretics takes it away from himself. I judge therefore that heretics, lamentable
and corrupt, must be baptized when they begin to come to the Church; and that when
washed by the sacred and divine washing, and illuminated by the light of life, they may be
received into the Church, not as enemies, but as made peaceful; not as foreigners, but as of
the household of the faith of the Lord; not as children of adultery, but as sons of God; not
of error, but of salvation; except those who once faithful have been supplanted, and have
passed over from the Church to the darkness of heresy, but that these must be restored by
the imposition of hands.</p>
<p>Another Januarius of Vicus Cæsaris4720 said: If error does not obey truth, much more
truth does not consent to error; and therefore we stand by the Church in which we preside,
that, claiming her baptism for herself alone, we should baptize those whom the Church has
not baptized.</p>
<p>Another Secundinus of Carpi4721 said: Are heretics Christians or not? If they are
Christians, why are they not in the Church of God? If they are not Christians, how come
they to make Christians? Or whither will tend the Lord’s discourse, when He says, “He that
is not with me is against me, and he who gathereth not with me scattereth?”4722 Whence it
appears plain that upon strange children, and on the offspring of Antichrist, the Holy Ghost
cannot descend only by imposition of hands, since it is manifest that heretics have not
baptism.</p>
<p>Victoricus of Thabraca4723 said: If heretics are allowed to baptize and to give remission
of sins, wherefore do we brand them with infamy and call them heretics?</p>
<p>Another Felix of Uthina4724 said: Nobody doubts, most holy fellow-priests, that human
presumption is not able to do so much as the adorable and venerable majesty of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Therefore, remembering the danger, we ought not only to observe this also,
but moreover to confirm it by the voice of all of us, that all heretics who come to the bosom
of Mother Church should be baptized, that thus the heretical mind that has been polluted
by a long decay, purged by the sanctification of the laver, may be reformed for the better.</p>

<p>Quietus of Baruch4725 said: We who live by faith ought to obey with careful observance
those things which before have been foretold for our instruction. For it is written in Solomon:
“He that is baptized from the dead, (and again toucheth the dead,4726) what availeth his
washing?”4727 which certainly speaks of those who are washed by heretics, and of those that
wash them. For if those who are baptized among them obtain by remission of their sins life
eternal, why do they come to the Church? But if from a dead person no salvation is received,
and therefore, acknowledging their previous error, they return to the truth with penitence,
they ought to be sanctified with the one vital baptism which is in the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Castus of Sicca4728 said: He who with contempt of the truth presumes to follow custom,
is either envious and malignant in respect of his brethren to whom the truth is revealed, or
is ungrateful in respect of God, by whose inspiration His Church is instructed.</p>
<p>Euchratius of Thenæ4729 said: God and our Lord Jesus Christ, teaching the apostles
with His own mouth, has entirely completed our faith, and the grace of baptism, and the
rule of the ecclesiastical law, saying: “Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”4730 Thus the false and wicked
baptism of heretics must be rejected by us, and refuted with all detestation, from whose
mouth is expressed poison, not life, not celestial grace, but blasphemy of the Trinity.4731
And therefore it is manifest that heretics who come to the Church ought to be baptized with
the sound and Catholic baptism, in order that, being purified from the blasphemy of their
presumption, they may be reformed by the grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Libosus of Vaga4732 said: In the Gospel the Lord says, “I am the truth.”4733 He said not,</p>
<p>“I am the custom.” Therefore the truth being manifest, let custom yield to truth; so that,
although for the past any one was not in the habit of baptizing heretics in the Church, let
him now begin to baptize them.4734</p>

<p>Lucius of Thebeste4735 said: I determine that blasphemous and unrighteous heretics,
who with various words tear asunder the holy and adorable words of the Scriptures, are to

<p>Eugenius of Ammedera4736 said: And I determine the same—that heretics must be
baptized.</p>
<p>Also another Felix of Amaccora4737 said: And I myself, following the authority of the
divine Scriptures,4738 judge that heretics must be baptized; and, moreover, those also who
contend that they have been baptized among the schismatics. For if, according to Christ’s
warning, our font is private to us, let all the adversaries of our Church understand that it
cannot be for another. Nor can He who is the Shepherd of the one flock give the saving
water to two peoples. And therefore it is plain that neither heretics nor schismatics can receive
anything heavenly, seeing that they dare to receive from men who are sinners, and from
those who are external to the Church. When there is no place for the giver, assuredly there
is no profit for the receiver.</p>
<p>Also another Januarius of Muzzuli4739 said: I am surprised, since all confess that there
is one baptism, that all do not perceive the unity of the same baptism. For the Church and
heresy are two things, and different things. If heretics have baptism, we have it not; but if
we have it, heretics cannot have it. But there is no doubt that the Church alone possesses
the baptism of Christ, since she alone possesses both the grace and the truth of Christ.
Adelphius of Thasvalte4740 said: Certain persons without reason impugn the truth by
false and envious words, in saying that we rebaptize, when the Church does not rebaptize
heretics, but baptizes them.</p>
<p>Demetrius of Leptiminus4741 said: We maintain one baptism, because we demand for
the Church Catholic alone her own property. But they who say that heretics truly and legitimately
baptize, are themselves the people who make not one, but many baptisms. For since
heresies are many, according to their number will be reckoned baptisms.</p>
<p>Vincentius of Thibaris4742 said: We know that heretics are worse than Gentiles. If,

ye, lay on hands in my name, expel demons.”4743 And in another place: “Go ye and teach
the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”4744
Therefore first of all by imposition of hands in exorcism, secondly by the regeneration of
baptism, they may then come to the promise of Christ. Otherwise I think it ought not to be
done.</p>
<p>Marcus of Mactaris4745 said: It is not to be wondered at if heretics, enemies, and impugners
of the truth claim to themselves a matter in the power and condescension of others.
But it is to be wondered at, that some of us, prevaricators of the truth, support heretics and
oppose themselves to Christians. Therefore we decree that heretics must be baptized.</p>
<p>Sattius of Sicilibba4746 said: If to heretics in baptism their sins are remitted, they come
to the Church without reason. For since, in the day of judgment, they are sins which are
punished, there is nothing which the heretics can fear from Christ’s judgment, if they have
already obtained remission of their sins.</p>
<p>Victor of Gor4747 said: Since sins are not remitted4748 save in the baptism of the Church,
he who admits a heretic to communion without baptism does two things against reason: he
does not cleanse the heretics, and he befouls the Christians.</p>
<p>Aurelius of Utica4749 said: Since the apostle says that we are not to communicate with
other people’s sins, what else does he do but communicate with other people’s sins, who
holds communion with heretics without the Church’s baptism? And therefore I judge that
heretics must be baptized, that they may receive forgiveness of their sins; and thus communion
may be had with them.</p>
<p>Iambus of Germaniciana4750 said: They who approve of the baptism of heretics, disapprove
of ours, in denying that they who are, I will not say washed, but befouled, outside the

be among heretics?</p>
<p>Jader of Midila4755 said: We know that there is but one baptism in the Catholic Church,
and therefore we ought not to receive a heretic unless he has been baptized among us; lest
he should think that he has been baptized out of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Also another Felix of Marazana4756 said: There is one faith, one baptism, but of the

truth of the Church, since the apostle says, “For what if some of them have fallen away from
the faith? Has their unbelief made the faith of God of no effect? By no means. For God is
true, but every man a liar.”4758 But if God is true, how can the truth of baptism be among
the heretics, among whom God is not?</p>
<p>Pomponius of Dionysiana4759 said: It is evident that heretics cannot baptize and give
remission of sins, seeing that they have not power to be able to loose or to bind anything

corrupted by any one. Christ the Lord and our God, going to His Father, has commended
to us His bride. Shall we guard her incorrupt and inviolate, or shall we betray her integrity
and chastity to adulterers and corrupters? For he who makes the Church’s baptism common
to heretics, betrays the spouse of Christ to adulterers.</p>

<p>(To them we have succeeded, p. 572.)</p>
<p>The theory of Cyprian is thus recognised in full council, by his colleagues, with respect
to the unity of the Church Catholic. They have never heard of any counter theory, and they
state it as a matter of course. Fortunatus of “Tuccaboris” had shortly before referred to the
Church as “built upon a rock,” with evident reference to the faith, for he adds, “not upon
heresy.” Of a perpetuated construction, of which any one bishop was the perpetuated
foundation, nobody as yet seems to have dreamed. “Other foundation can no man lay than
that is laid,” says St. Paul; viz., “Christ.” On Him, “the Stone, Elect, precious,” St. Peter and
all the apostles (the prophets as well) are built as foundation-stones; and we also, as “lively
stones,” are built upon that foundation,4814 into a holy temple.</p>
<p>This Council of Carthage sustains Cyprian also in his judgment concerning the question
of baptism, and it is a mistake to say that it was ever overruled. Compare St. Basil, Ad Amphilochium
(Epist. Canonica prima, p. 19, vol. iii., ed. Paris, 1638), where he refers to Cyprian
and Firmilian (“our Firmilian”) as “ancient men,” and treats the question as still an open
one.</p>

<head>Translator’s Introduction
to
Treatises Attributed to Cyprian on Questionable Authority.</head>
<p>The treatises which follow are usually classed under the doubtful works of Cyprian.
Baluzius, however, gives the two first, On the Public Shows, and On the Glory of Martyrdom,
among the genuine Opuscula, and says: “I have not thought it fit to prejudice any one amid
the diversity of opinions on the subject, but have refrained from separating the following
from the genuine works of the blessed martyr, especially since many have observed that
there is no such difference of style in these writings as to justify the denial of their authorship
to Cyprian.”</p>
<p>Of course the question is one almost entirely of criticism, and the translator leaves the
discussion of it to abler hands. He ventures, however, to record his impression, that the style
of the following writings throughout is more pretentious and laboured, and far more wordy
and involved, than that of Cyprian’s undoubted works. With a more copious vocabulary,
there is manifested less skill in the use of words; and if the text be not in some places most
elaborately and unintelligibly corrupt, the accumulation of epithets, as well as their collocation,
seems the very wantonness of rhetoric. The text, however, is undoubtedly far less to
be depended upon than in the case of the genuine works.</p>
<p>The treatises On the Discipline and Benefit of Chastity and the Exhortation to Repentance
are generally placed under the Opuscula dubia. The former was first edited by Baluzius, with
the title “Epistle of an Unknown Author.” Its Cyprianic authorship was maintained by Bellarmin,
Pamelius, and others; while Erasmus, Tillemont, and others have rejected it as
spurious. The second treatise was first published by Joannes Chrysostomus Trombellius (in
1751), who regarded it as a genuine work of Cyprian’s. And indeed, as far as internal evidence
goes, the treatise, consisting merely of a collection of quotations from Scripture, in the
manner of the Testimonies against the Jews, may probably be attributed to him with as much
reason as the Testimonies.</p>
<p>It is, however, right to add, that Professor Blunt quotes from the Treatise on the Glory
of Martyrdom as being Cyprian’s, without referring to any doubts on the subject.4815</p>

<p>Argument.4817—The Writer First of All Treats Against Those Who Endeavoured to
Defend the Public Exhibitions of the Heathens by Scriptural Authority; And He
Proves That, Although They are Never Prohibited by the Express Words of

<p>1. Cyprian to the congregation who stand fast in the Gospel, sends greeting. As it greatly
saddens me, and deeply afflicts my soul, when no opportunity of writing to you is presented
to me, for it is my loss not to hold converse with you; so nothing restores to me such joyfulness
and hilarity, as when that opportunity is once more afforded me. I think that I am with
you when I am speaking to you by letter. Although, therefore, I know that you are satisfied
that what I tell you is even as I say, and that you have no doubt of the truth of my words,
nevertheless an actual proof will also attest the reality of the matter. For my affection (for
you) is proved, when absolutely no opportunity (of writing) is passed over. However certain
I may be, then, that you are no less respectable in the conduct of your life than faithful in
respect of your sacramental vow;4819 still, since there are not wanting smooth-tongued advocates
of vice, and indulgent patrons who afford authority to vices, and, what is worse,
convert the rebuke of the heavenly Scriptures into an advocacy of crimes; as if the pleasure
derived from the public exhibitions might be sought after as being innocent, by way of a
mental relaxation;—for thereby the vigour of ecclesiastical discipline is so relaxed, and is so
deteriorated by all the languor of vice that it is no longer apology, but authority, that is given
for wickedness,—it seemed good in a few words not now to instruct you, but to admonish

<note type="footnote">4818 He then prosecutes the subject, by going through the several kinds of public exhibitions, and sets forth,
a little more diffusely than in the Epistle to Donatus, what risks are incurred by the spectators, and especially in
respect of those exhibitions wherein, as he says, “representations of lust convey instruction in obscenity.” Finally,
he briefly enumerates such exhibitions as are worthy of the interest of a Christian man, and in which he ought
rightfully to find pleasure. [For Epistle to Donatus, see p. 275, supra.]</note>

you who are instructed, lest, because the wounds are badly bound up, they should break
through the cicatrix of their closed soundness. For no mischief is put an end to with so much
difficulty but that its recurrence is easy, so long as it is both maintained by the consent, and
caressed by the excuses4820 of the multitude.</p>
<p>2. Believers, and men who claim for themselves the authority of the Christian name,
are not ashamed—are not, I repeat, ashamed to find a defence in the heavenly Scriptures
for the vain superstitions associated with the public exhibitions of the heathens, and thus
to attribute divine authority to idolatry. For how is it, that what is done by the heathens in
honour of any idol is resorted to in a public show by faithful Christians, and the heathen
idolatry is maintained, and the true and divine religion is trampled upon in contempt of
God? Shame binds me to relate their pretexts and defences in this behalf. “Where,” say they,
“are there such Scriptures? where are these things prohibited? On the contrary, both Elias
is the charioteer of Israel, and David himself danced before the ark. We read of psalteries,
horns,4821 trumpets, drums, pipes, harps, and choral dances. Moreover, the apostle, in his
struggle, puts before us the contest of the Cæstus, and of our wrestle against the spiritual
things of wickedness. Again, when he borrows his illustrations from the racecourse, he also
proposes the prize of the crown. Why, then, may not a faithful Christian man gaze upon
that which the divine pen might write about?” At this point I might not unreasonably say
that it would have been far better for them not to know any writings at all, than thus to read
the Scriptures.4822 For words and illustrations which are recorded by way of exhortation to
evangelical virtue, are translated by them into pleas for vice; because those things are written
of, not that they should be gazed upon, but that a greater eagerness might be aroused in our
minds in respect of things that will benefit us, seeing that among the heathens there is
manifest so much eagerness in respect of things which will be of no advantage.</p>
<p>3. These are therefore an argument to stimulate virtue, not a permission or a liberty to
look upon heathen error, that by this consideration the mind may be more inflamed to
Gospel virtue for the sake of the divine rewards, since through the suffering of all these labours
and pains it is granted to attain to eternal benefits. For that Elias is the charioteer of
Israel is no defence for gazing upon the public games; for he ran his race in no circus. And
that David in the presence of God led the dances, is no sanction for faithful Christians to
occupy seats in the public theatre; for David did not twist his limbs about in obscene
movements, to represent in his dancing the story of Grecian lust. Psalteries, horns, pipes,
drums, harps, were used in the service of the Lord, and not of idols. Let it not on this account
be objected that unlawful things may be gazed upon; for by the artifice of the devil these are

<note type="footnote">4821 “Nabla.”</note>
<note type="footnote">4822 [In Edin. trans. needlessly “the writings of the Scriptures.”]</note>

<pb n="1407"/>
changed from things holy to things unlawful. Then let shame demur to these things, even
if the Holy Scriptures cannot. For there are certain things wherein the Scripture is more
careful in giving instruction. Acquiescing in the claim of modesty, it has forbidden more
where it has been silent. The truth, if it descended low enough to deal with such things,
would think very badly of its faithful votaries. For very often, in matters of precept, some
things are advantageously said nothing about; they often remind when they are expressly
forbidden. So also there is an implied silence even in the writings of the Scripture; and
severity speaks in the place of precepts; and reason teaches where Scripture has held its
peace. Let every man only take counsel with himself, and let him speak consistently with
the character of his profession,4823 and then he will never do any of these things.4824 For
that conscience will have more weight which shall be indebted to none other than itself.</p>
<p>4. What has Scripture interdicted? Certainly it has forbidden gazing upon what it forbids
to be done. It condemned, I say, all those kinds of exhibitions when it abrogated idolatry—the
mother of all public amusements,4825 whence these prodigies of vanity and lightness came.
For what public exhibition is without an idol? what amusement without a sacrifice? what
contest is not consecrated to some dead person? And what does a faithful Christian do in
the midst of such things as these? If he avoids idolatry, why does he4826 who is now sacred
take pleasure in things which are worthy of reproach? Why does he approve of superstitions
which are opposed to God, and which he loves while he gazes upon them? Besides, let him
be aware that all these things are the inventions of demons, not of God. He is shameless
who in the church exorcises demons while he praises their delights in public shows; and
although, once for all renouncing him, he has put away everything in baptism, when he goes
to the devil’s exhibition after (receiving) Christ, he renounces Christ as much as (he had
done) the devil. Idolatry, as I have already said, is the mother of all the public amusements;
and this, in order that faithful Christians may come under its influence, entices them by the
delight of the eyes and the ears. Romulus was the first who consecrated the games of the
circus to Consus as the god of counsel, in reference to the rape of the Sabine women. But
the rest of the scenic amusements were provided to distract the attention of the people while
famine invaded the city, and were subsequently dedicated to Ceres and Bacchus, and to the
rest of the idols and dead men. Those Grecian contests, whether in poems, or in instrumental
music, or in words, or in personal prowess, have as their guardians various demons; and
whatever else there is which either attracts the eyes or allures the ears of the spectators, if it
<note type="footnote">4823 “Cum persona professionis suæ loquatur.”</note>

<pb n="1408"/>
be investigated in reference to its origin and institution, presents as its reason either an idol,
or a demon, or a dead man. Thus the devil, who is their original contriver, because he knew
that naked idolatry would by itself excite repugnance, associated it with public exhibitions,
that for the sake of their attraction it might be loved.</p>
<p>5. What is the need of prosecuting the subject further, or of describing the unnatural
kinds of sacrifices in the public shows, among which sometimes even a man becomes the
victim by the fraud of the priest, when the gore, yet hot from the throat, is received in the
foaming cup while it still steams, and, as if it were thrown into the face of the thirsting idol,
is brutally drunk in pledge to it; and in the midst of the pleasures of the spectators the death
of some is eagerly besought, so that by means of a bloody exhibition men may learn fierceness,
as if a man’s own private frenzy were of little account to him unless he should learn it also
in public? For the punishment of a man, a rabid wild beast is nourished with delicacies,
that he may become the more cruelly ferocious under the eyes of the spectators. The skilful
trainer instructs the brute, which perhaps might have been more merciful had not its more
brutal master taught it cruelty. Then, to say nothing of whatever idolatry more generally
recommends, how idle are the contests themselves; strifes in colours, contentions in races,
acclamations in mere questions of honour; rejoicing because a horse has been more fleet,
grieving because it was more sluggish, reckoning up the years of cattle, knowing the consuls
under whom they ran, learning their age, tracing their breed, recording their very grandsires
and great-grand-sires! How unprofitable a matter is all this; nay, how disgraceful and ignominious!
This very man, I say, who can compute by memory the whole family of his equine
race, and can relate it with great quickness without interfering with the exhibition—were
you to inquire of this man who were the parents of Christ, he cannot tell, or he is the more
unfortunate if he can. But if, again, I should ask him by what road he has come to that exhibition,
he will confess (that he has come) by the naked bodies of prostitutes and of profligate
women, by (scenes of) public lust, by public disgrace, by vulgar lasciviousness, by the
common contempt of all men. And, not to object to him what perchance he has done, still
he has seen what was not fit to be done, and he has trained his eyes to the exhibition of idolatry
by lust: he would have dared, had he been able, to take that which is holy into the brothel
with him; since, as he hastens to the spectacle when dismissed from the Lord’s table, and
still bearing within him, as often occurs, the Eucharist, that unfaithful man has carried about
the holy body of Christ among the filthy bodies of harlots, and has deserved a deeper condemnation
for the way by which he has gone thither, than for the pleasure he has received
from the exhibition.</p>
<p>6. But now to pass from this to the shameless corruption of the stage. I am ashamed to
tell what things are said; I am even ashamed to denounce the things that are done—the
tricks of arguments, the cheatings of adulterers, the immodesties of women, the scurrile
jokes, the sordid parasites, even the toga’d fathers of families themselves, sometimes stupid,

<pb n="1409"/>
sometimes obscene, but in all cases dull, in all cases immodest. And though no individual,
or family, or profession, is spared by the discourse4827 of these reprobates, yet every one
flocks to the play. The general infamy is delightful to see or to recognise; it is a pleasure,
nay, even to learn it. People flock thither to the public disgrace of the brothel for the teaching
of obscenity, that nothing less may be done in secret than what is learnt in public; and in
the midst of the laws themselves is taught everything that the laws forbid. What does a
faithful Christian do among these things, since he may not even think upon wickedness?
Why does he find pleasure in the representations of lust, so as among them to lay aside his
modesty and become more daring in crimes? He is learning to do, while he is becoming
accustomed to see. Nevertheless, those women whom their misfortune has introduced and
degraded to this slavery, conceal their public wantonness, and find consolation for their
disgrace in their concealment. Even they who have sold their modesty blush to appear to
have done so. But that public prodigy is transacted in the sight of all, and the obscenity of
prostitutes is surpassed. A method is sought to commit adultery with the eyes. To this infamy
an infamy fully worthy of it is super added: a human being broken down in every limb, a
man melted to something beneath the effeminacy of a woman, has found the art to supply
language with his hands; and on behalf of one—I know not what, but neither man nor woman—
the whole city is in a state of commotion, that the fabulous debaucheries of antiquity
may be represented in a ballet. Whatever is not lawful is so beloved, that what had even been
lost sight of by the lapse of time is brought back again into the recollection of the eyes.</p>
<p>7. It is not sufficient for lust to make use of its present means of mischief, unless by the
exhibition it makes its own that in which a former age had also gone wrong. It is not lawful,
I say, for faithful Christians to be present; it is not lawful, I say, at all, even for those whom
for the delight of their ears Greece sends everywhere to all who are instructed in her vain
arts.4828 One imitates the hoarse warlike clangours of the trumpet; another with his breath
blowing into a pipe regulates its mournful sounds; another with dances, and with the musical
voice of a man, strives with his breath, which by an effort he had drawn from his bowels
into the upper parts of his body, to play upon the stops of pipes; now letting forth the sound,
and now closing it up inside, and forcing it into the air by certain openings of the stops;
now breaking the sound in measure, he endeavours to speak with his fingers, ungrateful to
the Artificer who gave him a tongue. Why should I speak of comic and useless efforts? Why

of those great tragic vocal ravings? Why of strings set vibrating with noise? These things,
even if they were not dedicated to idols,4829 ought not to be approached and gazed upon
by faithful Christians; because, even if they were not criminal, they are characterized by a
worthlessness which is extreme, and which is little suited to believers.</p>
<p>8. Now that other folly of others is an obvious source of advantage to idle men; and the
first victory is for the belly to be able to crave food beyond the human limit,—a flagitious
traffic for the claim to the crown of gluttony: the wretched face is hired out to bear wounding
blows, that the more wretched belly may be gorged. How disgusting, besides, are those
struggles! Man lying below man is enfolded in abominable embraces and twinings. In such
a contest, whether a man looks on or conquers, still his modesty is conquered. Behold, one
naked man bounds forth towards you; another with straining powers tosses a brazen ball
into the air. This is not glory, but folly. In fine, take away the spectator, and you will have
shown its emptiness. Such things as these should be avoided by faithful Christians, as I have
frequently said already; spectacles so vain, so mischievous, so sacrilegious, from which both
our eyes and our ears should be guarded. We quickly get accustomed to what we hear and
what we see. For since man’s mind is itself drawn towards vice, what will it do if it should
have inducements of a bodily nature as well as a downward tendency in its slippery will?
What will it do if it should be impelled from without?4830 Therefore the mind must be called
away from such things as these.</p>
<p>9. The Christian has nobler exhibitions, if he wishes for them. He has true and profitable
pleasures, if he will recollect himself. And to say nothing of those which he cannot yet contemplate,
he has that beauty of the world to look upon and admire.4831 He may gaze upon
the sun’s rising, and again on its setting, as it brings round in their mutual changes days
and nights; the moon’s orb, designating in its waxings and warnings the courses of the seasons;
the troops of shining stars, and those which glitter from on high with extreme mobility,—
their members divided through the changes of the entire year, and the days themselves
with the nights distributed into hourly periods; the heavy mass of the earth balanced by the
mountains, and the flowing rivers with their sources; the expanse of seas, with their waves
and shores; and meanwhile, the air, subsisting equally everywhere in perfect harmony, expanded
in the midst of all, and in concordant bonds animating all things with its delicate
life, now scattering showers from the contracted clouds, now recalling the serenity of the

sky with its refreshed purity; and in all these spheres their appropriate tenants—in the air
the birds, in the waters the fishes, on the earth man. Let these, I say, and other divine works,
be the exhibitions for faithful Christians. What theatre built by human hands could ever be
compared to such works as these? Although it may be reared with immense piles of stones,
the mountain crests are loftier; and although the fretted roofs glitter with gold, they will be
surpassed by the brightness of the starry firmament.4832 Never will any one admire the
works of man, if he has recognised himself as the son of God. He degrades himself from the
height of his nobility, who can admire anything but the Lord.</p>
<p>10. Let the faithful Christian, I say, devote himself to the sacred Scriptures,4833 and there
he shall find worthy exhibitions for his faith. He will see God establishing His world, and
making not only the other animals, but that marvellous and better fabric of man. He will
gaze upon the world in its delightfulness, righteous shipwrecks, the rewards of the good,
and the punishments of the impious, seas drained dry by a people, and again from the rock
seas spread out by a people. He will behold harvests descending from heaven, not pressed
in by the plough; rivers with their hosts of waters bridled in, exhibiting dry crossings. He
will behold in some cases faith struggling with the flame, wild beasts overcome by devotion
and soothed into gentleness. He will look also upon souls brought back even from death.
Moreover, he will consider the marvellous souls brought back to the life of bodies which
themselves were already consumed. And in all these things he will see a still greater exhibition—
that devil who had triumphed over the whole world lying prostrate under the feet of
Christ. How honourable is this exhibition, brethren! how delightful, how needful ever to
gaze upon one’s hope, and to open our eyes to one’s salvation! This is a spectacle which is
beheld even when sight is lost. This is an exhibition which is given by neither prætor nor
consul, but by Him who is alone and above all things, and before all things, yea, and of
whom are all things, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and honour for
ever and ever. I bid you, brethren, ever heartily farewell. Amen.4834</p>

<head>On the Glory of Martyrdom.4835</head>
<p>Argument.—The Glory of Martyrdom,—Namely, What Martyrdom Is, How Great
It Is, and of What Advantage It is. By Similitudes, and by Argument Deduced
from the Daily Deaths, the Author Exhorts to a Joyous Submission to Death for
Christ’s Sake.4836 Among the Benefits of Martyrdom He Maintains that Without
Experience of the Universal Suffering that Prevails, the Propitiation of Christ
Crowns Martyrs in Such a Way that His Saying About the Very Last Farthing is
Not Applicable to Them.</p>
<p>1. Although, beloved brethren, it is unfitting, while my speaking to you receives this
indulgence, to profess any trepidation, and it very little becomes me to diminish the glory
of so great a devotion by the confession of an incipient doubt; yet at the same time I say that
my mind is divided by that very deliberation, being influenced by the desire of describing
the glory, and restrained from speaking by the magnitude of the virtue (to be described);
since it is either not becoming to be silent, or it is perilous to say too little, save that to one
who is tossing in doubt this consideration alone is helpful, that it would appear easy for him
to be pardoned who has not feared to dare. Wherefore, beloved brethren, although my
mental capacity is burdened by the importance of the subject in such a way, that in proportion
as it puts itself forth in declaring the dignity of martyrdom, in that degree it is overwhelmed
by the very weight of the glory, and by its estimation of all those things concerning which,
when it speaks most, it fails, by its address being weakened, and broken, and self-entangled,
and does not with free and loosened reins display the might of such glory in the liberal eloquence
of discourse; yet, if I am not mistaken, some power there will be in my utterance,
which, when fortified by the appeal of the work itself, may here and there pour forth what
the unequal consciousness of my ability withheld from my words. Since, therefore, beloved
brethren, involved as we are in affairs so many and important, we are endeavouring with
all eagerness and labour to confirm the excellent and most beautiful issues of salvation, I
do not fear being so deterred by any slothful dread as to be withheld or rendered powerless;
<note type="footnote">4835 [Erasmus doubts as to the authorship, judging from the style. Pamelius is sure it is Cyprian’s.]</note>
<note type="footnote">4836 In place of reward, he sets before them not only security from the fear of Gehenna, but also the attainment
of everlasting life, describing both alternatives briefly in a poetical manner. He points out, that to some, martyrdom
serves as a crown, while to others who are baptized in their own blood, it serves as redemption. Finally, when
from the Scriptures he has stirred up his readers to confession of the name of Christ, he asks them to remember
him when the Lord begins to honour martyrdom in them, since the Lord is known not to deny such as they
when they ask Him for anything.</note>

<pb n="1413"/>
since, if any one should desire to look into that of which we are considering, the hope of
devotion being taken into account, and the very magnitude of the thing being weighed, he
would rather wonder that I could have dared at all, in a matter wherein both the vastness
of the subject oppressed me, and the earnestness of its own desire drove my mind, confused
with its joy, into mental difficulties. For who is there whom such a subject would not alarm?
who is there whom it would not overthrow with the fear of its own wonder!</p>
<p>2. For there is indeed, unless I am mistaken, even in the very power of conscience, a
marvellous fear which at once disturbs and inflames us; whose power, the more closely you
look into, the more the dreadful sense of its obligation is gathered from its very aspect of
venerable majesty. For assuredly you ought to consider what glory there is in expiating any
kind of defilement of life, and the foulness of a polluted body, and the contagions gathered
from the long putrefaction of vices, and the worldly guilt incurred by so great a lapse of
time, by the remedial agency of one stroke, whereby both reward may be increased, and
guilt may be excluded. Whence every perfection and condition of life is included in martyrdom.
This is the foundation of life and faith, this is the safeguard of salvation, this is the
bond of liberty and honour; and although there are also other means whereby the light may
be attained, yet we more easily arrive at nearness to the promised reward, by help of these
punishments, which sustain us.</p>
<p>3. For consider what glory it is to set aside the lusts of this life, and to oppose a mind
withdrawn from all commerce with nature and the world, to all the opposition of the adversary,
and to have no dread of the cruelty of the torturer; that a man should be animated
by the suffering whereby he might be believed to be destroyed, and should take to himself,
as an enhancement of his strength, that which the punisher thinks will aggravate his torments.
For although the hook, springing forth from the stiffening ribs, is put back again into the
wound, and with the repeated strokes of the whip the returning lash4837 is drawn away with
the rent portions of the flesh; still he stands immoveable, the stronger for his sufferings, re-
volving only this in his mind, that in that brutality of the executioners Christ Himself is
suffering4838 more in proportion to what he suffers. For since, if he should deny the Lord,
he would incur guilt on His behalf for whom he ought to have overcome, it is essential that
He should be seen to bear all things to whom the victory is due, even in the suffering.</p>
<p>4. Therefore, since martyrdom is the chief thing, there are three points arising out of it
on which we have proposed to ourselves to speak: What it is, how great it is, and of what
advantage it is. What, then, is martyrdom? It is the end of sins, the limit of dangers, the
guide of salvation, the teacher of patience, the home of life, on the journey to which those
<note type="footnote">4837 “Habena;” but according to Baluzius “avena,” “an oatstraw.”</note>
<note type="footnote">4838 [Acts ix. 5. The principle is recognised in the words, “Ye did it unto me,” where Christ identifies Himself
with members of His body. Oh, the condescension! Heb. ii. 11.]</note>

<pb n="1414"/>
things moreover befall which in the coming crisis might be considered torments. By this
also testimony is borne to the Name, and the majesty of the Name is greatly enhanced: not
that in itself that majesty can be diminished, or its magnitude detracted from, by the guilt
of one who denies it; but that it redounds to the increase of its glory, when the terror of the
populace that howls around is giving to suffering, fearless minds, and by the threats of
snarling hatred is adding to the title whereby Christ has desired to crown the man, that in
proportion as he has thought that he conquered, in that proportion his courage has grown
in the struggle. It is then, therefore, that all the vigour of faith is brought to bear, then facility
of belief is approved, when you encounter the speeches and the reproaches of the rabble,4839
and when you strengthen yourself by a religious mind against those madnesses of the
people,—overcoming, that is, and repelling whatever their blasphemous speech may have
uttered to wrong Christ in your person; as when the resisting breakwater repels the adverse
sea, although the waves dash and the rolling water again and again beats upon it, yet its
immoveable strength abides firm, and does not yield even when covered over by the waves
that foam around, until its force is scattered over the rocks and loses itself, and the conquered
billow lying upon the rocks retires forth into the open spaces of the shore.</p>
<p>5. For what is there in these speeches other than empty discourse, and senseless talk, and
a depraved pleasure in meaningless words? As it is written: “They have eyes, and they see
not; ears have they, and they hear not.”4840 “Their foolish heart is made sluggish, lest at
any time they should be converted, and I should heal them.”4841 For there is no doubt but
that He said this of all whose hardened mind and obstinate brutality of heart is always
driven away and repugnates from a vital devotion, folly leading them, madness dragging
them, in fine, every kind of ferocity enraging them, whereby they are instigated as well as
carried away, so that in their case their own deeds would be sufficient for their punishment,
their guilt would burden the very penalty of the persecution inflicted.</p>
<p>6. The whole of this tends to the praise of martyrdom, the whole illuminates the glory
of suffering wherein the hope of time future is beheld, wherein Christ Himself is engaged,
of whom are given the examples that we seek, and whose is the strength by which we resist.
And that in this behalf something is supplied to us to present, is surely a lofty and marvellous
condescension, and such as we are able neither mentally to conceive nor fully to express in
words. For what could He with His liberal affection bestow upon us more, than that He
should be the first to show forth in Himself what He would reward with a crown in others?
<note type="footnote">4839 [Ps. lxiv. 3. The revilings of the multitude are reckoned by the Psalmist among the most cruel tortures
of Christ; and we cannot doubt that the early Christians found the like cruelty of the heathen a daily martyrdom,

He became mortal that we might be immortal, and He underwent the issue of human destiny,
by whom things human are governed; and that He might appear to have given to us the
benefit of His having suffered, He gave us confession. He suggested martyrdoms; finally,
He, by the merits of His nativity, imputed all those things whereby the light (of life) may be
quenched, to a saving remedy, by His excellent humility, by His divine strength. Whoever
have deserved to be worthy of this have been without death, have overcome all the foulest
stains of the world, having subdued the condition of death.</p>
<p>7. For there is no doubt how much they obtain from the Lord, who have preferred God’s
name to their own safety, so that in that judgment-day their blood-shedding would make
them better, and the blood spilt would show them to be spotless. Because death makes life
more complete, death rather leads to glory. Thus, whenever on the rejoicing wheat-stalks
the ears of corn distended by rains grow full, the abundant harvests are forced4842 by the
summer; thus, as often as the vine is pruned by the knife from the tendrils that break forth
upon it, the bunch of grapes is more liberally clothed. For whatever is of advantage by its
injury turns out for the increase of the time to come; just as it has often been of avail to the
fields to let loose the flames, that by the heat of the wandering conflagration the blind
breathing-holes of the earth might be relaxed. It has been useful to parch the light stalks
with the crackling fire, that the pregnant corn-field might raise itself higher, and a more
abundant grain might flourish on the breeding stems. Therefore such also is first of all the
calamity, and by and by the fruit of martyrdom, that it so contemns death, that it may preserve
life in death.</p>
<p>8. For what is so illustrious and sublime, as by a robust devotion to preserve all the
vigour of faith in the midst of so many weapons of executioners? What so great and honourable,
as in the midst of so many swords of the surrounding guards, again and again to profess
in repeated words the Lord of one’s liberty and the author of one’s salvation?—and especially
if you set before your eyes that there is nothing more detestable than dishonour, nothing
baser than slavery, that now you ought to seek nothing else, to ask for nothing else, than
that you should be snatched from the slaughters of the world, be delivered from the ills of
the world, and be engaged only as an alien from the contagion of earth, among the ruins of
a globe that is speedily to perish? For what have you to do with this light, if you have the
promise of an eternal light? What interest have you in this commerce of life and nature, if
the amplitude of heaven is awaiting you? Doubtless let that lust of life keep hold, but let it
be of those whom for unatoned sin the raging fire will torture with eternal vengeance for
their crimes. Let that lust of life keep hold, but let it be of those to whom it is both a punishment
to die, and a torment to endure (after death). But to you both the world itself is subjected,
and the earth yields, if, when all are dying, you are reserved for this fate of being a
<note type="footnote">4842 “Coguntur,” or “coquuntur,”—“are matured.”</note>

<pb n="1416"/>
martyr. Do we not behold daily dyings? We behold new kinds of death of the body long
worn out with raging diseases, the miserable results of some plague hitherto unexperienced;
and we behold the destruction of wasted cities, and hence we may acknowledge how great
is to be considered the dignity of martyrdom, to the attainment of the glory of which even
the pestilence is beginning to compel us.4843</p>
<p>9. Moreover, beloved brethren, regard, I beseech you, this consideration more fully; for
in it both salvation is involved, and sublimity accounted of, although I am not unaware that
you abundantly know that we are supported by the judgments of all who stand fast, and
that you are not ignorant that this is the teaching handed down to us, that we should
maintain the power of so great a Name without any dread of the warfare; because we whom
once the desire of an everlasting remembrance has withheld from the longing for this light,
and whom the anticipations of the future have wrenched away, and whom the society of
Christ so longed for has kept aloof from all wickedness, shrink from offering our soul to
death except it be in the way of yielding to a mischief, and that those benefits of God must
no longer be retained and clung to by us, since beyond the burning up of these things the
reward is so great as that human infirmity can hardly attain sufficiently to speak of it.
Heaven lies open to our blood; the dwelling-place of Gehenna gives way to our blood; and
among all the attainments of glory, the title of blood is sealed as the fairest, and its crown
is designated as most complete.</p>
<p>10. Thus, whenever the soldier returns from the enemy laden with triumphant spoils,
he rejoices in his wounds. Thus, whenever the sailor, long harassed with tempests, arrives
at safe shores, he reckons his happiness by the dangers that he has suffered. For, unless I
am mistaken, that is assuredly a joyous labour whereby safety is found. Therefore all things
must be suffered, all things must be endured; nor should we desire the means of rejoicing
for a brief period, and being punished with a perpetual burning. For you ought to remember
that you are bound, as it were, by a certain federal paction, out of which arises the just condition
either of obtaining salvation, or the merited fearfulness of punishment. You stand
equally among adverse things and prosperous, in the midst of arms and darts; and on the
one hand, worldly ambition, on the other heavenly greatness, incites you.</p>
<p>11. If you fear to lose salvation, know that you can die; and, moreover, death should be
contemned by you, for whom Christ was slain. Let the examples of the Lords passion, I beseech
you, pass before your eyes; let the offerings, and the rewards, and the distinctions
prepared come together before you, and look carefully at both events, how great a difficulty
they have between them. For you will not be able to confess unless you know what a great

<pb n="1417"/>
mischief you do if you deny. Martyrs rejoice in heaven; the fire will consume those who are
enemies of the truth. The paradise of God blooms for the witnesses; Gehenna will enfold
the deniers, and eternal fire will burn them up. And, to say nothing of other matters, this
assuredly ought rather to urge us, that the confession of one word is maintained by the
everlasting confession of Christ; as it is written, “Whosoever shall confess me on earth before
men, him also will I confess before my Father, and before His angels.”4844 To this are added,
by way of an enhancement of glory, the adornments of virtue; for He says, “The righteous
shall shine as sparks that run to and fro among the stubble; they shall judge the nations, and
shall have dominion over the peoples.”4845</p>
<p>12. For it is a great glory, beloved brethren, to adorn the life of eternal salvation with
the dignity of suffering: it is a great sublimity before the face of the Lord, and under the gaze
of Christ, to contemn without a shudder the torments inflicted by human power. Thus
Daniel, by the constancy of his faith, overcame the threats of the king and the fury of raging
lions, in that he believed that none else than God was to be adored. Thus, when the young
men were thrown into the furnace, the fire raged against itself, because, being righteous,
they endured the flames, and guarded against those of Gehenna, by believing in God, whence
also they received things worthy of them: they were not delayed to a future time: they were
not reserved for the reward of eternal salvation. God saw their faith; that what they had
promised to themselves to see after their death, they merited to see in their body. For how
great a reward was given them in the present tribulation could not be estimated. If there
was cruelty, it gave way; if there was flame, it stood still. For there was one mind to all of
them, which neither violence could break down nor wrath could subvert; nor could the fear
of death restrain them from the obedience of devotion. Whence by the Lord’s grace it
happened, that in this manner the king himself appeared rather to be punished in those
men (who were slain), whilst they escape whom he had thought to slay.</p>
<p>13. And now, beloved brethren, I shall come to that point whence I shall very easily be
able to show you how highly the virtue of martyrdom is esteemed, which, although it is well
known to all, and is to be desired on account of the insignia of its inborn glory, yet in the
desire of its enjoyment has received more enhancement from the necessity of the times.
Because if any one be crowned at that season in which he supposes himself to be crowned,
if perchance he should die, he is greatly rewarded. Therefore, sublime and illustrious as
martyrdom is, it is the more needful now, when the world itself is turned upside down, and,
while the globe is partially shattered, failing nature is giving evidence of the tokens of its final
destruction. For the rain-cloud hangs over us in the sky, and the very air stretches forth the
mournful rain (curtain); and as often as the black tempest threatens the raging sea, the
<note type="footnote">4844 Luke xxii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">4845 Wisd. iii. 7.</note>

<pb n="1418"/>
glittering lightning-flashes glow terribly in the midst of the opening darkness of the clouds.
Moreover, when the deep is lashed into immense billows, by degrees the wave is lifted up,
and by degrees the foam whitens, until at length you behold it rush in such a manner, that
on those rocks on which it is hurled, it throws its foam higher than the wave that was vomited
forth by the swelling sea. You read that it is written, that we must pay even the uttermost
farthing. But the martyrs alone are relieved of this obligation; because they who trust to
their desires for eternal salvation, and have overcome their longings for this life, have been
made by the Lord’s precepts free from the universal suffering.4846 Therefore from this especially,
beloved brethren, we shall be able to set forth what great things the virtue of martyrdom
is able to fulfil.</p>
<p>14. And, to pass over everything else, we ought to remember what a glory it is to come
immaculate to Christ—to be a sharer in His suffering, and to reign in a perpetual eternity
with the Lord—to be free from the threatening destruction of the world, and not to be mixed
up with the bloody carnage of wasting diseases in a common lot with others; and, not to
speak of the crown itself, if, being situated in the midst of these critical evils of nature, you
had the promise of an escape from this life, would you not rejoice with all your heart? If, I
say, while tossing amid the tempests of this world, a near repose should invite you, would
you not consider death in the light of a remedy? Thus, surrounded as you are with the knives
of the executioners, and the instruments of testing tortures, stand sublime and strong, considering
how great is the penalty of denying, in a time when you are unable to enjoy, the
world for the sake of which you would deny, because indeed the Lord knew that cruel torments
and mischievous acts of punishment would be armed against us for our destruction,
in order that He might make us strong to endure them all. “My son,” says He, “if thou come
to serve God, stand fast in righteousness, and fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.”4847
Moreover, also, the blessed Apostle Paul exclaimed, and said, “To me to live is Christ, and
to die is gain.”4848</p>
<p>15. Wherefore, beloved brethren, with a firm faith, with a robust devotion, with a virtue
opposed to the fierce threatenings of the world, and the savage murmurs of the attending
crowds, we must resist and not fear, seeing that ours is the hope of eternity and heavenly
life, and that our ardour is inflamed with the longing for the light, and our salvation rejoices
in the promise of immortality. But the fact that our hands are bound with tightened bonds,
and that heavy links fastened round our necks oppress us with their solid weight, or that
our body strained on the rack hisses on the red-hot plates, is not for the sake of seeking our

blood, but for the sake of trying us.4849 For in what manner should we be able to recognise
even the dignity of martyrdom, if we were not constrained to desire it, even at the price of
the sacrifice of our body? I indeed have known it, and I am not deceived in the truth of what
I say, when the cruel hands of the persecutors were wrenching asunder the martyr’s limbs,
and the furious torturer was ploughing up his lacerated muscles, and still could not overcome
him. I have known it by the words of those who stood around.4850 “This is a great matter.
Assuredly I know not what it is—that he is not subdued by suffering, that he is not broken
down by wearing torments.” Moreover, there were other words of those who spoke: “And
yet I believe he has children: for he has a wife associated with him in his house; and yet he
does not give way to the bond of his offspring, nor is he withdrawn by the claim of his
family affection from his stedfast purpose. This matter must be known, and this strength
must be investigated, even to the very heart; for that is no trifling confession, whatever it
may be, for which a man suffers, even so as to be able to die.”</p>
<p>16. Moreover, beloved brethren, so great is the virtue of martyrdom, that by its means
even he who has wished to slay you is constrained to believe. It is written, and we read:
“Endure in suffering, and in thy humiliation have patience, because gold and silver are tried
by the fire.”4851 Since, therefore, the Lord proves us by earthly temptations, and Christ the
Judge weighs us by these worldly ills, we must congratulate ourselves, and rejoice that He
does not reserve us for those eternal destructions, but rejoices over us as purged from all
contagion. But from those whom He adopts as partners of His inheritance, and is willing
to receive into the kingdom of heaven, what else indeed does He ask than a walk in integrity?
He Himself has said that all things are His, both those things which are displayed upon the
level plains, and which lift themselves up into sloping hills; and moreover, whatever the
greatness of heaven surrounds, and what the gliding water embraces in the circumfluent
ocean. But if all things are within His ken, and He does not require of us anything but sincere
actions, we ought, as He Himself has said, to be like to gold. Because, when you behold in
the glistening ore4852 the gold glittering under the tremulous light, and melting into a liquid
form by the roaring flames (for this also is generally the care of the workmen), whenever
from the panting furnaces is vomited forth the glowing fire, the rich flame is drawn away
from the access of the earth in a narrow channel, and is kept back by sand from the refluent
masses of earth. Whence it is necessary to suffer all things, that we may be free from all

wickedness, as He has said by His prophet: “And though in the sight of men they have
suffered torments, yet is their hope full of immortality; and being vexed in a few things, they
shall be well rewarded in many things, because God has tried them, and has found them
worthy of Himself, and has received them as a sacrifice of burnt-offering.”4853</p>
<p>17. But if ambitious dignity deter you, and the amount of your money heaped up in
your stores influence you—a cause which ever distracts the intentions of a virtuous heart,
and assails the soul devoted to its Lord with a fearful trembling—I beg that you would again
refer to the heavenly words. For it is the very voice of Christ who speaks, and says, “Whosoever
shall lose his life for my name’s sake, shall receive in this world a hundred fold, and
in the world to come shall possess eternal life.”4854 And we ought assuredly to reckon
nothing greater, nothing more advantageous, than this. For although in the nature of your
costly garments the purple dye flows into figures, and in the slackening threads the gold
strays into a pattern, and the weighty metals to which you devote yourselves are not wanting
in your excavated treasures; still, unless I am mistaken, those things will be esteemed vain
and purposeless, if, while all things else are added to you, salvation alone is found to be
wanting; even as the Holy Spirit declares that we can give nothing in exchange for our soul.
For He says, “If you should gain the whole world, and lose your own soul, what shall it profit
you, or what exchange shall a man give for his soul?”4855 For all those things which we behold
are worthless, and such as resting on weak foundations, are unable to sustain the weight of
their own mass. For whatever is received from the world is made of no account by the antiquity
of time. Whence, that nothing should be sweet or dear that might be preferred to
the desires of eternal life, things which are of personal right and individual law are cut off
by the Lord’s precepts; so that in the undergoing of tortures, for instance, the son should
not soften the suffering father, and private affection should not change the heart that was
previously pledged to enduring strength, into another disposition. Christ of His own right
ordained that truth and salvation alone must be embraced in the midst of great sufferings,
under which wife, and children, and grandchildren, under which all the offspring of one’s
bowels, must be forsaken, and the victory be claimed.</p>
<p>18. For Abraham also thus pleased God, in that he, when tried by God, spared not even
his own son, in behalf of whom perhaps he might have been pardoned had he hesitated to
slay him. A religious devotion armed his hands; and his paternal love, at the command of
the Lord who bade it, set aside all the feelings of affection. Neither did it shock him that he
was to shed the blood of his son, nor did he tremble at the word; nevertheless for him Christ
had not yet been slain. For what is dearer than He who, that you might not sustain anything

<pb n="1421"/>
unwillingly in the present day, first of all Himself suffered that which He taught others to
suffer? What is sweeter than He who, although He is our God and Lord, nevertheless makes
the man who suffers for His sake His fellow-heir in the kingdom of heaven? Oh grand—I
know not what!—whether that reason scarcely bears to receive that consciousness, although
it always marvels at the greatness of the rewards; or that the majesty of God is so abundant,
that to all who trust in it, it even offers those things which, while we were considering what
we have done, it had been sin to desire. Moreover, if only eternal salvation should be given,
for that very perpetuity of living we should be thankful. But now, when heaven and the
power of judging concerning others is bestowed in the eternal world, what is there wherein
man’s mediocrity may not find itself equal to all these trials? If you are assailed with injuries,
He was first so assailed. If you are oppressed with reproaches, you are imitating the experience
of God. Whence also it is but a little matter whatever you undergo for Him, seeing that you
can do nothing more, unless that in this consists the whole of salvation, that He has promised
the whole to martyrdom. Finally, the apostle, to whom all things were always dear, while
he deeply marvelled at the greatness of the promised benefits, said, “I reckon that the sufferings
of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory that is to follow, which
shall be revealed in us.”4856 Because he was musing in his own mind how great would be
the reward, that to him to whom it would be enough to be free from death, should be given
not only the prerogative of salvation, but also to ascend to heaven: to heaven which is not
constrained into darkness, even when light is expelled from it, and the day does not unfold
into light by alternate changes; but the serene temperature of the liquid air unfolds a pure
brightness through a clearness that reddens with a fiery glow.</p>
<p>19. It now remains, beloved brethren, that we are bound to show what is the advantage
of martyrdom, and that we should teach that especially, so that the fear of the future may
stimulate us to this glorious title. Because those to whom great things are promised, seem
to have greater things which they are bound to fear. For the soldier does not arouse himself
to arms before the enemy have brandished their hostile weapons; nor does a man withdraw
his ship in an anchorage, unless the fear of the deep have checked his courage. Moreover
also, while eager for his wealth, the considerate husbandman does not stir up the earth with
a fortunate ploughshare, before the crumbling glebe is loosened into dust by the rain that
it has received. Thus this is the natural practice of every man, to be ignorant of what is of
advantage, unless you recognise what has been mischievous. Whence also a reward is given
to all the saints, in that the punishment of their deeds is inflicted on the unrighteous.
Therefore what the Lord has promised to His people is doubtful to none, however ignorant
he is; but neither is there any doubt what punitive fires He threatens. And since my discourse
<note type="footnote">4856 Rom. viii. 18.</note>

<pb n="1422"/>
has led me thus to argue about both these classes of things in a few words, as I have already
spoken of both, I will briefly explain them.</p>
<p>20. A horrible place, of which the name is Gehenna, with an awful murmuring and
groaning of souls bewailing, and with flames belching forth through the horrid darkness of
thick night, is always breathing out the raging fires of a smoking furnace, while the confined
mass of flames is restrained or relaxed for the various purposes of punishment. Then there
are very many degrees of its violence, as it gathers into itself whatever tortures the consuming
fire of the heat emitted can supply. Those by whom the voice of the Lord has been rejected,
and His control contemned, it punishes with different dooms; and in proportion to the
different degree of deserving of the forfeited salvation it applies its power, while a portion
assigns its due distinction to crime. And some, for example, are bowed down by an intolerable
load, some are hurried by a merciless force over the abrupt descent of a precipitous path,
and the heavy weight of clanking chains bends over them its bondage. Some there are, also,
whom a wheel is closely turning, and an unwearied dizziness tormenting; and others whom,
bound to one another with tenacious closeness, body clinging to body compresses: so that
both fire is devouring, and the load of iron is weighing down, and the uproar of many is
torturing.</p>
<p>21. But those by whom God has always been sought or known, have never lost the position
which Christ has given them, where grace is found, where in the verdant fields the
luxuriant earth clothes itself with tender grass, and is pastured with the scent of flowers;
where the groves are carried up to the lofty hill-top, and where the tree clothes with a
thicker foliage whatever spot the canopy, expanded by its curving branches, may have shaded.
There is no excess of cold or of heat, nor is it needed that in autumn the fields should rest,
or, again in the young spring, that the fruitful earth should bring forth. All things are of one
season: fruits are borne of a continued summer, since there neither does the moon serve
the purpose of her months, nor does the sun run his course along the moments of the hours,
nor does the banishment of the light make way for night. A joyous repose possesses the
people, a calm home shelters them, where a gushing fountain in the midst issues from the
bosom of a broken hollow, and flows in sinuous mazes by a course deep-sounding, at intervals
to be divided among the sources of rivers springing from it. Here there is the great praise
of martyrs, here is the noble crown of the victors, who have the promise of greater things
than those whose rewards are more abundant. And that either their body is thrown to wild
beasts, or the threatening sword is not feared, is shown as the reason of their dignity, is
manifested as the ground of their election. Because it would have been inconsistent, that he
who had been judged equal to such a duty, should be kept among earthly vices and corruptions.</p>
<p>22. For you deserve, O excellent martyrs, that nothing should be denied to you who are
nourished with the hope of eternity and of light; whose absolute devotion, and whose mind

<pb n="1423"/>
dedicated to the service of heaven, is evidently seen. Deservedly, I say deservedly, nothing
to you is forbidden to wish for, since by your soul this world is looked down upon, and the
alienated appearance of the time has made you to shudder, as if it were a confused blindness
of darkness; to whom this world is always regarded in the light of a dungeon, its dwellings
for restraints, in a life which has always been esteemed by you as a period of delay on a
journey. Thus, indeed, in the triumph of victory he is snatched from these evils, whom no
vain ambition with pompous step has subdued, nor popular greatness has elated, but whom,
burning with heavenly desire, Christ has added to His kingdom.</p>
<p>23. There is nothing, then, so great and venerable as the deliverance from death, and
the causing to live, and the giving to reign for ever. This is fitting for the saints, needful for
the wretched, pleasing to all, in which the good rejoice, the abject are lifted up, the elect are
crowned. Assuredly God, who cares for all, gave to life a certain medicine as it were in
martyrdom, when to some He assigned it on account of their deserving, to others He gave
it on account of His mercy. We have assuredly seen very many distinguished by their faith,
come to claim this illustrious name, that death might ennoble the obedience of their devotion.
Moreover, also, we have frequently beheld others stand undismayed, that they might redeem
their sins committed, and be regarded as washed in their gore by His blood; and so being
slain they might live again, who when alive were counted slain. Death assuredly makes life
more complete, death finds the glory that was lost. For in this the hope once lost is regained,
in this all salvation is restored. Thus, when the seed-times shall fail on the withering plains,
and the earth shall be parched with its dying grass, the river has delighted to spring forth
from the sloping hills, and to soothe the thirsty fields with its gushing streams, so that the
vanquished poverty of the land might be dissolved into fruitful wheat-stems, and the cornfield
might bristle up the thicker for the counterfeited showers of rain.</p>
<p>24. What then, beloved brethren, shall I chiefly relate, or what shall I say? When all
dignified titles thus combine in one, the mind is confused, the perception is misled; and in
the very attempt to speak with brilliancy, my unworthy discourse vanishes away. For what
is there to be said which can be sufficient, when, if you should express the power of eternal
salvation, its attending glories come in your way; if you would speak of its surroundings,
its greatness prevents you? The things at the same time are both in agreement and in opposition,
and there is nothing which appears worthy to be uttered. Thus the instances of martyrdom
have held in check the impulses of daring speech, as if entangled and ensnared by
an opponent. What voice, what lungs, what strength, can undertake to sustain the form of
such a dignity? At the confession of one voice, adverse things give way, joyous things appear,
kingdoms are opened, empires are prepared, suffering is overcome, death is subdued, life
is preferred, and the resisting weapons of a mischievous enemy are broken up. If there is
sin, it perishes; if there is crime, it is left behind. Wherefore I beseech you, weigh this in
your minds, and from my address receive so much as you know that you can feel.</p>

<pb n="1424"/>
<p>25. Let it present itself to your eyes, what a day that is, when, with the people looking
on, and all men watching, an undismayed devotion is struggling against earthly crosses and
the threats of the world; how the minds in suspense, and hearts anxious about the tremblings
of doubt, are agitated by the dread of the timid fearfulness of those who are congratulating
them! What an anxiety is there, what a prayerful entreaty, what desires are recorded, when,
with the victory still wavering, and the crown of conquest hanging in doubt over the head
while the results are still uncertain, and when that pestilent and raving confession is inflamed
by passion, is kindled by madness, and finally, is heated by the fury of the heart, and by
gnashing threats! For who is ignorant how great a matter this is, that our, as it were, despised
frailty, and the unexpected boldness of human strength, should not yield to the pangs of
wounds, nor to the blows of tortures,—that a man should stand fast and not be moved,
should be tortured and still not be overcome, but should rather be armed by the very suffering
whereby he is tormented?</p>
<p>26. Consider what it is, beloved brethren: set before your perceptions and your minds
all the endurance of martyrdom. Behold, indeed, in the passion of any one you will, they
who are called martyrs rejoice as being already summoned out of the world; they rejoice as
being messengers of all good men; they rejoice in like manner as elected. Thus the Lord rejoices
in His soldier,4857 Christ rejoices in the witness to His name. It is a small matter that
I am speaking of, beloved brethren; it is a small matter, so great a subject in this kind of
address, and so marvellous a difficulty has been undertaken by me; but let the gravity of the
issue, I beseech you, not be wanting for my own purpose, knowing that as much can be said
of martyrdom as could be appreciated. Whence also this alone has been the reason of my
describing its glory, not that I judged myself equal and fitted for its praise, but that I saw
that there was such a virtue in it, that however little I might say about it, I should profess
that I had said as much as possible. For although the custody of faith may be preferred to
the benefit of righteousness, and an immaculate virginity may recognise itself as better than
the praises of all; yet it is necessary that even it should give place to the claim of blood, and
be made second to a gory death. The former have chosen what is good, the latter have imitated
Christ.</p>
<p>27. But now, beloved brethren, lest any one should think that I have placed all salvation
in no other condition than in martyrdom, let him first of all look especially at this, that it is
not I who seem to speak, that am of so great importance, nor is the order of things so arranged
that the promised hope of immortality should depend on the strength of a partial advocacy.
But since the Lord has testified with His own mouth, that in the Father’s possession are
many dwellings, I have believed that there is nothing greater than that glory whereby those
<note type="footnote">4857 [The adoption of “the sign of the cross,” after the immersion of baptism, is referable to this martyr-age.
It was meant to impress the idea of soldiership.]</note>

<pb n="1425"/>
men are proved who are unworthy of this worldly life. Therefore, beloved brethren, striving
with a religious rivalry, as if stirred up with some incentive of reward, let us submit to all
the abundance and the endurance of strength. For things passing away ought not to move
us, seeing that they are always being pressed forward to their own overthrow, not only by
the law proposed to them, but even by the very end of time. John exclaims, and says, “Now
is the axe laid to the root of the tree;”4858 showing, to wit, and pointing out that it is the last
old age of all things. Moreover, also, the Lord Himself says, “Walk while ye have the light,
lest the darkness lay hold upon you.”4859 But if He has foretold that we must walk in that
time, certainly He shows that we must at any rate walk.</p>
<p>28. And to return to the praise of martyrdom, there is a word of the blessed Paul, who
says: “Know ye not that they who run in a race strive many, but one receiveth the prize?
But do ye so run, that all of you may obtain.”4860 Moreover also elsewhere, that he may
exhort us to martyrdom, he has called us fellow-heirs with Christ; nay, that he might omit
nothing, he says, “If ye are dead with Christ, why, as if living in the world, do ye make distinctions?”
4861 Because, dearest brethren, we who bear the rewards of resurrection, who
seek for the day of judgment, who, in fine, are trusting that we shall reign with Christ, ought
to be dead to the world. For you can neither desire martyrdom till you have first hated the
world, nor attain to God’s reward unless you have loved Christ. And he who loves Christ
does not love the world. For Christ was given up by the world, even as the world also was
given up by Christ; as it is written, “The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.”4862
The world has been an object of affection to none whom the Lord has not previously condemned;
nor could he enjoy eternal salvation who has gloried in the life of the world. That
is the very voice of Christ, who says: “He that loveth his life in this world, shall lose it in the
world to come; but he that hateth his life in this world, shall find it in the world to come.”4863
Moreover, also, the Apostle Paul says: “Be ye imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.”4864
And the same elsewhere says: “I wish that all of you, if it were possible, should be imitators
of me.”4865</p>
<p>29. He said this who suffered, and who suffered for this cause, that he might imitate the
Lord; and assuredly he wished us also to suffer for this cause, that through him we might

imitate Christ. If thou art righteous, and believest in God, why fearest thou to shed thy blood
for Him whom thou knowest to have so often suffered for thee? In Isaiah He was sawn
asunder, in Abel He was slain, in Isaac He was offered up, in Joseph He was sold into slavery,
in man He was crucified. And I say nothing of other matters, such as neither my discourse
is able to tell nor my mind to bear. My consciousness is overcome by the example of His
humility; and when it considers what things befell when He suffered, it marvels that He
should suffer on whose behalf all things quaked. The day fled into the night; the light gave
up all things into darkness; and, its mass being inclined backwards and forwards, the whole
earth was jarred, and burst open; the dead4866 were disturbed, the graves were laid bare,
and as the tombs gaped open into the rent of the earth, bodies returning to the light were
restored; the world trembled at the flowing of His blood; and the veil which hung from the
opening of the temple was rent, and all the temple uttered a groan. For which cause it is a
great matter to imitate Him who, in dying, convicted the world. Therefore when, after the
example of the Lord’s passion, and after all the testimony of Christ, you lay down your life,
and fear not to shed your blood, everything must absolutely give way to martyrdom. Inestimable
is the glory of martyrdom, infinite its measure, immaculate its victory, invaluable
its title, immense its triumph; because he who is presented to Him with the special glory of
a confessor, is adorned with the kindred blood of Christ.</p>
<p>30. Therefore, beloved brethren, although this is altogether of the Lord’s promise and
gift, and although it is given from on high, and is not received except by His will, and
moreover, can neither be expressed in words nor described by speech, nor can be satisfied
by any kind of powers of eloquence, still such will be your benevolence, such will be your
charity and love, as to be mindful of me when the Lord shall begin to glorify martyrdom in
your experience. That holy altar4867 encloses you within itself, that great dwelling-place of
the venerable Name encloses you within itself, as if in the folds of a heart’s embrace: the
powers of the everlasting age sustain you, and that by which you shall ever reign and shall
ever conquer. O blessed ones! and such as truly have your sins remitted, if, however, you
who are Christ’s peers ever have sinned!4868 O blessed ones! whom the blood of the Lord
has dyed from the beginning of the world, and whom such a brightness of snowy clothing
has deservedly invested, and the whiteness of the enfolding robe has adorned! Finally, I
myself seem to myself to behold already, and, as far as is possible to the mind of man, that
divine and illustrious thing occurs to my eyes and view. I seem, I say to myself, already to
behold, that that truly noble army accompanies the glory and the path of their Christ. The

<head>Of the Discipline and Advantage of Chastity.4870</head>
<p>1. I do not conceive that I have exceeded any portions of my duty, in always striving as
much as possible, by daily discussions of the Gospels, to afford to you from time to time the
means of growth, by the Lord’s help, in faith and knowledge. For what else can be effected
in the Lord’s Church with greater advantage, what can be found more suitable to the office
of a bishop, than that, by the teaching of the divine words, recommended and commented
on by Him, believers should be enabled to attain to the promised kingdom of heaven? This
assuredly, as the desired result day by day of my work as well as of my office, I endeavour,
notwithstanding my absence, to accomplish; and by my letters I try to make myself present
to you, addressing you in faith, in my usual manner, by the exhortations that I send you. I
call upon you, therefore, to be established in the power of the Root4871 of the Gospel, and
to stand always armed against all the assaults of the devil. I shall not believe myself to be
absent from you, if I shall be sure of you. Nevertheless, everything which is advantageously
set forth, and which either defines or promises the condition of eternal life to those who are
investigating it, is then only profitable, if it be aided in attaining the reward of the effort by
the power of the divine mercy. We not only set forth words which come from the sacred
fountains of the Scriptures, but with these very words we associate prayers to the Lord, and
wishes, that, as well to us as to you, He would not only unfold the treasures of His sacraments,
but would bestow strength for the carrying into act of what we know. For the danger is all
the greater if we know the Lord’s will, and loiter in the work of the will of God.</p>
<p>2. Although, therefore, I exhort you always, as you are aware, to many things, and to
the precepts of the Lord’s admonition—for what else can be desirable or more important
to me, than that in all things you should stand perfect in the Lord?—yet I admonish you,
that you should before all things maintain the barriers of chastity, as also you do: knowing
that you are the temple of the Lord, the members of Christ, the habitation of the Holy
Spirit, elected to hope, consecrated to faith, destined to salvation, sons of God, brethren of
Christ, associates of the Holy Spirit, owing nothing any longer to the flesh, as born again of
water, that the chastity, over and above the will, which we should always desire to be ours,
may be afforded to us also, on account of the redemption, that that which has been consecrated
by Christ might not be corrupted. For if the apostle declares the Church to be the
spouse of Christ, I beseech you consider what chastity is required, where the Church is given
in marriage as a betrothed virgin. And I indeed, except that I have proposed to admonish
you with brevity, think the most diffuse praises due, and could set forth abundant laudations
<note type="footnote">4870 [Not reckoned by Erasmus as worthy of Cyprian. Pamelius thinks otherwise.]</note>
<note type="footnote">4871 [This illustrates pp. 322 and 389, note 7.]</note>

<pb n="1429"/>
of chastity; but I have thought it superfluous to praise it at greater length among those who
practise it. For you adorn it while you exhibit it; and in its exercise you set forth its more
abundant praises, being made its ornament, while it also is yours, each lending and borrowing
honour from the other. It adds to you the discipline of good morals; you confer upon it the
ministry of saintly works. For how much and what it can effect has on the one hand been
manifest by your means, and on the other it has shown and taught what you are wishing
for,—the two advantages of precepts and practice being combined into one, that nothing
should appear maimed, as would be the case if either principles were wanting to service, or
service to principles.</p>
<p>3. Chastity is the dignity of the body, the ornament of morality, the sacredness of the
sexes, the bond of modesty, the source of purity, the peacefulness of home, the crown of
concord.4872 Chastity is not careful whom it pleases but itself. Chastity is always modest,
being the mother of innocency; chastity is ever adorned with modesty alone, then rightly
conscious of its own beauty if it is displeasing to the wicked. Chastity seeks nothing in the
way of adornments: it is its own glory. It is this which commends us to the Lord, unites us
with Christ; it is this which drives out from our members all the illicit conflicts of desire,
instils peace into our bodies: blessed itself, and making those blessed, whoever they are, in
whom it condescends to dwell. It is that which even they who possess it not can never accuse;
it is even venerable to its enemies, since, they admire it much more because they are unable
to capture it. Moreover, as mature, it is both always excellent in men, and to be earnestly
desired by women; so its enemy, unchastity, is always detestable, making an obscene sport
for its servants, sparing neither bodies nor souls. For, their own proper character being
overcome, it sends the entire man under its yoke of lust, alluring at first, that it may do the
more mischief by its attraction,—the foe of continency, exhausting both means and modesty;
the perilous madness of lust frequently attaining to the blood, the destruction of a good
conscience, the mother of impenitence, the ruin of a more virtuous age, the disgrace of one’s
race, driving away all confidence in blood and family, intruding one’s own children upon
the affections of strangers, interpolating the offspring of an unknown and corrupted stock
into the testaments of others. And this also, very frequently burning without reference to
sex, and not restraining itself within the permitted limits, thinks it little satisfaction to itself,
unless even in the bodies of men it seeks, not a new pleasure, but goes in quest of extraordinary
and revolting extravagances, contrary to nature itself, of men with men.</p>
<p>4. But chastity maintains the first rank in virgins, the second in those who are continent,
the third in the case of wedlock. Yet in all it is glorious, with all its degrees. For even to
maintain the marriage-faith is a matter of praise in the midst of so many bodily strifes; and
to have determined on a limit in marriage defined by continency is more virtuous still, be-

<pb n="1430"/>
cause herein even lawful things are refused.4873 Assuredly to have guarded one’s purity from
the womb, and to have kept oneself an infant even to old age throughout the whole of life,
is certainly the part of an admirable virtue; only that if never to have known the body’s seductive
capacities is the greater blessedness, to have overcome them when once known is
the greater virtue; yet still in such a sort that that virtue comes of God’s gift, although it
manifests itself to men in their members.</p>
<p>5. The precepts of chastity, brethren, are ancient. Wherefore do I say ancient? Because
they were ordained at the same time as men themselves. For both her own husband belongs
to the woman, for the reason that besides him she may know no other; and the woman is
given to the man for the purpose that, when that which had been his own had been yielded
to him, he should seek for nothing belonging to another.4874 And in such wise it is said,
“Two shall be in one flesh,”4875 that what had been made one should return together, that
a separation without return should not afford any occasion to a stranger. Thence also the
apostle declares that the man is the head of the woman, that he might commend chastity in
the conjunction of the two. For as the head cannot be suited to the limbs of another, so also
one’s limbs cannot be suited to the head of another: for one’s head matches one’s limbs, and
one’s limbs one’s head; and both of them are associated by a natural link in mutual concord,
lest, by any discord arising from the separation of the members, the compact of the divine
covenant should be broken. Yet he adds, and says: “Because he who loves his wife, loves
himself. For no one hates his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ the
Church.”4876 From this passage there is great authority for charity with chastity, if wives
are to be loved by their husbands even as Christ loved the Church and wives ought so to
love their husbands also as the Church loves Christ.</p>
<p>6. Christ gave this judgment when, being inquired of, He said that a wife must not be
put away, save for the cause of adultery; such honour did He put upon chastity. Hence arose
the decree: “Ye shall not suffer adulteresses to live.”4877 Hence the apostle says: “This is the
will of God, that ye abstain from fornication.”4878 Hence also he says the same thing: “That
the members of Christ must not be joined with the members of an harlot.”4879 Hence the

man is delivered over unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, who, treading under foot
the law of chastity, practises the vices of the flesh. Hence with reason adulterers do not attain
the kingdom of heaven. Hence it is that every sin is without the body, but that the adulterer
alone sins against his own body. Hence other authoritative utterances of the instructor, all
of which it is not necessary at this time to collect, especially among you, who for the most
part know and do them; and you cannot find cause for complaint concerning these things,
even though they are not described. For the adulterer has not an excuse, nor could he have,
because he might take a wife.</p>
<p>7. But as laws are prescribed to matrons, who are so bound that they cannot thence be
separated, while virginity and continency are beyond all law, there is nothing in the laws of
matrimony which pertains to virginity; for by its loftiness it transcends them all. If any evil
undertakings of men endeavour to transcend laws, virginity places itself on an equality with
angels; moreover, if we investigate, it even excels them, because struggling in the flesh it
gains the victory even against a nature which angels have not. What else is virginity than
the glorious preparation for the future life? Virginity is of neither sex. Virginity is the continuance
of infancy. Virginity is the triumph over pleasures. Virginity has no children; but
what is more, it has contempt for offspring: it has not fruitfulness, but neither has it bereavement;
blessed that it is free from the pain of bringing forth, more blessed still that it is free
from the calamity of the death of children. What else is virginity than the freedom of liberty?
It has no husband for a master. Virginity is freed from all affections: it is not given up to
marriage, nor to the world, nor to children. It cannot dread persecution, since it cannot
provoke it from its security.</p>
<p>8. But since the precepts of chastity have thus briefly been set forth to us, let us now give
an instance of chastity. For it is more profitable when we come in the very presence of the
thing; nor will there be any doubt about the virtue, when that which is prescribed is also
designated by illustrations. The example of chastity begins with Joseph. A Hebrew youth,
noble by his parentage, nobler by his innocence, on account of the envy excited by his revelations
exposed for sale by his brethren to the Israelites, had attained to the household of
a man of Egypt. By his obedience and his innocence, and by the entire faithfulness of his
service, he had aroused in his favour the easy and kindly disposition of his master; and his
appearance had commended itself to all men, alike by his gracious speech as by his youthfulness.
But that same nobility of manner was received by his master’s wife in another
manner than was becoming; in a secret part of the house, and without witnesses,—a place
high up, and fitted for deeds of wickedness, the unrestrained unchastity of the woman
thought that it could overcome the youth’s chastity, now by promises, now by threats. And
when he was restrained from attempting flight by her holding his garments, shocked at the

<pb n="1432"/>
audacity of such a crime, tearing his very garments, and able to appeal to the sincerity of
his naked body as a witness of his innocence, the rash woman did not shrink from adding
calumny to the crime of her unchastity. Dishevelled, and raging that her desire should be
despised, she complained both to others and to her husband that the Hebrew youth had
attempted to use that force to her which she herself had striven to exercise.4880 The husband’s
passion, unconscious of the truth, and terribly inflamed by his wife’s accusation, is aroused;
and the modest youth, because he did not defile his conscience with the crime, is thrust into
the lowest dungeon of the prison. But chastity is not alone in the dungeon; for God is with
Joseph, and the guilty are given into his charge, because he had been guiltless. Moreover,
he dissolves the obscurities of dreams, because his spirit was watchful in temptations, and
he is freed from chains by the master of the prison. He who had been an inferior in the house
with peril, was made lord of the palace without risk; restored to his noble station, he received
the reward of chastity and innocence by the judgment of God, from whom he had deserved
it.</p>
<p>9. But not less from a different direction arises to us another similar instance of chastity
from the continence of women. Susanna, as we read, the daughter of Chelcias, the wife of
Joachim, was exceedingly beautiful—more beautiful still in character. Her outward appearance
added no charm to her, for she was simple: chastity had cultivated her; and in addition
to chastity nature alone. With her, two of the elders had begun to be madly in love, mindful
of nothing, neither of the fear of God, nor even of their age, already withering with years.
Thus the flame of resuscitated lust recalled them into the glowing heats of their bygone
youth. Robbers of chastity, they profess love, while they really hate. They threaten her with
calumnies when she resists; the adulterers in wish declare themselves the accusers of adultery.
And between these rocks of lust she sought help of the Lord, because she was not equal to
prevailing against them by bodily strength. And the Lord heard from heaven chastity crying
to Him; and when she, overwhelmed with injustice, was being led to punishment, she was
delivered, and saw her revenge upon her enemies. Twice victorious, and in her peril so often
and so fatally hedged in, she escaped both the lust and death. It will be endless if I continue
to produce more examples; I am content with these two, especially as in these cases chastity
has been defended with all their might.</p>
<p>10. The memory of noble descent could not enervate them, although to some this is a
suggestive licence to lasciviousness; nor the comeliness of their bodies, and the beauty of
their well-ordered limbs, although for the most part this affords a hint, that being, as it were,
the short-lived flower of an age that rapidly passes away, it should be fed with the offered
opportunity of pleasure; nor the first years of a green but mature age, although the blood,
still inexperienced, grows hot, and stimulates the natural fires, and the blind flames that stir
<note type="footnote">4880 “Irrogare.”</note>

<pb n="1433"/>
in the marrow, to seek a remedy, even if they should break forth at the risk of modesty; nor
any opportunity afforded by secrecy, or by freedom from witnesses, which to some seems
to ensure safety, although this is the greatest temptation to the commission of crime, that
there is no punishment for meditating it. Neither was a necessity laid upon them by the
authority of those who bade them yield, and in the boldness of association and companionship,
by which kind of temptations also righteous determinations are often overcome.
Neither did the very rewards nor the kindliness, nor did the accusations, nor threats, nor
punishments, nor death, move them; nothing was counted so cruel, so hard, so distressing,
as to have fallen from the lofty stand of chastity. They were worthy of such a reward of the
Divine Judge, that one of them should be glorified on a throne almost regal; that the other,
endowed with her husband’s sympathy, should be rescued by the death of her enemies.
These, and such as these, are the examples ever to be placed before our eyes, the like of them
to be meditated on day and night.</p>
<p>11. Nothing so delights the faithful soul as the healthy consciousness of an unstained
modesty.4881 To have vanquished pleasure is the greatest pleasure; nor is there any greater
victory than that which is gained over one’s desires. He who has conquered an enemy has
been stronger, but it was stronger than another; he who has subdued lust has been stronger
than himself. He who has overthrown an enemy has beaten a foreign foe; he who has cast
down desire has vanquished a domestic adversary. Every evil is more easily conquered than
pleasure; because, whatever it is, the former is repulsive, the latter is attractive. Nothing is
crushed with such difficulty as that which is armed by it. He who gets rid of desires has got
rid of fears also; for from desires come fears. He who overcomes desires, triumphs over sin;
he who overcomes desires, shows that the mischief of the human family lies prostrate under
his feet; he who has overcome desires, has given to himself perpetual peace; he who has
overcome desires, restores to himself liberty,—a most difficult matter even for noble natures.
Therefore we should always meditate, brethren, as these matters teach us, on chastity. That
it may be the more easy, it is based upon no acquired skill. For the right will that is therein
carried to perfection—which, were it not checked, is remote (scil. from our consciousness)—is
still our will; so that it is not a will to be acquired, but that which is our own is to be cherished.
4882</p>
<note type="footnote">4881 [Tertullian, vol. iv. pp. 74, 97, etc.]</note>
<note type="footnote">4882 This passage is allowed by all to be corrupt. If we were to punctuate differently, to insert “nisi” before
“consummata,” and change “longe est” into “non deesset,” we get the following sense: “Therefore we should
always meditate, brethren, on chastity, as circumstances teach us, that it may be more easy for us. It depends
on no arts; for what is it but perfected will, which, if it were not checked, would certainly not fail to arise? And
it is our own will, too: therefore it has not to be acquired, but we have to cherish what is already our own.”</note>

<pb n="1434"/>
<p>12. For what is chastity but a virtuous mind added to watchfulness over the body; so
that modesty observed in respect of the sexual relations, attested by strictness (of demeanour),
should maintain honourable faith by an uncorrupted offspring? Moreover, to chastity,
brethren, are suited and are known first of all divine modesty, and the sacred meditation of
the divine precepts, and a soul inclined to faith, and a mind attuned to the sacredness of
religion: then carefulness that nothing in itself should be elaborated beyond measure, or
extended beyond propriety; that nothing should be made a show of, nothing artfully coloured;
that there should be nothing to pander to the excitement or the renewal of wiles. She is not
a modest woman who strives to stir up the fancy of another, even although her bodily chastity
be preserved. Away with such as do not adorn, but prostitute their beauty. For anxiety about
beauty is not only the wisdom of an evil mind, but belongs to deformity. Let the bodily
nature be free, nor let any sort of force be intruded upon God’s works. She is always wretched
who is not satisfied to be such as she is. Wherefore is the colour of hair changed? Why are
the edges of the eyes darkened? Why is the face moulded by art into a different form? Finally,
why is the looking-glass consulted, unless from fear lest a woman should be herself?
Moreover, the dress of a modest woman should be modest; a believer should not be conscious
of adultery even in the mixture of colours. To wear gold in one’s garments is as if it were
desirable to corrupt one’s garments. What do rigid metals do among the delicate threads of
the woven textures, except to press upon the enervated shoulders, and unhappily to show
the extravagance of a boastful soul? Why are the necks oppressed and hidden by outlandish
stones, the prices of which, without workmanship, exceed the entire fortune4883 of many a
one? It is not the woman that is adorned, but the woman’s vices that are manifested. What,
when the fingers laden with so much gold can neither close nor open, is there any advantage
sought for, or is it merely to show the empty parade of one’s estate? It is a marvellous thing
that women, tender in all things else, in bearing the burden of their vices are stronger than
men.</p>
<p>13. But to return to what I began with: chastity is ever to be cultivated by men and women;
it is to be kept with all watchfulness within its bounds. The bodily nature is quickly
endangered in the body, when the flesh, which is always falling, carries it away with itself.
Because under the pretext of a nature which is always urging men to desires whereby the
ruins of a decayed race are restored, deceiving with the enticement of pleasure, it does not
lead its offspring to the continence of legitimate intercourse, but hurls them into crime.
Therefore, in opposition to these fleshly snares, by which the devil both obtrudes himself
<note type="footnote">4883 [“Kalendarium cujusvis excedunt.” The kalendaria were tablets of monthly accounts, in which the
monthly interest due, etc., were set down. “Exceed the entire monthly income” would be better. Tertullian uses

<pb n="1435"/>
as a companion and makes himself a leader, we must struggle with every kind of strength.
Let the aid of Christ be appropriated, according to the apostle, and let the mind be withdrawn
as much as possible from the association of the body; let consent be withheld from the body;
let vices be always chastised, that they may be hated; let that misshapen and degraded shame
which belongs to sin be kept before our eyes. Repentance itself, with all its struggles, is a
discreditable testimony to sins committed. Let not curiosity be indulged in scanning other
people’s countenances. Let one’s speech be brief, and one’s laughter moderate, for laughter
is the sign of an easy and a negligent disposition; and let all contact, even that which is becoming,
be avoided.4884 Let no indulgence be permitted to the body, when bodily vice is to
be avoided. Let it be considered how honourable it is to have conquered dishonour, how
disgraceful to have been conquered by dishonour.</p>
<p>14. It must be said, moreover, that adultery is not pleasure, but mutual contempt; nor
can it delight, because it kills both the soul and modesty. Let the soul restrain the provocations
of the flesh; let it bridle the impulses of the body. For it has received this power, that the
limbs should be subservient to its command; and as a lawful and accomplished charioteer,
it should turn about the fleshly impulses when they lift themselves above the allowed limits
of the body, by the reins of the heavenly precepts, lest that chariot of the body, carried away
beyond its limits, should hurry into its own peril the charioteer himself as well as it. But in
the midst of these things, nay, before these things, in opposition to disturbances and all
vices, help must be sought for from the divine camp; for God alone, who has condescended
to make men, is powerful also to afford sufficient help to men. I have composed a few words,
because I did not propose to write a volume, but to send you an address. Look ye to the
Scriptures; seek out for yourselves from those precepts greater illustrations of this matter.4885

When I shall say to the righteous, Thou shalt surely live; but4918 he will trust to his
own righteousness, and will do iniquity: all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered;
in his iniquity which he has done, in that he shall die. And when I shall say to the wicked,
Thou shalt surely die, and he turns himself from his sin, and doeth righteousness and
judgment, and restoreth to the debtor his pledge, and giveth back his robbery, and walketh
in the precepts of life, that he may do no iniquity, he shall surely live, and shall not die; none
of his sins which he hath sinned shall be stirred up against him: because he hath done justice
and judgment, he shall live in them.”4919</p>
<p>Also in the same: “I am the Lord, because I bring low the high tree, and exalt the low
tree, and dry up the green tree, and cause the dry tree to flourish.”4920</p>
<p>Also in the same: “And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel, Even as ye have
spoken, saying, Our errors and our iniquities are in us, and we waste away in them, and
how shall we live? Say unto them, I live, saith the Lord: if I will the death of a sinner, only
let him turn from his way, and he shall live.”4921</p>

wasted places.”4922</p>
<p>Also in the same: “And the wicked man, if he turn himself from all his iniquities that
he has done, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, and mercy,

membrance; in his righteousness which he hath done he shall live. Do I willingly desire the
death of the unrighteous man, saith Adonai the Lord, rather than that he should turn him
from his evil way, that he should live?”4923</p>

<p>Also in Micah: “Alas for me, O my soul, because truth has perished from the earth, and
among all there is none that correcteth; all judge in blood. Every one treadeth down his
neighbour with tribulation; they prepare their hands for evil.”4927</p>
<p>Also in the same: “Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy, because I have fallen, but I
shall arise: because although I shall sit in darkness, the Lord will give me light: I will bear
the Lord’s anger, because I have sinned against Him, until He justify my cause.”4928</p>
<p>Also in Zephaniah: “Come ye together and pray, O undisciplined people; before ye be
made as a flower that passeth away, before the anger of the Lord come upon you, before the
day of the Lord’s fury come upon you, seek ye the Lord, all ye humble ones of the earth; do
judgment and seek justice, and seek for gentleness; and answer ye to Him that ye may be
protected in the day of the Lord’s anger.”4929</p>
<p>Also in Zechariah: “Be ye converted unto me, and I will be turned unto you.”4930</p>
<p>Also in Hosea: “Be thou converted, O Israel, to the Lord thy God, because thou art
weakened by thine iniquities. Take many with you, and be converted to the Lord your God;
worship Him, and say, Thou art mighty to put away our sins; that ye may not receive iniquity,

<p>Also in Ecclesiasticus: “Be thou turned to the Lord, and forsake thy sins, and exceedingly
hate cursing, and know righteousness and God’s judgments, and stand in the lot of the
propitiation of the Most High: and go into the portion of life with the living, and those that
make confession. Delay not in the error of the wicked. Confession perisheth from the dead
man, as if it were nothing. Living and sound, thou shalt confess to the Lord, and thou shalt

<p>I.
(Maintained by consent, and caressed by excuses, p. 557.)</p>
<p>The severer discipline of early Christianity must not be discarded by those who claim
it for the canon of Scripture; for modes of baptism, confirmation, and other rites; for Church
polity, in short; and for the Christian year. Let us note that the whole spirit of antiquity is
opposed to worldliness. It reflects the precept, “Be not conformed to this world,” and in
nothing more emphatically than in hostility to theatrical amusements, which in our days
are re-asserting the deadly influence over Christians which Cyprian and Tertullian and
other Fathers so solemnly denounced. If they were “maintained by consent, and caressed
by excuses,” even in the martyr-age, no wonder that in our Laodicean period they baffle all
exertions of faithful watchmen, who enforce the baptismal vow against “pomps and vanities,”
always understood of theatrical shows, and hence part of that “world, the flesh, and the
devil” which Christians have renounced.</p>

<p>II.
(Now is the axe laid to the root, p. 586.)</p>
<p>Matt. iii. 10. “Securis ad radicem arboris posita est,” says Cyprian, quoting the Old Latin,
with which the Vulgate substantially agrees.4943 A very diligent biblical scholar directs attention
to the vulgar abuse of this saying,4944 which turns upon a confusion of the active
verb to lay, with the neuter verb to lie.4945 It is quoted as if it read, Lay the axe to the root,
and is “interpreted, popularly, as of felling a tree, an incumbrance or a nuisance.…Hence
it often makes radical reformers in Church and State, and becomes the motto of many a
reckless leader whose way has been to teach, not upward by elevating the ignoble, but
downward by sinking the elevated.…There is something similar in Latin: jacio to hurl; and
jaceo, to lie, recline, or remain at rest. Beza follows the Vulgate (posita est); but the original
<note type="footnote">4943 It has arborum, however, instead of the singular.</note>

is clear,—κεῖται,4946 is laid, or lieth.…It means, The axe is ready; it lieth near the root, in
mercy and in menace.…The long-suffering of God waiteth as in the days of Noah…waiteth,
i.e., for good fruit.”</p>
<p>Compare Luke xiii. 9: “If it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it
down.” Such is the argument of Cyprian, in view of the approaching “end of time.”</p>
 
<p>III.
(General Note.)</p>
<p>Let me here call attention to the mischievous use of words common among modern
Latins, even the best of them. Thus, Pellicia4947 mentions Cyprian as referring his synodical
judgment to “the supreme chair of the Church of Rome.” No need to say that his reference
proves nothing of the kind. “Supremacy,” indeed! Consult Bossuet and the Gallicans on
that point, even after Trent. The case cited is evidence of the very reverse. Cyprian and his
Carthaginian colleagues wished, also, the conspicuous co-operation of their Italian brethren;
and so he writes to “Cornelius, our colleague,” who, “with very many comprovincial bishops,
having held a council, concurred in the same opinion.” It is an instance of fraternal concurrence
on grounds of entire equality; and Cyprian’s courteous invitation to his “colleague”
Cornelius and his comprovincials to co-operate, is a striking illustration of the maxim,
“Totus apellandus sit orbis, ubi totum orbem causa spectat.” Compare St. Basil’s letters to
the Western bishops, in which he reminds them that the Gospel came to them from the
East. This is a sort of primacy recognised by St. Paul himself,4948 as it was afterwards, when
Jerusalem was recognised as “the mother of all the churches”4949 by a general council,
writing to Damasus, bishop of Rome, himself.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice
to
Caius, Presbyter of Rome.</head>
<p>[a.d. 180–217.] During the episcopate of Zephyrinus, Caius, one of his presbyters, acquired
much credit by his refutation of Proclus, a Montanist. He became known as an eloquent
and erudite doctor, and to him has often been ascribed the Philosophumena of Hippolytus,
and also The Labyrinth. He wrote in Greek, and finally seems to have been promoted
to an episcopal See, possibly among the Easterns.4950 To him also has been ascribed the
celebrated “Muratorian Canon,” which is therefore given in this volume, with other fragments
less dubiously associated with his name. He has been supposed by some to have been a pupil
of Irenæus, but of this there is no conclusive evidence. If his reputation suffers somewhat
from his supposed rejection of the Apocalypse, it is apologized for by Wordsworth, in a
paragraph that deserves to be quoted entire: “Let it be remembered that the church of Rome
was not eminent for learning at that time. It was induced, by fear of erroneous consequences,
to surrender another canonical book,—the Epistle to the Hebrews. The learning of the
Church was then mainly in the East. It was by the influence of the East, in the West, that
the church of Rome was enabled to recover that epistle. It was also the influence of the
Apocalyptic churches of Asia that preserved the Apocalypse as an inspired work of St. John
to the church of Rome.” By the deference with which the author of the Refutation speaks of
the Apocalypse, we are able, among other evidences, to decide that it is not the work of
Caius.</p>
<p>In an interesting chapter of his Hippolytus, Bishop Wordsworth considers the possibility
of the authorship of that work as his, and discusses it with ability and learning. Nearly all
that is known or conjectured concerning Caius is there condensed and elucidated. But
Lardner devotes a yet more learned chapter to him; and to that the inquirer is referred, as
a sufficient elucidation of all that was known or conjectured about him before the present
century. He is quoted by Eusebius;4951 and the traveller is reminded, when he visits the
<note type="footnote">4950 The ingenious conjecture of Wordsworth, who surmises that καὶ ἐθνῶν ἐπίσκοπον, in Photius, should

and learned notes, see Routh, Reliquæ Sacræ, ii. p. 127.</note>
<note type="footnote">4951 Eusebius quotes him in several places (book ii. cap. xxv., book iii. capp. xxviii. and xxxi.), and cites him
in proof that St. Peter suffered on the Vatican, and St. Paul on the Via Ostiensis. See Lardner, Credib., vol. ii. pp.

gorgeous Church of St. Paul on the Ostian Road, that so early an author as Caius may be
cited as evidence that it probably stands very near the spot where St. Paul fulfilled his
prophecy, “I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.” We can
only conjecture the time of his birth by the age he must have attained in the time of
Zephyrinus; but of his death, the secret is with the Master in whom he believed, as we may
trust, until he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Here follows, from the Edinburgh series, the learned editor’s Introductory Notice:—</p>
<p>Eusebius states that Caius lived in the time of Zephyrinus.4952 He speaks of him as a
member of the Catholic Church,4953 and as being most learned. And he mentions that a
dialogue of his was extant in his time, in which he argued with Proclus, the leader of the
Cataphrygian heresy; and that Caius in this dialogue spoke of only thirteen epistles of the
Apostle Paul, “not counting the Epistle to the Hebrews with the rest.”4954</p>
<p>Eusebius mentions no other work of Caius. He makes extracts from a work against the
heresy of Artemon in the fifth book of his Ecclesiastical History, but he states distinctly that
the work was anonymous. He evidently did not know who was the author. Theodoret and
Nicephorus affirm that the work from which Eusebius made these extracts bore the title of
The Little Labyrinth. Photius has the following notice of Caius: “Read the work of Josephus
on the universe, bearing in some manuscripts the inscription On the Cause of the Universe,
and in others, On the Substance of the Universe.…But I found that this treatise is not the
work of Josephus, but of one Gaius a presbyter, who lived in Rome, who they say composed
The Labyrinth also, and whose dialogue with Proclus, the champion of the Montanistic
heresy, is in circulation.…They say also that he composed another treatise specially directed
against the heresy of Artemon.”4955 Photius here ascribes four works to Caius: 1. On the
Universe; 2. The Labyrinth; 3. The Dialogue between himself and Proclus; 4. The Treatise
against the Heresy of Artemon. He does not say that he read any of them but the first. This
treatise is now assigned to Hippolytus. The information of Photius in regard to the other
three, derived as it is from the statements of others, cannot be trusted.</p>

<head>Note by the American Editor.</head>
<p>It is to be observed that the Fragment of Muratori proves that the Apocalypse was received
in the church at Rome in the times of Pius, a.d. 160. It is quoted in Hermas freely. Also, see

the Epistle of Roman clergy to Cyprian (p. 303, note 5, supra), about a.d. 250. But the Fragment
aforesaid is the earliest direct evidence on the subject. Note, that its author says, “We
receive the Apocalypse,” etc. “Some amongst us will not have,” etc. (see p. 602, infra). Thus,
the comprovincials have a voice, as in the cases cited by Hippolytus. See (pp. 157, 159,
supra) Elucidations VI. and XI. The Bishop of Rome seems, by this Fragment, to have received
the Apocalypse of Peter (Eusebius, H. E., book iii. cap. 25), but it was thrown out as spurious
by the Church nevertheless.</p>

(In Eusebius’ Eccl. Hist., v. 28.)</p>
<p>For they say that all those of the first age, and the apostles themselves, both received
and taught those things which these men now maintain; and that the truth of Gospel
preaching was preserved until the times of Victor, who was the thirteenth bishop in Rome
from Peter, and that from his successor Zephyrinus the truth was falsified. And perhaps
what they allege might be credible, did not the Holy Scriptures, in the first place, contradict
them. And then, besides, there are writings of certain brethren older than the times of
Victor, which they wrote against the heathen in defence of the truth, and against the heresies
of their time: I mean Justin and Miltiades, and Tatian and Clement, and many others, in all
which divinity is ascribed to Christ. For who is ignorant of the books of Irenæus and Melito,
and the rest, which declare Christ to be God and man? All the psalms, too, and hymns4962
of brethren, which have been written from the beginning by the faithful, celebrate Christ
the Word of God, ascribing divinity to Him. Since the doctrine of the Church, then, has
been proclaimed so many years ago, how is it possible that men have preached, up to the
time of Victor, in the manner asserted by these? And how are they not ashamed to utter
these calumnies against Victor, knowing well that Victor excommunicated Theodotus the
tanner,4963 the leader and father of this God-denying apostasy, who first affirmed that Christ
was a mere man? For if, as they allege, Victor entertained the very opinions which their
blasphemy teaches, how should he have cast off Theodotus, the author of this heresy?</p>

<p>II.
(In Eusebius, as above.)</p>
<p>I shall, at any rate, remind many of the brethren of an affair that took place in our own
time,—an affair which, had it taken place in Sodom, might, I think, have been a warning

even to them. There was a certain confessor, Natalius,4964 who lived not in distant times,
but in our own day. He was deluded once by Asclepiodotus, and another Theodotus, a
banker. And these were both disciples of Theodotus the tanner, the first who was cut off
from communion on account of this sentiment, or rather senselessness, by Victor, as I said,
the bishop of the time.4965 Now Natalius was persuaded by them to let himself be chosen4966
bishop of this heresy, on the understanding that he should receive from them a salary of a
hundred and fifty denarii a month. Connecting himself, therefore, with them, he was on
many occasions admonished by the Lord in visions. For our merciful God and Lord Jesus
Christ was not willing that a witness of His own sufferings should perish, being without the
Church. But as he gave little heed to the visions, being ensnared by the dignity of presiding
among them, and by that sordid lust of gain which ruins very many, he was at last scourged
by holy angels, and severely beaten through a whole night, so that he rose early in the
morning, and threw himself, clothed with sackcloth and covered with ashes, before
Zephyrinus the bishop, with great haste and many tears, rolling beneath the feet not only
of the clergy, but even of the laity, and moving the pity of the compassionate Church of the
merciful Christ by his weeping. And after trying many a prayer, and showing the weals left
by the blows which he had received, he was at length with difficulty admitted to communion.</p>

their impiety.4968 And should any one lay before them a word of divine Scripture, they examine
whether it will make a connected or disjoined form of syllogism;4969 and leaving the

Holy Scriptures of God, they study geometry, as men who are of the earth, and speak of the
earth, and are ignorant of Him who cometh from above. Euclid, indeed, is laboriously
measured4970 by some of them, and Aristotle and Theophrastus are admired; and Galen,4971
forsooth, is perhaps even worshipped by some of them. But as to those men who abuse the
arts of the unbelievers to establish their own heretical doctrine, and by the craft of the impious
adulterate the simple faith of the divine Scriptures, what need is there to say that these are
not near the faith? For this reason is it they have boldly laid their hands upon the divine
Scriptures, alleging that they have corrected them. And that I do not state this against them
falsely, any one who pleases may ascertain. For if any one should choose to collect and
compare all their copies together, he would find many discrepancies among them. The
copies of Asclepiades,4972 at any rate, will be found at variance with those of Theodotus.
And many such copies are to be had, because their disciples were very zealous in inserting
the corrections, as they call them, i.e., the corruptions made by each of them. And again,
the copies of Hermophilus do not agree with these; and as for those of Apollonius,4973 they
are not consistent even with themselves. For one may compare those which were formerly
prepared by them4974 with those which have been afterwards corrupted with a special object,
and many discrepancies will be found. And as to the great audacity implied in this offence,
it is not likely that even they themselves can be ignorant of that. For either they do not believe
that the divine Scriptures were dictated by the Holy Spirit, and are thus infidels; or they
think themselves wiser than the Holy Spirit, and what are they then but demoniacs? Nor
can they deny that the crime is theirs, when the copies have been written with their own
hand; nor4975 did they receive such copies of the Scriptures from those by whom they were
first instructed in the faith, and they cannot produce copies from which these were transcribed.
And some of them did not even think it worth while to corrupt them; but simply
denying the law and the prophets for the sake of their lawless and impious doctrine, under
pretexts of grace, they sunk down to the lowest abyss of perdition.4976</p>

Gospel, that according to Luke, the well-known physician Luke wrote in his own name4979
in order after the ascension of Christ, and when Paul had associated him with himself4980
as one studious of right.4981 Nor did he himself see the Lord in the flesh; and he, according
as he was able to accomplish it, began4982 his narrative with the nativity of John. The fourth
Gospel is that of John, one of the disciples. When his fellow-disciples and bishops entreated
him, he said, “Fast ye now with me for the space of three days, and let us recount to each
other whatever may be revealed to each of us.” On the same night it was revealed to Andrew,
one of the apostles, that John should narrate all things in his own name as they called them
to mind.4983 And hence, although different points4984 are taught us in the several books of
the Gospels, there is no difference as regards the faith of believers, inasmuch as in all of
them all things are related under one imperial Spirit,4985 which concern the Lord’s nativity,
His passion, His resurrection, His conversation with His disciples, and His twofold advent,—
the first in the humiliation of rejection, which is now past, and the second in the
<note type="footnote">4977 An acephalous fragment on the canon of the sacred Scriptures, ascribed by some to Caius. This very
important fragment [vol. ii. pp. 4 and 56, this series] was discovered by Muratori in the Ambrosian Library at
Milan, and published by him in his Antiquitates Italicæ in 1740. This manuscript belongs to the seventh or
eighth century. Muratori ascribed it to Caius, Bunsen to Hegesippus; but there is no clue whatever to the authorship.
From internal evidence the writer of the fragment is believed to belong to the latter half of the second
century. The fragment has been much discussed. For a full account of it, see Westcott’s General Survey of the
History of the Canon of the New Testament, 2d ed. p. 184 ff., and Tregelles’ Canon Muratorianus; [also Routh,
Rel., i. pp. 394–434].</note>
<note type="footnote">4978 The text is, “quibus tamen interfuit et ita posuit.” Westcott omits the “et.” Bunsen proposes “ipse

glory of royal power, which is yet in the future. What marvel is it, then, that John brings
forward these several things4986 so constantly in his epistles also, saying in his own person,
“What we have seen with our eyes, and heard with our ears, and our hands have handled,
that have we written.”4987 For thus he professes himself to be not only the eye-witness, but
also the hearer; and besides that, the historian of all the wondrous facts concerning the Lord
in their order.</p>
<p>2. Moreover, the Acts of all the Apostles are comprised by Luke in one book, and addressed
to the most excellent Theophilus, because these different events took place when
he was present himself; and he shows this clearly—i.e., that the principle on which he wrote
was, to give only what fell under his own notice—by the omission4988 of the passion of Peter,
and also of the journey of Paul, when he went from the city—Rome—to Spain.</p>
<p>3. As to the epistles4989 of Paul, again, to those who will understand the matter, they
indicate of themselves what they are, and from what place or with what object they were
directed. He wrote first of all, and at considerable length, to the Corinthians, to check the
schism of heresy; and then to the Galatians, to forbid circumcision; and then to the Romans
on the rule of the Old Testament Scriptures, and also to show them that Christ is the first
object4990 in these;—which it is needful for us to discuss severally,4991 as the blessed Apostle
Paul, following the rule of his predecessor John, writes to no more than seven churches by
name, in this order: the first to the Corinthians, the second to the Ephesians, the third to
the Philippians, the fourth to the Colossians, the fifth to the Galatians, the sixth to the
Thessalonians, the seventh to the Romans. Moreover, though he writes twice to the Corinthians
and Thessalonians for their correction, it is yet shown—i.e., by this sevenfold writing—
that there is one Church spread abroad through the whole world. And John too, indeed,
in the Apocalypse, although he writes only to seven churches, yet addresses all. He wrote,
besides these, one to Philemon, and one to Titus, and two to Timothy, in simple personal
affection and love indeed; but yet these are hallowed in the esteem of the Catholic Church,
and in the regulation of ecclesiastical discipline. There are also in circulation one to the
Laodiceans, and another to the Alexandrians, forged under the name of Paul, and addressed
against the heresy of Marcion; and there are also several others which cannot be received
into the Catholic Church, for it is not suitable for gall to be mingled with honey.</p>

Rome, while his brother bishop Pius sat in the chair of the Church of Rome. And therefore
it also ought to be read; but it cannot be made public4994 in the Church to the people, nor

note of the Edinburgh editor,4996 which is found on p. 156 of vol. ix. in that series: “From
this it appears that it was a very ancient custom in the Church to compose hymns and psalms
in honour of Christ. Pliny, in his letter to Trajan, also states that the Christians were accustomed
to meet together and sing hymns to Christ.4997 Hippolytus also may be understood
to refer to these hymns and psalms towards the close of his oration on the end of the
world,4998 where he says: ‘Your mouth I made to give glory and praise, and to utter psalms
and spiritual songs.’ A hymn of this kind in honour of Jesus Christ, composed by Clement

<head>NOVATIAN.</head>
<p>[Translated by the Rev. Robert Ernest Wallis.]</p>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="1458"/>
<head>Introductory Notice
to
Novatian, a Roman Presbyter.</head>
<p>[a.d. 210–280.] When we reflect upon the history of Solomon, and his marvellous contributions
to the sacred canon of Scripture, we must not be surprised to find a Tatian, a
Tertullian, and a Novatian among the Fathers. We deplore the lapse of such characters, but
after death they are not subject to human judgment. Let us cherish the gratitude we owe to
them for their good works, and use their testimony so far as it was faithful; covering their
shame with the mantle of charity, and praying for grace never to imitate their faults. “If any
teacher have wandered from the faith, it is permitted,” says St. Vincent of Lerins5000, “by
Divine Providence for our trial, whether we love God or not, with all our heart and with all
our soul.”</p>
<p>We find Novatian apparently exercising jurisdiction, sede vacante, in Rome, with his
co-presbyters, and as vicar-general (to use a later term) corresponding with Cyprian. This
was about a.d. 250, after the death of Fabian. His marked abilities and real services had fitted
him to preside thus over the Roman presbytery, and to be their “secretary for foreign affairs.”
But he laboured under the impediment of clinic baptism, and had not an unblemished record,
if we credit Eusebius,5001 in his conduct during persecution.</p>
<p>He was not called, therefore, to the episcopate. Cornelius was made bishop June 4, a.d.
251; and, apparently, disappointed ambition soon bore its thorny fruits. “Emulation of the
episcopal office is the mother of schisms,” said Tertullian;5002 even in that period when to
be a bishop was so often to be a martyr. And we find Novatian grasping a shadowy titular
bishopric, which, wholly irregular and universally disowned, could have been to such a man
the source of nothing but misery. I say, “to such a man,” for, without hearing the other side,
I cannot accept what was unquestionably supposed to be fact amid the excitements of the
times. And Novatian was not a common or a vulgar character. The arguments of Lardner5003
teach us at least to be Christians,—to accept the facts, but “forbear to judge,” seeing, as that

writer observes, “we have not one remaining line of his in self-defence or against his adversaries.”</p>
<p>Now as to his orthodoxy, so far as his extant writings are concerned, I think any scholar,
not anxious to make out a case, will abide by the candid judgment of Bull, who defends his
reputation against Petavius.5004 “By no means,” he says, “should we tolerate that injustice
of the Jesuit Petau towards the ancient writers, against their manifest mind and purpose;
twisting, as he everywhere does, their sound and Catholic sayings into a sense alien and
heretical.”</p>
<p>The work upon the Trinity, which is a most valuable contribution to ante-Nicene
theology, is said by Cave to have been written about a.d. 257; and that upon the Jewish meats
seems to have been composed during the Decian persecution. His heresy, such as it was,
turned upon unrelenting discipline, and was a sin against charity, which is greater than faith
itself. It violated the “seventy times seven” maxim of our Lord, and the comprehensive
precept, “Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.” It wounded Christian unity at a perilous period,
and when every breach in the wall of the fold was sure to let in the wolves.</p>
<p>“He may have aspired to the papal chair,” says a contemporary writer5005 of no mean
repute, adding, “to which he had the best claim.” Then he says, “Novatian was elected antipope
by a minority, and consecrated by three Italian bishops.” Is this history? What impression
must it give to the young student? The learned writer whom I quote shows clearly
enough that there was no “papacy” in primitive times, as that word is universally understood.
Why, then, put a face upon Antiquity so utterly misleading? Neither Novatian, nor his
consecrators, nor Cornelius, against whom he rebelled, ever dreamed of anything more than
of an episcopal chair; venerable, indeed, for its succession of pastors from the times of SS.
Peter and Paul, but as yet hardly felt in the Christian brotherhood; which for two centuries
had produced many pious but few eminent men, and in which Novatian himself was the
earliest contributor to the “Latin Christianity,” already founded and flourishing, not in Italy,
but in Northern Africa.</p>
<p>The following is the Introductory Notice of the Edinburgh translator, the Rev. Dr.
Wallis, who, I am glad to observe, is tender towards our author’s memory:—</p>
<p>The biography of Novatian belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the third century. He
was, or is reputed to have been, the founder of a sect which claimed for itself the name of
“Puritan”5006 (καθαροί). For a long time he was in determined opposition to Cornelius,
bishop of Rome, in regard to the admission of the lapsed and penitent into the Church; but
the facts of the controversy and much of our information in regard to Novatian are to be

got only from his enemies, the Roman bishop and his adherents. Accordingly, some have
believed all the accusations that have been brought against him, while others have been inclined
to doubt them all.5007</p>
<p>It is not known where Novatian was born. Some have appealed to Philostorgius5008 in
behalf of the opinion that he was a Phrygian; but others maintain that, supposing this to be
a statement of the historian, it is a mere conjecture of his, based on the character of Novatian’s
teaching. It is also stated by Cyprian, that he was a Stoic before he passed over to the
Christian Church; but this also has been doubted. While amongst the catechumens, he was
seized by a violent disease, attributed to demoniac agency; and, being near death, he received
baptism. He was ordained presbyter by Fabian, bishop of Rome, against the wishes of the
rest of the clergy, who objected thereto because he had received clinic baptism.5009 The
subsequent circumstances of his schism and his contest with Cornelius, are stated at length
with no friendly spirit in a letter to Antonianus by Cyprian.5010 Socrates5011 states that he
suffered martyrdom; but his authority, amid the silence of all others, is not sufficient to
guarantee the fact.</p>
<p>Novatian composed many works. The following are extant:—</p>
<p>I. De Trinitate, formerly attributed by some to Tertullian, by others to Cyprian; but now
on all hands allowed to be the work of Novatian, to whom Jerome expressly assigns it.5012
It was written after the heresy of Sabellius, which appeared 256 a.d.</p>
<p>II. De Cibis Judaicis: at first also attributed by some to Tertullian or Cyprian; but now
assigned to Novatian on the testimony of Jerome. It was written during the time of the Decian
persecution, about 250 a.d.</p>
<p>III. Novatian was the author of the letter5013 addressed by the Roman clergy to Cyprian.
So Cyprian himself states.5014 Some have also attributed to him Ep. xxix. without any authority.</p>

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>Novatian’s treatise concerning the Trinity is divided into thirty-one chapters. He first
of all, from chapter first to the eighth, considers those words of the Rule of Truth or Faith,5015
which bid us believe on God the Father and Lord Almighty, the absolutely perfect Creator
of all things. Wherein among the other divine attributes he moreover ascribes to Him,
partly from reason and partly from the Holy Scriptures, immensity, eternity, unity, goodness,
immutability, immortality, spirituality; and adds that neither passions nor members can be
attributed to God, and that these things are only asserted of God in Scripture anthropopathically.
5016</p>
<note type="footnote">5015 Which we call the Creed.</note>
<note type="footnote">5016 From the ninth chapter to the twenty-eighth he enters upon the diffuse explanation also of those words
of our creed which commend to us faith in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the Lord our God, the Christ promised
in the Old Testament, and proves by the authority of the old and new covenant that He is very man and very
God. In chapter eighteenth he refutes the error of the Sabellians, and by the authority of the sacred writings he
establishes the distinction of the Father and of the Son, and replies to the objections of the above-named heresiarchs
and others. In the twenty-ninth chapter he treats of faith in the Holy Spirit, saying that finally the authority
of the high admonishes us, after the Father and the Son, to believe also on the Holy Spirit, whose operations he
recounts and proves from the Scriptures. He then labours to associate the unity of God with the matters previously
contended for, and at length sets forth the sum of the doctrines above explained. [Anthropopathy, see cap. v. p.

<head>Chapter I. Argument.—Novatian, with the View of Treating of the Trinity, Sets Forth
from the Rule of Faith that We Should First of All Believe in God the Father and
Lord Omnipotent, the Absolute Founder of All Things. The Works of Creation
are Beautifully Described. Man’s Free-Will is Asserted; God’s Mercy in Inflicting
Penalty on Man is Shown; The Condition After Death of the Souls of the Righteous
and Unrighteous is Determined.</head>
<p>The Rule of truth requires that we should first of all things believe on God the Father
and Lord Omnipotent; that is, the absolutely perfect Founder of all things, who has suspended
the heavens in lofty sublimity, has established the earth with its lower mass, has diffused
the seas with their fluent moisture, and has distributed all these things, both adorned and
supplied with their appropriate and fitting instruments. For in the solid vault of heaven He
has both awakened the light-bringing Sunrisings; He has filled up the white globe of the
moon in its monthly5017 waxings as a solace for the night; He, moreover, kindles the starry
rays with the varied splendours of glistening light; and He has willed all these things in their
legitimate tracks to circle the entire compass of the world, so as to cause days, months, years,
signs, and seasons, and benefits of other kinds for the human race. On the earth, moreover,
He has lifted up the loftiest mountains to a peak, He has thrown down valleys into the depths,
He has smoothly levelled the plains, He has ordained the animal herds usefully for the
various services of men. He has also established the oak trees of the woods for the future
benefit of human uses. He has developed the harvests into food. He has unlocked the mouths
of the springs, and has poured them into the flowing rivers. And after these things, lest He
should not also provide for the very delights of the eyes, He has clothed all things with the
various colours of the flowers for the pleasure of the beholders. Even in the sea itself,
moreover, although it was in itself marvellous both for its extent and its utility, He has made
manifold creatures, sometimes of moderate, sometimes of vast bodily size, testifying by the
variety of His appointment to the intelligence of the Artificer. And, not content with these
things, lest perchance the roaring and rushing waters should seize upon a foreign element
at the expense of its human possessor, He has enclosed its limits with shores;5018 so that
when the raving billow and the foaming water should come from its deep bosom, it should
return again unto itself, and not transgress its concealed bounds, but keep its prescribed
laws, so that man might the rather be careful to observe the divine laws, even as the elements

world, and man, too, made in the image of God, to whom He imparted mind, and reason,
and foresight, that he might imitate God; and although the first elements of his body were

earthly, yet the substance was inspired by a heavenly and divine breathing. And when He
had given him all things for his service, He willed that he alone should be free. And lest,
again, an unbounded freedom should fall into peril, He laid down a command, in which
man was taught that there was no evil in the fruit of the tree; but he was forewarned that
evil would arise if perchance he should exercise his free will, in the contempt of the law that
was given. For, on the one hand, it had behoved him to be free, lest the image of God should,
unfittingly be in bondage; and on the other, the law was to be added, so that an unbridled
liberty might not break forth even to a contempt of the Giver. So that he might receive as a
consequence both worthy rewards and a deserved punishment, having in his own power
that which he might choose to do, by the tendency of his mind in either direction: whence,
therefore, by envy, mortality comes back upon him; seeing that, although he might escape
it by obedience, he rushes into it by hurrying to be God under the influence of perverse
counsel. Still, nevertheless, God indulgently tempered his punishment by cursing, not so
much himself, as his labours upon earth. And, moreover, what is required does not come
without man’s knowledge; but He shows forth man’s hope of future discovery5019 and salvation
in Christ. And that he is prevented from touching of the wood of the tree of life, is
not caused by the malignant poison of envy, but lest, living for ever without Christ’s previous
pardon of his sins, he should always bear about with him for his punishment an immortality
of guilt. Nevertheless also, in higher regions; that is, above even the firmament itself, regions
which are not now discernible by our eyes, He previously ordained angels, he arranged
spiritual powers, He put in command thrones and powers, and founded many other infinite
spaces of heavens, and unbounded works of His mysteries; so that this world, immense as
it is, might almost appear rather as the latest, than the only work of corporeal things. And
truly,5020 what lies beneath the earth is not itself void of distributed and arranged powers.
For there is a place whither the souls of the just and the unjust are taken, conscious of the
anticipated dooms of future judgment; so that we might behold the overflowing greatness
of God’s works in all directions, not shut up within the bosom of this world, however capacious
as we have said, but might also be able to conceive of them beneath both the abysses
and the depths of the world itself. And thus considering the greatness of the works, we
should worthily admire the Artificer of such a structure.</p>

<head>Chapter II. Argument.—God is Above All Things, Himself Containing All Things,
Immense, Eternal, Transcending the Mind of Man; Inexplicable in Discourse,
Loftier Than All Sublimity.</head>
<p>And over all these things He Himself, containing all things, having nothing vacant
beyond Himself, has left room for no superior God, such as some people conceive. Since,
indeed, He Himself has included all things in the bosom of perfect greatness and power, He
is always intent upon His own work, and pervading all things, and moving all things, and
quickening all things, and beholding all things, and so linking together discordant materials
into the concord of all elements, that out of these unlike principles one world is so established
by a conspiring union, that it can by no force be dissolved, save when He alone who made
it commands it to be dissolved, for the purpose of bestowing other and greater things upon
us. For we read that He contains all things, and therefore that there could have been nothing
beyond Himself. Because, since He has not any beginning, so consequently He is not conscious
of an ending; unless perchance—and far from us be the thought—He at some time
began to be, and is not above all things, but as He began to be after something else, He would
be beneath that which was before Himself, and would so be found to be of less power, in
that He is designated as subsequent even in time itself. For this reason, therefore, He is always
unbounded, because nothing is greater than He; always eternal, because nothing is more
ancient than He. For that which is without beginning can be preceded by none, in that He
has no time. He is on that account immortal, that He does not come to an end by any ending
of His completeness. And since everything that is without beginning is without law, He excludes
the mode of time by feeling Himself debtor to none. Concerning Him, therefore, and
concerning those things which are of Himself, and are in Him, neither can the mind of man
worthily conceive what they are, how great they are, and what they are like; nor does the
eloquence of human discourse set forth a power that approaches the level of His majesty.
For to conceive and to speak of His majesty, as well all eloquence is with reason mute, as all
mind poor. For He is greater than mind itself; nor can it be conceived how great He is, seeing
that, if He could be conceived, He would be smaller than the human mind wherein He could
be conceived. He is greater, moreover, than all discourse, nor can He be declared; for if He
could be declared, He would be less than human discourse, whereby being declared, He can
both be encompassed and contained. For whatever could be thought concerning Him must
be less than Himself; and whatever could be declared must be less than He, when compared
in respect of Himself. Moreover, we can in some degree be conscious of Him in silence, but
we cannot in discourse unfold Him as He is. For should you call Him Light, you would be
speaking of His creature rather than of Himself—you would not declare Him; or should
you call Him Strength, you would rather be speaking of and bringing out His power than
speaking of Himself; or should you call Him Majesty, you would rather be describing His

<pb n="1466"/>
honour than Himself. And why should I make a long business of going through His attributes
one by one? I will at once unfold the whole. Whatever in any respect you might declare of
Him, you would rather be unfolding some condition and power of His than Himself. For
what can you fittingly either say or think concerning Him who is greater than all discourses
and thoughts? Except that in one manner—and how can we do this? how can we by possibility
conceive how we may grasp these very things?—we shall mentally grasp what God is,
if we shall consider that He is that which cannot be understood either in quality or quantity,
nor, indeed, can come even into the thought itself. For if the keenness of our eyes grows
dull on looking at the sun, so that the gaze, overcome by the brightness of the rays that meet
it, cannot look upon the orb itself, the keenness of our mental perception suffers the same
thing in all our thinking about God, and in proportion as we give our endeavours more
directly to consider God, so much the more the mind itself is blinded by the light of its own
thought. For—to repeat once more—what can you worthily say of Him, who is loftier than
all sublimity, and higher than all height, and deeper than all depth, and clearer than all light,
and brighter than all brightness, more brilliant than all splendour, stronger than all strength,
more powerful5021 than all power, and more mighty than all might, and greater than all
majesty, and more potent than all potency, and richer than all riches, more wise than all
wisdom, and more benignant than all kindness, better than all goodness, juster than all
justice, more merciful than all clemency? For all kinds of virtues must needs be less than
Himself, who is both. God and Parent of all virtues, so that it may truly be said that God is
that, which is such that nothing can be compared to Him. For He is above all that can be
said. For He is a certain Mind generating and filling all things, which, without any beginning
or end of time, controls, by the highest and most perfect reason, the naturally linked causes
of things, so as to result in benefit to all.</p>

<p>Him, then, we acknowledge and know to be God, the Creator of all things—Lord on
account of His power, Parent on account of His discipline—Him, I say, who “spake, and all
things were made;”5022 He commanded, and all things went forth: of whom it is written,
“Thou hast made all things in wisdom;”5023 of whom Moses said, “God in heaven above,
and in the earth beneath;”5024 who, according to Isaiah, “hath meted out the heaven with
a span, the earth with the hollow of His hand;”5025 “who looketh on the earth, and maketh
it tremble; who boundeth the circle of the earth, and those that dwell in it like locusts; who
hath weighed the mountains in a balance, and the groves in scales,”5026 that is, by the sure
test of divine arrangement; and lest its greatness, lying unequally, should easily fall into ruins
if it were not balanced with equal weights, He has poised this burden of the earthly mass
with equity. Who says by the prophet, “I am God, and there is none beside me.”5027 Who
says by the same prophet, “Because I will not give my majesty to another,”5028 that He may
exclude all heathens and heretics with their figments; proving that that is not God who is
made by the hand of the workman, nor that which is feigned by the intellect of a heretic.
For he is not God for whose existence the workman must be asked. And He has added hereto
by the prophet, “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what house will ye
build me, and where is the place of my rest?”5029 that He may show that He whom the world
does not contain is much less contained in a temple; and He says these things not for
boastfulness of Himself, but for our knowledge. For He does not desire from us the glory
of His magnitude; but He wishes to confer upon us, even as a father, a religious wisdom.
And He, wishing moreover to attract to gentleness our minds, brutish, and swelling, and
stubborn with cloddish ferocity, says, “And upon whom shall my Spirit rest, save upon him
that is lowly, and quiet, and that trembleth at my words?”5030—so that in some degree one
may recognise how great God is, in learning to fear Him by the Spirit given to him: Who,

that we might deem not that some Nature,—what I know not,—was the artificer of those
vicissitudes whereby nights and days are controlled, but might rather, as is more true, recognise
God as their Creator. And since by the gaze of our eyes we cannot see Him, we rightly
learn of Him from the greatness, and the power, and the majesty of His works. “For the invisible
things of Him,” says the Apostle Paul,” from the creation of the world, are clearly
seen, being understood by those things which are made, even His eternal power and godhead;”
5032 so that the human mind, learning hidden things from those that are manifest,
from the greatness of the works which it should behold, might with the eyes of the mind
consider the greatness of the Architect. Of whom the same apostle, “Now unto the King
eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory.”5033 For He has gone beyond
the contemplation of the eyes who has surpassed the greatness of thought. “For,” it is said,
“of Him, and through Him, and in Him are all things.”5034 For all things are by His command,
because they are of Him; and are ordered by His word as being through Him; and all
things return to His judgment; as in Him expecting liberty when corruption shall be done
away, they appear to be recalled to Him.</p>

<head>Chapter IV. Argument.—Moreover, He is Good, Always the Same, Immutable, One
and Only, Infinite; And His Own Name Can Never Be Declared, and He is Incorruptible
and Immortal.</head>
<p>Him alone the Lord rightly declares good, of whose goodness the whole world is witness;
which world He would not have ordained if He had not been good. For if “everything was
very good,”5035 consequently, and reasonably, both those things which were ordained have
proved that He that ordained them is good, and those things which are the work of a good
Ordainer cannot be other than good; wherefore every evil is a departure from God. For it
cannot happen that He should be the originator or architect of any evil work, who claims
to Himself the name of “the Perfect,” both Parent and Judge, especially when He is the
avenger and judge of every evil work; because, moreover, evil does not occur to man from
any other cause than by his departure from the good God. Moreover, this very thing is specified
in man, not because it was necessary, but because he himself so willed it. Whence it
manifestly appeared also what was evil; and lest there should seem to be envy in God, it was
evident whence evil had arisen. He, then, is always like to Himself; nor does He ever turn
or change Himself into any forms, lest by change He should appear to be mortal. For the
change implied in turning from one thing to another is comprehended as a portion of a
certain death. Thus there is never in Him any accession or increase of any part or honour,
lest anything should appear to have ever been wanting to His perfection, nor is any loss
sustained in Him, lest a degree of mortality should appear to have been suffered by Him.
But what He is, He always is; and who He is, He is always Himself; and what character He
has, He always has.5036 For increasing argues beginning, as well as losses prove death and
perishing. And therefore He says, “I am God, I change not;”5037 in that, what is not born
cannot suffer change, holding His condition always. For whatever it be in Him which constitutes
Divinity, must necessarily exist always, maintaining itself by its own powers, so that
He should always be God. And thus He says, “I am that I am.”5038 For what He is has this
name, because it always maintains the same quality of Himself. For change takes away the
force of that name “That I Am;” for whatever, at any time, is changed, is shown to be mortal
in that very particular which is changed. For it ceases to be that which it had been, and
consequently begins to be what it was not; and therefore, reasonably, there remains always
in God His position, in that without any loss arising from change, He is always like and
equal to Himself. And what is not born cannot be changed: for only those things undergo

change which are made, or which are begotten; in that those things which had not been at
one time, learn to be by coming into being, and therefore to suffer change by being born.
Moreover, those things which neither have nativity nor maker, have excluded from themselves
the capacity of change, not having a beginning wherein is cause of change. And thus
He is declared to be one, having no equal. For whatever can be God, must as God be of necessity
the Highest. But whatever is the Highest, must certainly be the Highest in such sense
as to be without any equal. And thus that must needs be alone and one on which nothing
can be conferred, having no peer; because there cannot be two infinites, as the very nature
of things dictates. And that is infinite which neither has any sort of beginning nor end. For
whatever has occupied the whole excludes the beginning of another. Because if He does not
contain all which is, whatever it is—seeing that what is found in that whereby it is contained
is found to be less than that whereby it is contained—He will cease to be God; being reduced
into the power of another, in whose greatness He, being smaller, shall have been included.
And therefore what contained Him would then rather claim to be God. Whence it results
that God’s own name also cannot be declared, because He cannot be conceived. For that is
contained in a name which is, in any way, comprehended from the condition of His nature.
For the name is the signification of that thing which could be comprehended from a name.
But when that which is treated of is such that it cannot be worthily gathered into one form
by the very understanding itself, how shall it be set forth fittingly in the one word of an appellation,
seeing that as it is beyond the intellect, it must also of necessity be above the significancy
of the appellation? As with reason when He applies and prefers from certain reasons
and occasions His name of God, we know that it is not so much the legitimate propriety of
the appellation that is set forth, as a certain significancy determined for it, to which, while
men betake themselves, they seem to be able thereby to obtain God’s mercy. He is therefore
also both immortal and incorruptible, neither conscious of any kind of loss nor ending.
For because He is incorruptible, He is therefore immortal; and because He is immortal, He
is certainly also incorruptible,—each being involved by turns in the other, with itself and in
itself, by a mutual connection, and prolonged by a vicarious concatenation to the condition
of eternity; immortality arising from incorruption, as well as incorruption coming from
immortality.</p>

<head>Chapter V. Argument.—If We Regard the Anger, and Indignation, and Hatred of
God Described in the Sacred Pages, We Must Remember that They are Not to
Be Understood as Bearing the Character of Human Vices.</head>
<p>Moreover, if we read of His wrath, and consider certain descriptions of His indignation,
and learn that hatred is asserted of Him, yet we are not to understand these to be asserted
of Him in the sense in which they are human vices. For all these things, although they may
corrupt man, cannot at all corrupt the divine power. For such passions as these will rightly
be said to be in men, and will not rightly be judged to be in God. For man may be corrupted
by these things, because he can be corrupted; God may not be corrupted by them, because
He cannot be corrupted. These things, forsooth, have their force which they may exercise,
but only where a material capable of impression precedes them, not where a substance that
cannot be impressed precedes them. For that God is angry, arises from no vice in Him. But
He is so for our advantage; for He is merciful even then when He threatens, because by these
threats men are recalled to rectitude. For fear is necessary for those who want the motive
to a virtuous life, that they who have forsaken reason may at least be moved by terror. And
thus all those, either angers of God or hatreds, or whatever they are of this kind, being displayed
for our medicine,—as the case teaches,—have arisen of wisdom, not from vice, nor
do they originate from frailty; wherefore also they cannot avail for the corruption of God.
For the diversity in us of the materials of which we consist, is accustomed to arouse the
discord of anger which corrupts us; but this, whether of nature or of defect, cannot subsist
in God, seeing that He is known to be constructed assuredly of no associations of bodily
parts. For He is simple and without any corporeal commixture, being wholly of that essence,
which, whatever it be,—He alone knows,—constitutes His being, since He is called Spirit.
And thus those things which in men are faulty and corrupting, since they arise from the
corruptibility of the body, and matter itself, in God cannot exert the force of corruptibility,
since, as we have said, they have come, not of vice, but of reason.</p>

<head>Chapter VI. Argument.—And That, Although Scripture Often Changes the Divine
Appearance into a Human Form, Yet the Measure of the Divine Majesty is Not
Included Within These Lineaments of Our Bodily Nature.</head>
<p>And although the heavenly Scripture often turns the divine appearance into a human
form,—as when it says, “The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous;”5039 or when it says,
“The Lord God smelled the smell of a good savour;”5040 or when there are given to Moses
the tables “written with the finger of God;”5041 or when the people of the children of Israel
are set free from the land of Egypt “with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm;”5042
or when it says, “The mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things;”5043 or when the earth
is set forth as “God’s footstool;”5044 or when it says, “Incline thine ear, and hear,”5045—we
who say that the law is spiritual do not include within these lineaments of our bodily nature
any mode or figure of the divine majesty, but diffuse that character of unbounded magnitude
(so to speak) over its plains without any limit. For it is written, “If I shall ascend into heaven,
Thou art there; if I shall descend into hell, Thou art there also; and if I shall take my wings,
and go away across the sea, there Thy hand shall lay hold of me, and Thy right hand shall
hold me.”5046 For we recognise the plan of the divine Scripture according to the proportion
of its arrangement. For the prophet then was still speaking about God in parables according
to the period of the faith, not as God was, but as the people were able to receive Him. And
thus, that such things as these should be said about God, must be imputed not to God, but
rather to the people. Thus the people are permitted to erect a tabernacle, and yet God is not
contained within the enclosure of a tabernacle. Thus a temple is reared, and yet God is not
at all bounded within the restraints of a temple. It is not therefore God who is limited, but
the perception of the people is limited; nor is God straitened, but the understanding of the
reason of the people is held to be straitened. Finally, in the Gospel the Lord said, “The hour
shall come when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall ye worship the Father;”5047
and gave the reasons, saying, “God is a Spirit; and those therefore who worship, must worship

in spirit and in truth.”5048 Thus the divine agencies are there5049 exhibited by means of
members; it is not the appearance of God nor the bodily lineaments that are described. For
when the eyes are spoken of, it is implied that He sees all things; and when the ear, it is set
forth that He hears all things; and when the finger, a certain energy of His will is opened
up; and when the nostrils, His recognition of prayers is shown forth as of odours; and when
the hand, it is proved that He is the author of every creature; and when the arm, it is announced
that no nature can withstand the power of His arm; and when the feet it is unfolded
that He fills all things, and that there is not any place where God is not. For neither members
nor the offices of members are needful to Him to whose sole judgment, even unexpressed,
all things serve and are present. For why should He require eyes who is Himself the light?
or why should He ask for feet who is everywhere? or why should He wish to go when there
is nowhere where He can go beyond Himself? or why should He seek for hands whose will
is, even when silent, the architect for the foundation of all things? He needs no ears who
knows the wills that are even unexpressed; or for what reason should He need a tongue
whose thought is a command? These members assuredly were necessary to men, but not
to God, because man’s design would be ineffectual if the body did not fulfil the thought.
Moreover, they are not needful to God, whose will the works attend not so much without
any effort, as that the works themselves proceed simultaneously with the will. Moreover,
He Himself is all eye, because He all sees; and all ear, because He all hears; and all hand,
because He all works; and all foot, because He all is everywhere. For He is the same, whatever
it is. He is all equal, and all everywhere. For He has not in Him any diversity in Himself,
being simple. For those are the things which are reduced to diversity of members, which
arise from birth and go to dissolution. But things which are not concrete cannot be conscious
of these things.5050 And what is immortal, whatever it is, that very thing is one and simple,
and for ever. And thus because it is one it cannot be dissolved; since whatever is that very
thing which is placed beyond the claim of dissolution, it is freed from the laws of death.</p>

<head>Chapter VII. Argument.—Moreover, that When God is Called a Spirit, Brightness,
and Light, God is Not Sufficiently Expressed by Those Appellations.</head>
<p>But when the Lord says that God is a Spirit, I think that Christ spoke thus of the Father,
as wishing that something still more should be understood than merely that God is a Spirit.
For although, in His Gospel, He is reasoning for the purpose of giving to men an increase
of intelligence, nevertheless He Himself speaks to men concerning God, in such a way as
they can as yet hear and receive; although, as we have said, He is now endeavouring to give
to His hearers religious additions to their knowledge of God. For we find it to be written
that God is called Love, and yet from this the substance of God is not declared to be Love;
and that He is called Light, while in this is not the substance of God. But the whole that is
thus said of God is as much as can be said, so that reasonably also, when He is called a
Spirit, it is not all that He is which is so called; but so that, while men’s mind by understanding
makes progress even to the Spirit itself, being already changed in spirit, it may conjecture
God to be something even greater through the Spirit. For that which is, according to what
it is, can neither be declared by human discourse, nor received by human ears, nor gathered
by human perceptions. For if “the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him,
neither eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, nor the heart of man, nor even his mind has perceived;”
5051 what and how great is He Himself who promises these things, in understanding
which both the mind and nature of man have failed! Finally, if you receive the Spirit as the
substance of God, you will make God a creature. For every spirit is a creature. And therefore,
then, God will be made. In which manner also, if, according to Moses, you should receive
God to be fire, in saying that He is a creature, you will have declared what is ordained, you
will not have taught who is its ordainer. But these things are rather used as figures than as
being so in fact. For as, in the Old Testament,5052 God is for this reason called Fire, that fear
may be struck into the hearts of a sinful people, by suggesting to them a Judge; so in the
New Testament He is announced as Spirit, that, as the Renewer and Creator of those who
are dead in their sins, He may be attested by this goodness of mercy granted to those that
believe.</p>

worships, to whom the universal and entire nature of things as well visible as invisible gives
witness; whom angels adore, stars wonder at, seas bless, lands revere, and all things under
the earth look up to; whom the whole mind of man is conscious of, even if it does not express
itself; at whose command all things are set in motion, springs gush forth, rivers flow, waves
arise, all creatures bring forth their young, winds are compelled to blow, showers descend,
seas are stirred up, all things everywhere diffuse their fruitfulness. Who ordained, peculiar
to the protoplasts of eternal life, a certain beautiful paradise in the east; He planted the tree
of life, and similarly placed near it another tree of the knowledge of good and evil, gave a
command, and decreed a judgment against sin; He preserved the most righteous Nöe from
the perils of the deluge, for the merit of His innocence and faith; He translated Enoch: He
elected Abraham into the society of his friendship; He protected Isaac: He increased Jacob;
He gave Moses for a leader unto the people; He delivered the groaning children of Israel
from the yoke of slavery; He wrote the law; He brought the offspring of our fathers into the
land of promise; He instructed the prophets by His Spirit, and by all of them He promised
His Son Christ; and at the time at which He had covenanted that He would give Him, He
sent Him, and through Him He desired to come into our knowledge, and shed forth upon
us the liberal stores of His mercy, by conferring His abundant Spirit on the poor and abject.
And, because He of His own free-will is both liberal and kind, lest the whole of this globe,
being turned away from the streams of His grace, should wither, He willed the apostles, as
founders of our family, to be sent by His Son into the whole world, that the condition of the
human race might be conscious of its Founder; and, if it should choose to follow Him, might
have One whom even in its supplications it might now call Father instead of God.5053 And
His providence has had or has its course among men, not only individually, but also among
cities themselves, and states whose destructions have been announced by the words of
prophets; yea, even through the whole world itself; whose end, whose miseries, and wastings,
and sufferings on account of unbelief He has allotted. And lest moreover any one should
think that such an indefatigable providence of God does not reach to even the very least
things, “One of two sparrows,” says the Lord, “shall not fall without the will of the Father;
but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.”5054 And His care and providence

did not permit even the clothes of the Israelites to be worn out, nor even the vilest shoes on
their feet to be wasted; nor, moreover, finally, the very garments of the captive young men
to be burnt. And this is not without reason; for if He embraces all things, and contains all
things,—and all things, and the whole, consist of individuals,—His care will consequently
extend even to every individual thing, since His providence reaches to the whole, whatever
it is. Hence it is that He also sitteth above the Cherubim; that is, He presides over the variety
of His works, the living creatures which hold the control over the rest being subjected to
His throne:5055 a crystal covering being thrown over all things; that is, the heaven covering
all things, which at the command of God had been consolidated into a firmament5056 from
the fluent material of the waters, that the strong hardness that divides the midst of the waters
that covered the earth before, might sustain as if on its back the weight of the superincumbent
water, its strength being established by the frost. And, moreover, wheels lie below—that is
to say, the seasons—whereby all the members of the world are always being rolled onwards;
such feet being added by which those things do not stand still for ever, but pass onward.
And, moreover, throughout all their limbs they are studded with eyes; for the works of God
must be contemplated with an ever watchful inspection: in the heart of which things, a fire
of embers is in the midst, either because this world of ours is hastening to the fiery day of
judgment; or because all the works of God are fiery, and are not darksome, but flourish.5057
Or, moreover, lest, because those things had arisen from earthly beginnings, they should
naturally be inactive, from the rigidity of their origin, the hot nature of an interior spirit
was added to all things; and that this nature concreted with the cold bodies might minister5058
for the purpose of life equal measures for all.5059 This, therefore, according to David, is
God’s chariot. “For the chariot of God,” says he, “is multiplied ten thousand times;”5060 that
is, it is innumerable, infinite, immense. For, under the yoke of the natural law given to all
things, some things are restrained, as if withheld by reins; others, as if stimulated, are urged
on with relaxed reins. For the world,5061 which is that chariot of God with all things, both

<head>Chapter IX. Argument.—Further, that the Same Rule of Truth Teaches Us to Believe,
After the Father, Also in the Son of God, Jesus Christ Our Lord God, Being the
Same that Was Promised in the Old Testament, and Manifested in the New.</head>
<p>The same rule of truth teaches us to believe, after the Father, also on the Son of God,
Christ Jesus, the Lord our God, but the Son of God—of that God who is both one and alone,
to wit the Founder of all things, as already has been expressed above. For this Jesus Christ,
I will once more say, the Son of this God, we read of as having been promised in the Old
Testament, and we observe to be manifested in the New, fulfilling the shadows and figures
of all the sacraments, with the presence of the truth embodied. For as well the ancient
prophecies as the Gospels testify Him to be the son of Abraham and the son of David.
Genesis itself anticipates Him, when it says: “To thee will I give it, and to thy seed.”5063 He
is spoken of when it shows how a man wrestled with Jacob; He too, when it says: “There
shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a leader from between his thighs, until He shall come
to whom it has been promised; and He shall be the expectation of the nations.”5064 He is
spoken of by Moses when he says: “Provide another whom thou mayest send.”5065 He is
again spoken of by the same, when he testifies, saying: “A Prophet will God raise up to you
from your brethren; listen to Him as if to me.”5066 It is He, too, that he speaks of when he
says: “Ye shall see your life hanging in doubt night and day, and ye shall not believe Him.”5067
Him, too, Isaiah alludes to: “There shall go forth a rod from the root of Jesse, and a flower
shall grow up from his root.”5068 The same also when he says: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive,
and bear a son.”5069 Him he refers to when he enumerates the healings that were to proceed
from Him, saying: “Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall
hear: then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be eloquent.”
5070 Him also, when he sets forth the virtue of patience, saying: “His voice shall not
be heard in the streets; a bruised reed shall He not destroy, and the smoking flax shall He
not quench.”5071 Him, too, when he described His Gospel: “And I will ordain for you an
everlasting covenant, even the sure mercies of David.”5072 Him, too, when he foretells that

the nations should believe on Him: “Behold, I have given Him for a Chief and a Commander
to the nations. Nations that knew not Thee shall call upon Thee, and peoples that knew
Thee not shall flee unto Thee.”5073 It is the same that he refers to when, concerning His
passion, he exclaims, saying: “As a sheep He is led to the slaughter; and as a lamb before his
shearer is dumb, so He opened not His mouth in His humility.”5074 Him, moreover, when
he described the blows and stripes of His scourgings: “By His bruises we were healed.”5075
Or His humiliation: “And we saw Him, and He had neither form nor comeliness, a man in
suffering, and who knoweth how to bear infirmity.”5076 Or that the people would not believe
on Him: “All day long I have spread out my hands unto a people that believeth not.”5077
Or that He would rise again from the dead: “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse,
and one who shall rise to reign over the nations; on Him shall the nations hope, and His
rest shall be honour.”5078 Or when he speaks of the time of the resurrection: “We shall find
Him, as it were, prepared in the morning.”5079 Or that He should sit at the right hand of
the Father: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I shall place Thine
enemies as the stool of Thy feet.”5080 Or when He is set forth as possessor of all things: “Ask
of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the boundaries of the
earth for Thy possession.”5081 Or when He is shown as Judge of all: “O God, give the King
Thy judgment, and Thy righteousness to the King’s Son.”5082 And I shall not in this place
pursue the subject further: the things which are announced of Christ are known to all heretics,
but are even better known to those who hold the truth.</p>

<head>Chapter X. Argument.—That Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Truly Man, as
Opposed to the Fancies of Heretics, Who Deny that He Took Upon Him True
Flesh.</head>
<p>But of this I remind you, that Christ was not to be expected in the Gospel in any other
wise than as He was promised before by the Creator, in the Scriptures of the Old Testament;
especially as the things that were predicted of Him were fulfilled, and those things that were
fulfilled had been predicted. As with reason I might truly and constantly say to that fanciful—I
know not what—of those heretics who reject the authority of the Old Testament, as to a
Christ feigned and coloured up from old wives’ fables: “Who art thou? Whence art thou?
By whom art thou sent? Wherefore hast thou now chosen to come? Why such as thou art?
Or how hast thou been able to come? Or wherefore hast thou not gone to thine own, except
that thou hast proved that thou hast none of thine own, by coming to those of another?
What hast thou to do with the Creator’s world? What hast thou to do with the Creator’s
man? What hast thou to do with the image of a body from which thou takest away the hope
of resurrection? Why comest thou to another man’s servant, and desirest thou to solicit
another man’s son? Why dost thou strive to take me away from the Lord? Why dost thou
compel me to blaspheme, and to be impious to my Father? Or what shall I gain from thee
in the resurrection, if I do not receive myself when I lose my body? If thou wishest to save,
thou shouldest have made a man to whom to give salvation. If thou desirest to snatch from
sin, thou shouldest have granted to me previously that I should not fall into sin. But what
approbation of law dost thou carry about with thee? What testimony of the prophetic word
hast thou? Or what substantial good can I promise myself from thee, when I see that thou
hast come in a phantasm and not in a bodily substance? What, then, hast thou to do with
the form of a body, if thou hatest a body? Nay, thou wilt be refuted as to the hatred of
bearing about the substance of a body, since thou hast been willing even to take up its form.
For thou oughtest to have hated the imitation of a body, if thou hatedst the reality; because,
if thou art something else, thou oughtest to have come as something else, lest thou shouldest
be called the Son of the Creator if thou hadst even the likeness of flesh and body. Assuredly,
if thou hatedst being born because thou hatedst ‘the Creator’s marriage-union,’ thou
oughtest to refuse even the likeness of a man who is born by the ‘marriage of the Creator.’”</p>
<p>Neither, therefore, do we acknowledge that that is a Christ of the heretics who was—as
it is said—in appearance and not in reality; for of those things which he did, he could have
done nothing real, if he himself was a phantasm, and not reality. Nor him who wore nothing
of our body in himself, seeing “he received nothing from Mary;” neither did he come to us,
since he appeared “as a vision, not in our substance.” Nor do we acknowledge that to be
Christ who chose an ethereal or starry flesh, as some heretics have pretended. Nor can we
perceive any salvation of ours in him, if in him we do not even recognise the substance of

<pb n="1481"/>
our body; nor, in short, any other who may have worn any other kind of fabulous body of
heretical device. For all such fables as these are confuted as well by the nativity as by the
death itself of our Lord. For John says: “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;”5083
so that, reasonably, our body should be in Him, because indeed the Word took on Him our
flesh. And for this reason blood flowed forth from His hands and feet, and from His very
side, so that He might be proved to be a sharer in our body by dying according to the laws
of our dissolution. And that He was raised again in the same bodily substance in which He
died, is proved by the wounds of that very body, and thus He showed the laws of our resurrection
in His flesh, in that He restored the same body in His resurrection which He had
from us. For a law of resurrection is established, in that Christ is raised up in the substance
of the body as an example for the rest; because, when it is written that “flesh and blood do
not inherit the kingdom of God,”5084 it is not the substance of the flesh that is condemned,
which was built up by the divine hands that it should not perish, but only the guilt of the
flesh is rightly rebuked, which by the voluntary daring of man rebelled against the claims
of divine law. Because in baptism and in the dissolution of death the flesh is raised up and
returns to salvation, by being recalled to the condition of innocency when the mortality of
guilt is put away.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—And Indeed that Christ Was Not Only Man, But God Also; That Even
as He Was the Son of Man, So Also He Was the Son of God.</head>
<p>But lest, from the fact of asserting that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Creator,
was manifested in the substance of the true body, we should seem either to have given assent
to other heretics, who in this place maintain that He is man only and alone, and therefore
desire to prove that He was a man bare and solitary; and lest we should seem to have afforded
them any ground for objecting, we do not so express doctrine concerning the substance of
His body, as to say that He is only and alone man, but so as to maintain, by the association
of the divinity of the Word in that very materiality, that He was also God according to the
Scriptures. For there is a great risk of saying that the Saviour of the human race was only
man; that the Lord of all, and the Chief of the world, to whom all things were delivered, and
all things were granted by His Father, by whom all things were ordained, all things were
created, all things were arranged, the King of all ages and times, the Prince of all the angels,
before whom there is none but the Father, was only man, and denying to Him divine authority
in these things. For this contempt of the heretics will recoil also upon God the Father, if
God the Father could not beget God the Son. But, moreover, no blindness of the heretics
shall prescribe to the truth. Nor, because they maintain one thing in Christ and, do not
maintain another, they see one side of Christ and do not see another, shall there be taken
away from us that which they do not see for the sake of that which they do. For they regard
the weaknesses in Him as if they were a man’s weaknesses, but they do not count the powers
as if they were a God’s powers. They keep in mind the infirmities of the flesh, they exclude
the powers of the divinity; when if this argument from the infirmities of Christ is of avail
to the result of proving Him to be man from His infirmities, the argument of divinity in
Him gathered from His powers avails to the result also of asserting Him to be God from
His works. For if His sufferings show in Him human frailty, why may not His works assert
in Him divine power? For if this should not avail to assert Him to be God from His powers,
neither can His sufferings avail to show Him to be man also from them. For whatever
principle be adopted on one or the other side, will be found to be maintained.5085 For there
will be a risk that He should not be shown to be man from His sufferings, if He could not
also be approved as God by His powers. We must not then lean to one side and evade the
other side, because any one who should exclude one portion of the truth will never hold the
perfect truth. For Scripture as much announces Christ as also God, as it announces God
Himself as man. It has as much described Jesus Christ to be man, as moreover it has also
described Christ the Lord to be God. Because it does not set forth Him to be the Son of God
only, but also the Son of man; nor does it only say, the Son of man, but it has also been accustomed
to speak of Him as the Son of God. So that being of both, He is both, lest if He
<note type="footnote">5085 Scil. in its alternative.</note>

<pb n="1483"/>
should be one only, He could not be the other. For as nature itself has prescribed that he
must be believed to be a man who is of man, so the same nature prescribes also that He must
be believed to be God who is of God; but if he should not also be God when he is of God,
no more should he be man although he should be of man. And thus both doctrines would
be endangered in one and the other way, by one being convicted to have lost belief in the
other. Let them, therefore, who read that Jesus Christ the Son of man is man, read also that
this same Jesus is called also God and the Son of God. For in the manner that as man He is
of Abraham, so also as God He is before Abraham himself. And in the same manner as He
is as man the “Son of David,”5086 so as God He is proclaimed David’s Lord. And in the same
manner as He was made as man “under the law,”5087 so as God He is declared to be “Lord
of the Sabbath.”5088 And in the same manner as He suffers, as man, the condemnation, so
as God He is found to have all judgment of the quick and dead. And in the same manner
as He is born as man subsequent to the world, so as God He is manifested to have been before
the world. And in the same way as He was begotten as man of the seed of David, so also the
world is said to have been ordained by Him as God. And in the same way as He was as man
after many, so as God He was before all. And in the same manner as He was as man inferior
to others, so as God He was greater than all. And in the same manner as He ascended as
man into heaven, so as God He had first descended thence. And in the same manner as He
goes as man to the Father, so as the Son in obedience to the Father He shall descend thence.
So if imperfections in Him prove human frailty, majesties in Him affirm divine power. For
the risk is, in reading of both, to believe not both, but one of the two. Wherefore as both are
read of in Christ, let both be believed; that so finally the faith may be true, being also complete.
For if of two principles one gives way in the faith, and the other, and that indeed which is
of least importance, be taken up for belief, the rule of truth is thrown into confusion; and
that boldness will not confer salvation, but instead of salvation will effect a great risk of
death from the overthrow of the faith.</p>

<head>Chapter XII. Argument.—That Christ is God, is Proved by the Authority of the Old
Testament Scriptures.</head>
<p>Why, then, should we hesitate to say what Scripture does not shrink from declaring?
Why shall the truth of faith hesitate in that wherein the authority of Scripture has never
hesitated? For, behold, Hosea the prophet says in the person of the Father: “I will not now
save them by bow, nor by horses, nor by horsemen; but I will save them by the Lord their
God.”5089 If God says that He saves by God, still God does not save except by Christ. Why,
then, should man hesitate to call Christ God, when he observes that He is declared to be
God by the Father according to the Scriptures? Yea, if God the Father does not save except
by God, no one can be saved by God the Father unless he shall have confessed Christ to be
God, in whom and by whom the Father promises that He will give him salvation: so that,
reasonably, whoever acknowledges Him to be God, may find salvation in Christ God;
whoever does not acknowledge Him to be God, would lose salvation which he could not
find elsewhere than in Christ God. For in the same way as Isaiah says, “Behold, a virgin shall
conceive and bear a son, and ye shall call His name Emmanuel, which is, interpreted, God
with us;”5090 so Christ Himself says, “Lo, I am with you, even to the consummation of the
world.”5091 Therefore He is “God with us;” yea, and much rather, He is in us. Christ is with
us, therefore it is He whose name is God with us, because He also is with us; or is He not
with us? How then does He say that He is with us? He, then, is with us. But because He is
with us He was called Emmanuel, that is, God with us. God, therefore, because He is with
us, was called God with us. The same prophet says: “Be ye strengthened, ye relaxed hands,
and ye feeble knees; be consoled, ye that are cowardly in heart; be strong; fear not. Lo, our
God shall return judgment; He Himself shall come, and shall save you: then shall the eyes
of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as
an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be eloquent.”5092 Since the prophet says that at
God’s advent these should be the signs which come to pass; let men acknowledge either that
Christ is the Son of God, at whose advent and by whom these wonders of healings were
performed; or, overcome by the truth of Christ’s divinity, let them rush into the other heresy,
and refusing to confess Christ to be the Son of God, and God, let them declare Him to be
the Father. For, being bound by the words of the prophets, they can no longer deny Christ
to be God. What, then, do they reply when those signs are said to be about to take place on
the advent of God, which were manifested on the advent of Christ? In what way do they
receive Christ as God? For now they cannot deny Him to be God. As God the Father, or as

<pb n="1485"/>
God the Son? If as the Son, why do they deny that the Son of God is God? If as the Father,
why do they not follow those who appear to maintain blasphemies of that kind? unless because
in this contest against them concerning the truth, this is in the meantime sufficient
for us, that, being convinced in any kind of way, they should confess Christ to be God, seeing
they have even wished to deny that He is God. He says by Habakkuk the prophet: “God shall
come from the south, and the Holy One from the dark and dense mountain.”5093 Whom
do they wish to represent as coming from the south? If they say that it is the Almighty God
the Father, then God the Father comes from a place, from which place, moreover, He is thus
excluded, and He is bounded within the straitnesses of some abode; and thus by such as
these, as we have said, the sacrilegious heresy of Sabellius is embodied. Since Christ is believed
to be not the Son, but the Father; since by them He is asserted to be in strictness a bare man,
in a new manner, by those, again, Christ is proved to be God the Father Almighty. But if in
Bethlehem, the region of which local division looks towards the southern portion of heaven,
Christ is born, who by the Scriptures is also said to be God, this God is rightly described as
coming from the south, because He was foreseen as about to come from Bethlehem. Let
them, then, choose of the two alternatives, the one that they prefer, that He who came from
the south is the Son, or the Father; for God is said to be about to come from the south. If
the Son, why do they shrink from calling Him Christ and God? For the Scripture says that
God shall come. If the Father, why do they shrink from being associated with the boldness
of Sabellius, who says that Christ is the Father? unless because, whether they call Him
Father or Son, from his heresy, however unwillingly, they must needs withdraw if they are
accustomed to say that Christ is merely man; when compelled by the facts themselves, they
are on the eve of exalting Him as God, whether in wishing to call Him Father or in wishing
to call Him Son.</p>

Him were made all the works, and without Him was nothing made.”5098 “Whether,” says
the apostle, “they be thrones or dominations, or powers, or mights, visible things and invisible,
all things subsist by Him.”5099 Moreover, this is that word which came unto His own,
and His own received Him not. For the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him
not.”5100 Moreover, this Word “was in the beginning with God, and God was the Word.”5101
Who then can doubt, when in the last clause it is said, “The Word was made flesh, and dwelt
among us,” that Christ, whose is the nativity, and because He was made flesh, is man; and
because He is the Word of God, who can shrink from declaring without hesitation that He
is God, especially when he considers the evangelical Scripture, that it has associated both
of these substantial natures into one concord of the nativity of Christ? For He it is who “as
a bridegroom goeth forth from his bride-chamber; He exulted as a giant to run his way. His
going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return unto the ends of it.”5102 Because,
even to the highest, “not any one hath ascended into heaven save He who came down from
heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.”5103 Repeating this same thing, He says: “Father,
glorify me with that glory wherewith I was with Thee before the world was.”5104 And if this
Word came down from heaven as a bridegroom to the flesh, that by the assumption of flesh
He might ascend thither as the Son of man, whence the Son of God had descended as the
Word, reasonably, while by the mutual connection both flesh wears the Word of God, and

the Son of God assumes the frailty of the flesh; when the flesh being espoused ascending
thither, whence without the flesh it had descended, it at length receives that glory which in
being shown to have had before the foundation of the world, it is most manifestly proved
to be God. And, nevertheless, while the world itself is said to have been founded after Him,
it is found to have been created by Him; by that very divinity in Him whereby the world
was made, both His glory and His authority are proved. Moreover, if, whereas it is the
property of none but God to know the secrets of the heart, Christ beholds the secrets of the
heart; and if, whereas it belongs to none but God to remit sins, the same Christ remits sins;
and if, whereas it is the portion of no man to come from heaven, He descended by coming
from heaven; and if, whereas this word can be true of no man, “I and the Father are one,”5105
Christ alone declared this word out of the consciousness of His divinity; and if, finally, the
Apostle Thomas, instructed in all the proofs and conditions of Christ’s divinity, says in reply
to Christ, “My Lord and my God;”5106 and if, besides, the Apostle Paul says, “Whose are
the fathers, and of whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed
for evermore,”5107 writing in his epistles; and if the same apostle declares that he was ordained
“an apostle not by men, nor of man, but by Jesus Christ;”5108 and if the same contends that
he learned the Gospel not from men or by man, but received it from Jesus Christ, reasonably
Christ is God. Therefore, in this respect, one of two things must needs be established. For
since it is evident that all things were made by Christ, He is either before all things, since all
things were by Him, and so He is justly God; or because He is man He is subsequent to all
things, and justly nothing was made by Him. But we cannot say that nothing was made by
Him, when we observe it written that all things were made by Him. He is not therefore
subsequent to all things; that is, He is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but
God also, since God is prior to all things. For He is before all things, because all things are
by Him, while if He were only man, nothing would be by Him; or if all things were by Him,
He would not be man only, because if He were only man, all things would not be by Him;
nay, nothing would be by Him. What, then, do they reply? That nothing is by Him, so that
He is man only? How then are all things by Him? Therefore He is not man only, but God
also, since all things are by Him; so that we reasonably ought to understand that Christ is
not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since by Him all things were
made. For how can you say that He is man only, when you see Him also in the flesh, unless
because when both aspects are considered, both truths are rightly believed?</p>

<head>Chapter XIV. Argument.—The Author Prosecutes the Same Argument.</head>
<p>And yet the heretic still shrinks from urging that Christ is God, whom he perceives to
be proved God by so many words as well as facts. If Christ is only man, how, when He came
into this world, did He come unto His own, since a man could have made no world? If Christ
was only man, how is the world said to have been made by Him, when the world was not
by man, but man was ordained after the world? If Christ was only man, how was it that
Christ was not only of the seed of David; but He was the Word made flesh and dwelt among
us? For although the Protoplast was not born of seed, yet neither was the Protoplast formed
of the conjunction of the Word and the flesh. For He is not the Word made flesh, nor dwelt
in us. If Christ was only man, how does He “who cometh from heaven testify what He hath
seen and heard,”5109 when it is plain that man cannot come from heaven, because he cannot
be born there? If Christ be only man, how are “visible things and invisible, thrones, powers,
and dominions,” said to be created by Him and in Him; when the heavenly powers could
not have been made by man, since they must needs have been prior to man? If Christ is only
man, how is He present wherever He is called upon; when it is not the nature of man, but
of God, that it can be present in every place? If Christ is only man, why is a man invoked in
prayers as a Mediator, when the invocation of a man to afford salvation is condemned as
ineffectual? If Christ is only man, why is hope rested upon Him, when hope in man is declared
to be accursed? If Christ is only man, why may not Christ be denied without destruction of
the soul, when it is said that a sin committed against man may be forgiven? If Christ is only
man, how comes John the Baptist to testify and say, “He who cometh after me has become
before me, because He was prior to me;”5110 when, if Christ were only man, being born
after John, He could not be before John, unless because He preceded him, in that He is God?
If Christ is only man, how is it that “what things the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son
likewise,”5111 when man cannot do works like to the heavenly operations of God? If Christ
is only man, how is it that “even as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the
Son to have life in Himself,”5112 when man cannot have life in him after the example of God
the Father, because he is not glorious in eternity, but made with the materials of mortality?
If Christ is only man, how does He say, “I am the bread of eternal life which came down
from heaven,”5113 when man can neither be the bread of life, he himself being mortal, nor
could he have come down from heaven, since no perishable material is established in heaven?
If Christ is only man, how does He say that “no man hath seen God at any time, save He

which is of God; He hath seen God?”5114 Because if Christ is only man, He could not see
God, because no man has seen God; but if, being of God, He has seen God, He wishes it to
be understood that He is more than man, in that He has seen God. If Christ is only man,
why does He say, “What if ye shall see the Son of man ascending thither where He was before?”
5115 But He ascended into heaven, therefore He was there, in that He returned thither
where He was before. But if He was sent from heaven by the Father, He certainly is not man
only; for man, as we have said, could not come from heaven. Therefore as man He was not
there before, but ascended thither where He was not. But the Word of God descended which
was there,—the Word of God, I say, and God by whom all things were made, and without
whom nothing was made. It was not therefore man that thus came thence from heaven, but
the Word of God; that is, God descended thence.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.5116 Argument.—Again He Proves from the Gospel that Christ is God.</head>
<p>If Chr-ist is only man, how is it that He says, “Though I bear record of myself, yet my
record is true: because I know whence I came, and whither I go; ye know not whence I
came, and whither I go. Ye judge after the flesh?”5117 Behold, also He says, that He shall
return thither whence He bears witness that He came before, as being sent,—to wit, from
heaven. He came down therefore from whence He came, in the same manner as He goes
thither from whence He descended. Whence if Christ were only man, He would not have
come thence, and therefore would not depart thither, because He would not have come
thence. Moreover, by coming thence, whence as man He could not have come, He shows
Himself to have come as God. For the Jews, ignorant and untaught in the matter of this very
descent of His, made these heretics their successors, seeing that to them it is said, “Ye know
not whence I come, and whither I go: ye judge after the flesh.” As much they as the Jews,
holding that the carnal birth of Christ was the only one, believed that Christ was nothing
else than man; not considering this point, that as man could not come from heaven, so as
that he might return thither, He who descended thence must be God, seeing that man could
not come thence. If Christ is only man, how does He say, “Ye are from below, I am from
above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world?”5118 But therefore if every man is of this
world, and Christ is for that reason in this world, is He only man? God forbid! But consider
what He says: “I am not of this world.” Does He then speak falsely when He says “of this
world,” if He is only man? Or if He does not speak falsely, He is not of this world; He is
therefore not man only, because He is not of this world. But that it should not be a secret
who He was, He declared whence He was: “I,” said He, “am from above,” that is, from
heaven, whence man cannot come, for he was not made in heaven. He is God, therefore,
who is from above, and therefore He is not of this world; although, moreover, in a certain
manner He is of this world: wherefore Christ is not God only, but man also. As reasonably
in the way in which He is not of this world according to the divinity of the Word, so He is
of this world according to the frailty of the body that He has taken upon Him. For man is
joined with God, and God is linked with man. But on that account this Christ here laid more
stress on the one aspect of His sole divinity, because the Jewish blindness contemplated in
Christ the aspect alone of the flesh; and thence in the present passage He passed over in silence
the frailty of the body, which is of the world, and spoke of His divinity alone, which
is not of the world: so that in proportion as they had inclined to believe Him to be only man,
in that proportion Christ might draw them to consider His divinity, so as to believe Him to
be God, desirous to overcome their incredulity concerning His divinity by omitting in the

<pb n="1491"/>
meantime any mention of His human condition, and by setting before them His divinity
alone. If Christ is man only, how does He say, “I proceeded forth and came from God,”5119
when it is evident that man was made by God, and did not proceed forth from Him? But in
the way in which as man He proceeded not from God, thus the Word of God proceeded, of
whom it is said, “My heart hath uttered forth a good Word;”5120 which, because it is from
God, is with reason also with God. And this, too, since it was not uttered without effect,
reasonably makes all things: “For all things were made by Him, and without Him was
nothing made.”5121 But this Word whereby all things were made (is God). “And God,” says
he, “was the Word.”5122 Therefore God proceeded from God, in that the Word which proceeded
is God, who proceeded forth from God. If Christ is only man, how does He say, “If
any man shall keep my word, he shall not see death for ever?”5123 Not to see death for ever!
what is this but immortality? But immortality is the associate of divinity, because both the
divinity is immortal, and immortality is the fruit of divinity. For every man is mortal; and
immortality cannot be from that which is mortal. Therefore from Christ, as a mortal man,
immortality cannot arise. “But,” says He, “whosoever keepeth my word, shall not see death
for ever;” therefore the word of Christ affords immortality, and by immortality affords divinity.
But although it is not possible to maintain that one who is himself mortal can make
another immortal, yet this word of Christ not only sets forth, but affords immortality: certainly
He is not man only who gives immortality, which if He were only man He could not
give; but by giving divinity by immortality, He proves Himself to be God by offering divinity,
which if He were not God He could not give. If Christ was only man, how did He say, “Before
Abraham was, I Am?”5124 For no man can be before Him from whom he himself is; nor
can it be that any one should have been prior to him of whom he himself has taken his origin.
And yet Christ, although He is born of Abraham, says that He is before Abraham. Either,
therefore, He says what is not true, and deceives, if He was not before Abraham, seeing that
He was of Abraham; or He does not deceive, if He is also God, and was before Abraham.
And if this were not so, it follows that, being of Abraham, He could not be before Abraham.
If Christ was only man, how does He say, “And I know them, and my sheep follow me; and
I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish?”5125 And yet, since every man is
bound by the laws of mortality, and therefore is unable to keep himself for ever, much more

will he be unable to keep another for ever. But Christ promises to give salvation for ever,
which if He does not give, He is a deceiver; if He gives, He is God. But He does not deceive,
for He gives what He promises. Therefore He is God who proffers eternal salvation, which
man, being unable to keep himself for ever, cannot be able to give to another. If Christ is
only man, what is that which He says, “I and the Father are one?”5126 For how can it be that
“I and the Father are one,” if He is not both God and the Son?—who may therefore be called
one, seeing that He is of Himself, being both His Son, and being born of Him, being declared
to have proceeded from Him, by which He is also God; which when the Jews thought to be
hateful, and believed to be blasphemous, for that He had shown Himself in these discourses
to be God, and therefore rushed at once to stoning, and set to work passionately to hurl
stones, He strongly refuted His adversaries by the example and witness of the Scriptures.
“If,” said He, “He called them gods to whom the words of God were given, and the Scriptures
cannot be broken, ye say of Him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into this world, Thou
blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.”5127 By which words He did not deny
Himself to be God, but rather He confirmed the assertion that He was God. For because,
undoubtedly, they are said to be gods unto whom the words of God were given, much more
is He God who is found to be superior to all these. And nevertheless He refuted the calumny
of blasphemy in a fitting manner with lawful tact.5128 For He wishes that He should be thus
understood to be God, as the Son of God, and He would not wish to be understood to be
the Father Himself. Thus He said that He was sent, and showed them that He had manifested
many good works from the Father; whence He desired that He should not be understood
to be the Father, but the Son. And in the latter portion of His defence He made mention of
the Son, not the Father, when He said, “Ye say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the
Son of God.” Thus, as far as pertains to the guilt of blasphemy, He calls Himself the Son,
not the Father; but as pertaining to His divinity, by saying, “I and the Father are one,” He
proved that He was the Son of God. He is God, therefore, but God in such a manner as to
be the Son, not the Father.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.5129 Argument.—Again from the Gospel He Proves Christ to Be God.</head>
<p>If Christ was only man, how is it that He Himself says, “And every one that believeth
in me shall not die for evermore?”5130 And yet he who believes in man by himself alone is
called accursed; but he who believes on Christ is not accursed, but is said not to die for
evermore. Whence, if on the one hand He is man only, as the heretics will have it, how shall
not anybody who believes in Him die eternally, since he who trusts in man is held to be accursed?
Or on the other, if he is not accursed, but rather, as it is read, destined for the attainment
of everlasting life, Christ is not man only, but God also, in whom he who believes both
lays aside all risk of curse, and attains to the fruit of righteousness. If Christ was only man,
how does He say that the Paraclete “shall take of His, those things which He shall declare?”
5131 For neither does the Paraclete receive anything from man, but the Paraclete offers
knowledge to man; nor does the Paraclete learn things future from man, but instructs man
concerning futurity. Therefore either the Paraclete has not received from Christ, as man,
what He should declare, since man could give nothing to the Paraclete, seeing that from
Him man himself ought to receive, and Christ in the present instance is both mistaken and
deceives, in saying that the Paraclete shall receive from Him, being a man, the things which
He may declare; or He does not deceive us,—as in fact He does not,—and the Paraclete has
received from Christ what He may declare. But if He has received from Christ what He may
declare to us, Christ is greater than the Paraclete, because the Paraclete would not receive
from Christ unless He were less than Christ. But the Paraclete being less than Christ,
moreover, by this very fact proves Christ to be God, from whom He has received what He
declares: so that the testimony of Christ’s divinity is immense, in the Paraclete being found
to be in this economy less than Christ, and taking from Him what He gives to others; seeing
that if Christ were only man, Christ would receive from the Paraclete what He should say,
not the Paraclete receive from Christ what He should declare. If Christ was only man,
wherefore did He lay down for us such a rule of believing as that in which He said, “And
this is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the only and true God, and Jesus Christ,
whom Thou hast sent?”5132 Had He not wished that He also should be understood to be
God, why did He add, “And Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent,” except because He wished
to be received as God also? Because if He had not wished to be understood to be God, He
would have added, “And the man Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent;” but, in fact, He
neither added this, nor did Christ deliver Himself to us as man only, but associated Himself
with God, as He wished to be understood by this conjunction to be God also, as He is. We

must therefore believe, according to the rule prescribed,5133 on the Lord, the one true God,
and consequently on Him whom He has sent, Jesus Christ, who by no means, as we have
said, would have linked Himself to the Father had He not wished to be understood to be
God also: for He would have separated Himself from Him had He not wished to be understood
to be God. He would have placed Himself among men only, had He known Himself
to be only man; nor would He have linked Himself with God had He not known Himself
to be God also. But in this case He is silent about His being man, because no one doubts
His being man, and with reason links Himself to God, that He might establish the formula
of His divinity5134 for those who should believe. If Christ was only man, how does He say,
“And now glorify me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was?”5135 If,
before the world was, He had glory with God, and maintained His glory with the Father,
He existed before the world, for He would not have had the glory unless He Himself had
existed before, so as to be able to keep the glory. For no one could possess anything, unless
he himself should first be in existence to keep anything. But now Christ has the glory before
the foundation of the world; therefore He Himself was before the foundation of the world.
For unless He were before the foundation of the world, He could not have glory before the
foundation of the world, since He Himself was not in existence. But indeed man could not
have glory before the foundation of the world, seeing that he was after the world; but Christ
had—therefore He was before the world. Therefore He was not man only, seeing that He
was before the world. He is therefore God, because He was before the world, and held His
glory before the world. Neither let this be explained by predestination, since this is not so
expressed, or let them add this who think so, but woe is denounced to them who add to,
even as to those who take away from, that which is written. Therefore that may not be said,
which may not be added. And thus, predestination being set aside, seeing it is not so laid
down, Christ was in substance before the foundation of the world. For He is “the Word by
which all things were made, and without which nothing was made.” Because even if He is
said to be glorious in predestination, and that this predestination was before the foundation
of the world, let order be maintained, and before Him a considerable number of men was
destined to glory. For in respect of that destination, Christ will be perceived to be less than
others if He is designated subsequent to them. For if this glory was in predestination, Christ
received that predestination to glory last of all; for prior to Him Adam will be seen to have
been predestinated, and Abel, and Enoch, and Noah, and Abraham, and many others. For

since with God the order of all, both persons and things, is arranged, many will be said to
have been predestinated before this predestination of Christ to glory. And on these terms
Christ is discovered to be inferior to other men, although He is really found to be better and
greater, and more ancient than the angels themselves. Either, then, let all these things be set
on one side, that Christ’s divinity may be destroyed; or if these things cannot be set aside,
let His proper divinity be attributed to Christ by the heretics.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.5136 Argument.—It Is, Moreover, Proved by Moses in the Beginning
of the Holy Scriptures.</head>
<p>What if Moses pursues this same rule of truth, and delivers to us in the beginning of
his sacred writings, this principle by which we may learn that all things were created and
founded by the Son of God, that is, by the Word of God? For He says the same that John
and the rest say; nay, both John and the others are perceived to have received from Him
what they say. For if John says, “All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing
made,”5137 the prophet David too says, “I tell my works to the King.”5138 Moses, moreover,
introduces God commanding that there should be light at the first, that the heaven should
be established, that the waters should be gathered into one place, that the dry land should
appear, that the fruit should be brought forth according to its seed, that the animals should
be produced, that lights should be established in heaven, and stars. He shows that none
other was then present to God—by whom these works were commanded that they should
be made—than He by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.
And if He is the Word of God—“for my heart has uttered forth a good Word”5139—He
shows that in the beginning the Word was, and that this Word was with the Father, and
besides that the Word was God, and that all things were made by Him. Moreover, this “Word
was made flesh and dwelt among us,”5140—to wit, Christ the Son of God; whom both on
receiving subsequently as man according to the flesh, and seeing before the foundation of
the world to be the Word of God, and God, we reasonably, according to the instruction of
the Old and New Testament, believe and hold to be as well God as man, Christ Jesus. What
if the same Moses introduces God saying, “Let us make man after our image and likeness;”5141
and below, “And God made man; in the image of God made He him, male and female made
He them?”5142 If, as we have already shown, it is the Son of God by whom all things were
made, certainly it was the Son of God by whom also man was ordained, on whose account
all things were made. Moreover, when God commands that man should be made, He is said
to be God who makes man; but the Son of God makes man, that is to say, the Word of God,
“by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.” And this Word
was made flesh, and dwelt among us: therefore Christ is God; therefore man was made by

Christ as by the Son of God. But God made man in the image of God; He is therefore God
who made man in the image of God; therefore Christ is God: so that with reason neither
does the testimony of the Old Testament waver concerning the person of Christ, being
supported by the manifestation of the New Testament; nor is the power of the New Testament
detracted from, while its truth is resting on the roots of the same Old Testament. Whence
they who presume Christ the Son of God and man to be only man, and not God also, do so
in opposition to both Old and New Testaments, in that they corrupt the authority and the
truth both of the Old and New Testaments. What if the same Moses everywhere introduces
God the Father infinite and without end, not as being enclosed in any place, but as one who
includes every place; nor as one who is in a place, but rather one in whom every place is,
containing all things and embracing all things, so that with reason He can neither descend
nor ascend, because He Himself both contains and fills all things, and yet nevertheless introduces
God descending to consider the tower which the sons of men were building, asking
and saying, “Come;” and then, “Let us go down and there confound their tongues, that each
one may not understand the words of his neighbour.”5143 Whom do they pretend here to
have been the God who descended to that tower, and asking to visit those men at that time?
God the Father? Then thus He is enclosed in a place; and how does He embrace all things?
Or does He say that it is an angel descending with angels, and saying, “Come;” and subsequently,
“Let us go down and there confound their tongues?” And yet in Deuteronomy
we observe that God told these things, and that God said, where it is written, “When He
scattered abroad the children of Adam, He determined the bounds of the nations according
to the number of the angels of God.”5144 Neither, therefore, did the Father descend, as the
subject itself indicates; nor did an angel command these things, as the fact shows. Then it
remains that He must have descended, of whom the Apostle Paul says, “He who descended
is the same who ascended above all the heavens, that He might fill all things,”5145 that is,
the Son of God, the Word of God. But the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among
us. This must be Christ. Therefore Christ must be declared to be God.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.5146 Argument.—Moreover Also, from the Fact that He Who Was
Seen of Abraham is Called God; Which Cannot Be Understood of the Father,
Whom No Man Hath Seen at Any Time; But of the Son in the Likeness of an
Angel.</head>
<p>Behold, the same Moses tells us in another place that “God was seen of Abraham.”5147
And yet the same Moses hears from God, that “no man can see God and live.”5148 If God
cannot be seen, how was God seen? Or if He was seen, how is it that He cannot be seen? For
John also says, “No man hath seen God at any time;”5149 and the Apostle Paul, “Whom no
man hath seen, nor can see.”5150 But certainly the Scripture does not lie; therefore, truly,
God was seen. Whence it may be understood that it was not the Father who was seen, seeing
that He never was seen; but the Son, who has both been accustomed to descend, and to be
seen because He has descended. For He is the image of the invisible God, as the imperfection
and frailty of the human condition was accustomed sometimes even then to see God the
Father in the image of God, that is, in the Son of God. For gradually and by progression
human frailty was to be strengthened by the image to that glory of being able one day to see
God the Father. For the things that are great are dangerous if they are sudden. For even the
sudden light of the sun after darkness, with its too great splendour, will not make manifest
the light of day to unaccustomed eyes, but will rather strike them with blindness.</p>
<p>And lest this should occur to the injury of human eyes, the darkness is broken up and
scattered by degrees; and the rising of that luminary, mounting by small and unperceived
increments, gently accustoms men’s eyes to bear its full orb by the gentle increase of its rays.
Thus, therefore, Christ also—that is, the image of God, and the Son of God—is looked upon
by men, inasmuch as He could be seen. And thus the weakness and imperfection of the
human destiny is nourished, led up, and educated by Him; so that, being accustomed to
look upon the Son, it may one day be able to see God the Father Himself also as He is, that
it may not be stricken by His sudden and intolerable brightness, and be hindered from being
able to see God the Father, whom it has always desired.5151 Wherefore it is the Son who is
seen; but the Son of God is the Word of God: and the Word of God was made flesh, and
dwelt among us; and this is Christ. What in the world is the reason that we should hesitate
to call Him God, who in so many ways is acknowledged to be proved God? And if, moreover,

the angel meets with Hagar, Sarah’s maid, driven from her home as well as turned away,
near the fountain of water in the way to Shur; asks and learns the reason of her flight, and
after that offers her advice that she should humble herself; and, moreover, gives her the
hope of the name of mother, and pledges and promises that from her womb there should
be a numerous seed, and that she should have Ishmael to be born from her; and with other
things unfolds the place of his habitation, and describes his mode of life; yet Scripture sets
forth this angel as both Lord and God—for He would not have promised the blessing of
seed unless the angel had also been God. Let them ask what the heretics can make of this
present passage. Was that the Father that was seen by Hagar or not? For He is declared to
be God. But far be it from us to call God the Father an angel, lest He should be subordinate
to another whose angel He would be. But they will say that it was an angel. How then shall
He be God if He was an angel? Since this name is nowhere conceded to angels, except that
on either side the truth compels us into this opinion, that we ought to understand it to have
been God the Son, who, because He is of God, is rightly called God, because He is the Son
of God. But, because He is subjected5152 to the Father, and the Announcer of the Father’s
will, He is declared to be the Angel of Great Counsel.5153 Therefore, although this passage
neither is suited to the person of the Father, lest He should be called an angel, nor to the
person of an angel, lest he should be called God; yet it is suited to the person of Christ that
He should be both God because He is the Son of God, and should be an angel because He
is the Announcer of the Father’s mind. And the heretics ought to understand that they are
setting themselves against the Scriptures, in that, while they say that they believe Christ to
have been also an angel, they are unwilling to declare Him to have been also God, when
they read in the Old Testament that He often came to visit the human race. To this, moreover,
Moses added the instance of God seen of Abraham at the oak of Mamre, when he was sitting
at the opening of his tent at noon-day. And nevertheless, although he had beheld three men,
note that he called one of them Lord; and when he had washed their feet, he offers them
bread baked on the ashes, with butter and abundance of milk itself, and urges them that,
being detained as guests, they should eat. And after this he hears also that he should be a
father, and learns that Sarah his wife should bring forth a son by him; and acknowledges
concerning the destruction of the people of Sodom, what they deserve to suffer; and learns
that God had come down on account of the cry of Sodom. In which place, if they will have
it that the Father was seen at that time to have been received with hospitality in company
with two angels, the heretics have believed the Father to be visible. But if an angel, although

of the three angels one is called Lord, why, although it is not usual, is an angel called God?
Unless because, in order that His proper invisibility may be restored to the Father, and the
proper inferiority5154 be remitted to the angel, it was only God the Son, who also is God,
who was seen by Abraham, and was believed to have been received with hospitality. For He
anticipated sacramentally what He was hereafter to become. He was made a guest of Abraham,
being about to be among the sons of Abraham. And his children’s feet, by way of
proving what He was, He washed; returning in the children the claim of hospitality which
formerly the Father had put out to interest to Him. Whence also, that there might be no
doubt but that it was He who was the guest of Abraham on the destruction of the people of
Sodom, it is declared: “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrha fire and
brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.”5155 For thus also said the prophet in the person
of God: “I have overthrown you, as the Lord overturned Sodom and Gomorrha.”5156
Therefore the Lord overturned Sodom, that is, God overturned Sodom; but in the overturning
of Sodom, the Lord rained fire from the Lord. And this Lord was the God seen by Abraham;
and this God was the guest of Abraham, certainly seen because He was also touched. But
although the Father, being invisible, was assuredly not at that time seen, He who was accustomed
to be touched and seen was seen and received to hospitality. But this the Son of God,
“The Lord rained from the Lord upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire.” And this
is the Word of God. And the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and this
is Christ. It was not the Father, then, who was a guest with Abraham, but Christ. Nor was
it the Father who was seen then, but the Son; and Christ was seen. Rightly, therefore, Christ
is both Lord and God, who was not otherwise seen by Abraham, except that as God the
Word He was begotten of God the Father before Abraham himself. Moreover, says the
Scripture, the same Angel and God visits and consoles the same Hagar when driven with
her son from the dwelling of Abraham. For when in the desert she had exposed the infant,
because the water had fallen short from the pitcher; and when the lad had cried out, and
she had lifted up her weeping and lamentation, “God heard,” says the Scripture, “the voice
of the lad from the place where he was.”5157 Having told that it was God who heard the
voice of the infant, it adds: “And the angel of the Lord called Hagar herself out of heaven,”
saying that that was an angel5158 whom it had called God, and pronouncing Him to be Lord
whom it had set forth as an angel; which Angel and God moreover promises to Hagar herself

greater consolations, in saying, “Fear not; for I have heard the voice of the lad from the place
where he was. Arise, take up the lad, and hold him; for I will make of him a great nation.”5159
Why does this angel, if angel only, claim to himself this right of saying, I will make of him
a great nation, since assuredly this kind of power belongs to God, and cannot belong to an
angel? Whence also He is confirmed to be God, since He is able to do this; because, by way
of proving this very point, it is immediately added by the Scripture: “And God opened her
eyes, and she saw a well of running water; and she went and filled the bottle from the well,
and gave to the lad: and God was with the lad.”5160 If, then, this God was with the Lord,
who opened the eyes of Hagar that she might see the well of running water, and might draw
the water on account of the urgent need of the lad’s thirst, and this God who calls her from
heaven is called an angel when, in previously hearing the voice of the lad crying, He was
rather God; is not understood to be other than angel, in like manner as He was God also.
And since this cannot be applicable or fitting to the Father, who is God only, but may be
applicable to Christ, who is declared to be not only God, but angel also,5161 it manifestly
appears that it was not the Father who thus spoke to Hagar, but rather Christ, since He is
God; and to Him also is applied the name of angel, since He became the “angel of great
counsel.”5162 And He is the angel, in that He declares the bosom of the Father, as John sets
forth. For if John himself says, that He Himself who sets forth the bosom of the Father, as
the Word, became flesh in order to declare the bosom of the Father, assuredly Christ is not
only man, but angel also; and not only angel, but He is shown by the Scriptures to be God
also. And this is believed to be the case by us; so that, if we will not consent to apprehend
that it was Christ who then spoke to Hagar, we must either make an angel God, or we must
reckon God the Father Almighty among the angels.5163</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.5164 Argument.—That God Also Appeared to Jacob as an Angel; Namely,
the Son of God.</head>
<p>What if in another place also we read in like manner that God was described as an angel?
For when, to his wives Leah and Rachel, Jacob complained of the injustice of their father,
and when he told them that he desired now to go and return into his own land, he moreover
interposed the authority of his dream; and at this time he says that the angel of God had
said to him in a dream, “Jacob, Jacob. And I said,” says he, “What is it? Lift up thine eyes,
said He, and see, the he-goats and the rams leaping upon the sheep, and the she-goats are
black and white, and many-coloured, and grizzled, and speckled: for I have seen all that
Laban hath done to thee. I am God, who appeared to thee in the place of God, where thou
anointedst for me there the standing stone, and there vowedst a vow unto me: now therefore
arise, and go forth from this land, and go unto the land of thy nativity, and I will be with
thee.”5165 If the Angel of God speaks thus to Jacob, and the Angel himself mentions and
says, “I am God, who appeared unto thee in the house of God,” we see without any hesitation
that this is declared to be not only an angel, but God also; because He speaks of the vow
directed to Himself by Jacob in the place of God, and He does not say, in my place. It is then
the place of God, and He also is God. Moreover, it is written simply in the place of God,
for it is not said in the place of the angel and God, but only of God; and He who promises
those things is manifested to be both God and Angel, so that reasonably there must be a
distinction between Him who is called God only, and Him who is declared to be not God
simply, but Angel also. Whence if so great an authority cannot here be regarded as belonging
to any other angel, that He should also avow Himself to be God, and should bear witness
that a vow was made to Him, except to Christ alone, to whom not as angel only, but as to
God, a vow can be vowed; it is manifest that it is not to be received as the Father, but as the
Son, God and Angel.5166 Moreover, if this is Christ, as it is, he is in terrible risk who says
that Christ is either man or angel alone, withholding from Him the power of the divine
name,—an authority which He has constantly received on the faith of the heavenly Scriptures,
which continually say that He is both Angel and God. To all these things, moreover, is added
this, that in like manner as the divine Scripture has frequently declared Him both Angel
and God, so the same divine Scripture declares Him also both man and God, expressing
thereby what He should be, and depicting even then in figure what He was to be in the truth
of His substance. “For,” it says, “Jacob remained alone; and there wrestled with him a man
even till daybreak. And He saw that He did not prevail against him; and He touched the

broad part of Jacob’s thigh while He was wrestling with him and he with Him, and said to
him, Let me go, for the morning has dawned. And he said, I will not let Thee go, except
Thou bless me. And He said, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And He said to him,
Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; because thou hast
prevailed with God, and thou art powerful with men.”5167 And it adds, moreover: “And
Jacob called the name of that place the Vision of God: for I have seen the Lord face to face,
and my soul has been made safe. And the sun arose upon him. Afterwards he crossed over
the Vision of God, but he halted upon his thigh.”5168 A man, it says, wrestled with Jacob.
If this was a mere man, who is he? Whence is he? Wherefore does he contend and wrestle
with Jacob? What had intervened? What had happened? What was the cause of so great a
dispute as that, and so great a struggle? Why, moreover, is Jacob, who is found to be strong
enough to hold the man with whom he is wrestling, and asks for a blessing from Him whom
he is holding, asserted to have asked therefore, except because this struggle was prefigured
as that which should be between Christ and the sons of Jacob, which is said to be completed
in the Gospel? For against this man Jacob’s people struggled, in which struggle Jacob’s people
was found to be the more powerful, because against Christ it gained the victory of its iniquity:
at which time, on account of the crime that it committed, hesitating and giving way, it began
most sorely to halt in the walk of its own faith and salvation; and although it was found the
stronger, in respect of the condemnation of Christ, it still needs His mercy, still needs His
blessing. But, moreover, the man who wrestled with Jacob says, “Moreover, thy name shall
no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name;” and if Israel is the man who sees
God, the Lord was beautifully showing that it was not only a man who was then wrestling
with Jacob, but God also. Certainly Jacob saw God, with whom he wrestled, although he
was holding the man in his own struggle. And in order that there might still be no hesitation,
He Himself laid down the interpretation by saying, “Because thou hast prevailed with God,
and art powerful with men.” For which reason the same Jacob, perceiving already the force
of the Mystery, and apprehending the authority of Him with whom he had wrestled, called
the name of that place in which he had wrestled, the Vision of God. He, moreover, superadded
the reason for his interpretation being offered of the Vision of God: “For I have seen,”
said he, “God face to face, and my soul has been saved.” Moreover, he saw God, with whom
he wrestled as with a man; but still indeed he held the man as a conqueror, though as an
inferior he asked a blessing as from God. Thus he wrestled with God and with man; and
thus truly was that struggle prefigured, and in the Gospel was fulfilled, between Christ and
the people of Jacob, wherein, although the people had the mastery, yet it proved to be inferior
by being shown to be guilty. Who will hesitate to acknowledge that Christ, in whom this

type of a wrestling was fulfilled, was not man only, but God also, since even that very type
of a wrestling seems to have proved Him man and God? And yet, even after this, the same
divine Scripture justly does not cease to call the Angel God, and to pronounce God the
Angel. For when this very Jacob was about to bless Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of
Joseph, with his hands placed across on the heads of the lads, he said, “The God which fed
me from my youth even unto this day, the Angel who delivered me from all evils, bless these
lads.”5169 Even to such a point does he affirm the same Being to be an Angel, whom he had
called God, as in the end of his discourse, to express the person of whom he was speaking
as one, when he said5170 “bless these lads.” For if he had meant the one to be understood
as God, and the other as an angel, he would have comprised the two persons in the plural
number; but now he defined the singular number of one person in the blessing, whence he
meant it to be understood that the same person is God and Angel. But yet He cannot be
received as God the Father; but as God and Angel, as Christ He can be received. And Him,
as the author of this blessing, Jacob also signified by placing his hands crossed upon the
lads, as if their father was Christ, and showing, from thus placing his hands, the figure and
future form of the passion.5171 Let no one, therefore, who does not shrink from speaking
of Christ as an Angel, thus shrink from pronouncing Him God also, when he perceives that
He Himself was invoked in the blessing of these lads, by the sacrament of the passion, intimated
in the type of the crossed hands, as both God and Angel.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.5172 Argument.—It is Proved from the Scriptures that Christ Was Called
an Angel. But Yet It is Shown from Other Parts of Holy Scripture that He is God
Also.</head>
<p>But if some heretic, obstinately struggling against the truth, should persist in all these
instances either in understanding that Christ was properly an angel, or should contend that
He must be so understood, he must in this respect also be subdued by the force of truth.
For if, since all heavenly things, earthly things, and things under the earth, are subjected to
Christ, even the angels themselves, with all other creatures, as many as are subjected to
Christ, are called gods,5173 rightly also Christ is God. And if any angel at all subjected to
Christ can be called God, and this, if it be said, is also professed without blasphemy, certainly
much more can this be fitting for Christ, Himself the Son of God, for Him to be pronounced
God. For if an angel who is subjected to Christ is exalted as God, much more, and more
consistently, shall Christ, to whom all angels are subjected, be said to be God. For it is not
suitable to nature, that what is conceded to the lesser should be denied to the greater. Thus,
if an angel be inferior to Christ, and yet an angel is called god, rather by consequence is
Christ said to be God, who is discovered to be both greater and better, not than one, but
than all angels. And if “God standeth in the assembly of the gods, and in the midst God
distinguisheth between the gods,”5174 and Christ stood at various times in the synagogue,
then Christ stood in the synagogue as God,—judging, to wit, between the gods, to whom
He says, “How long do ye accept the persons of men?” That is to say, consequently, charging
the men of the synagogue with not practising just judgments. Further, if they who are reproved
and blamed seem even for any reason to attain this name without blasphemy, that
they should be called gods, assuredly much more shall He be esteemed God, who not only
is said to have stood as God in the synagogue of the gods, but moreover is revealed by the
same authority of the reading as distinguishing and judging between gods. But even if they
who “fall like one of the princes” are still called gods, much rather shall He be said to be
God, who not only does not fall like one of the princes, but even overcomes both the author
and prince of wickedness himself. And what in the world is the reason, that although they
say that this name was given even to Moses, since it is said, “I have made thee as a god to
Pharaoh,”5175 it should be denied to Christ, who is declared to be ordained5176 not to
Pharaoh only, but to every creature, as both Lord and God? And in the former case indeed

time. But if he who has received the power of one man, in respect to this limited power
given him, still without hesitation attains that name of God, how much more shall He who
has power over Moses himself as well be believed to have attained the authority of that
name?</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.5179 Argument.—That the Same Divine Majesty is Again Confirmed
in Christ by Other Scriptures.</head>
<p>And indeed I could set forth the treatment of this subject by all heavenly Scriptures,
and set in motion, so to speak, a perfect forest of texts concerning that manifestation of the
divinity of Christ, except that I have not so much undertaken to speak against this special
form of heresy, as to expound the rule of truth concerning the person of Christ. Although,
however, I must hasten to other matters, I do not think that I must pass over this point, that
in the Gospel the Lord declared, by way of signifying His majesty, saying, “Destroy this
temple, and in three days I will build it up again.”5180 Or when, in another passage, and on
another subject, He declares, “I have power to lay down my life, and again to take it up; for
this commandment I have received of my Father.”5181 Now who is it who says that He can
lay down His life, or can Himself recover His life again, because He has received it of His
Father? Or who says that He can again resuscitate and rebuild the destroyed temple of His
body, except because He is the Word who is from the Father, who is with the Father, “by
whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made;”5182 the imitator5183
of His Father’s works and powers, “the image of the invisible God;”5184 “who came down
from heaven;”5185 who testified what things he had seen and heard; who “came not to do
His own will, but rather to do the will of the Father,”5186 by whom He had been sent for

because He is the Son of God? And if by the apostle Christ is called “the first-born of every

to His divinity the Word proceeded from the Father before every creature? And unless the
heretics receive it thus, they will be constrained to show that Christ the man was the firstborn
of every creature; which they will not be able to do. Either, therefore, He is before every
creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because
man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature. And how is
He the first-born of every creature, except because being that Word which is before every
creature; and therefore, the first-born of every creature, He becomes flesh and dwells in us,
that is, assumes that man’s nature which is after every creature, and so dwells with him and
in him, in us, that neither is humanity taken away from Christ, nor His divinity denied? For
if He is only before every creature, humanity is taken away from Him; but if He is only man,
the divinity which is before every creature is interfered with. Both of these, therefore, are
leagued together in Christ, and both are conjoined, and both are linked with one another.
And rightly, as there is in Him something which excels the creature, the agreement of the
divinity and the humanity seems to be pledged in Him: for which reason He who is declared
as made the “Mediator between God and man”5189 is revealed to have associated in Himself
God and man. And if the same apostle says of Christ, that “having put off the flesh, He
spoiled powers, they being openly triumphed over in Himself,”5190 he certainly did not
without a meaning propound that the flesh was put off, unless because he wished it to be
understood that it was again put on also at the resurrection. Who, therefore, is He that thus
put off and put on the flesh? Let the heretics seek out. For we know that the Word of God
was invested with the substance of flesh, and that He again was divested of the same bodily
material, which again He took up in the resurrection and resumed as a garment. And yet
Christ could neither have been divested of nor invested with manhood, had He been only
man: for man is never either deprived of nor invested with himself. For that must be something
else, whatever it may be, which by any other is either taken away or put on. Whence,
reasonably, it was the Word of God who put off the flesh, and again in the resurrection put
it on, since He put it off because at His birth He had been invested with it. Therefore in
Christ it is God who is invested, and moreover must be divested, because He who is invested
must also likewise be He who is divested; whereas, as man, He is invested with and divested
of, as it were, a certain tunic of the compacted body.5191 And therefore by consequence He
was, as we have said, the Word of God, who is revealed to be at one time invested, at another
time divested of the flesh. For this, moreover, He before predicted in blessings: “He shall
wash His garment in wine, and His clothing in the blood of the grape.”5192 If the garment

in Christ be the flesh, and the clothing itself be the body, let it be asked who is He whose
body is clothing, and garment flesh? For to us it is evident that the flesh is the garment, and
the body the clothing of the Word; and He washed His bodily substance, and purified the
material of the flesh in blood, that is, in wine, by His passion, in the human character that
He had undertaken. Whence, if indeed He is washed, He is man, because the garment which
is washed is the flesh; but He who washes is the Word of God, who, in order that He might
wash the garment, was made the taker-up of the garment. Rightly, from that substance
which is taken that it might be washed, He is revealed as a man, even as from the authority
of the Word who washed it He is manifested to be God.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.5193 Argument—That the Same Divine Majesty is in Christ, He Once
More Asserts by Other Scriptures.</head>
<p>But why, although we appear to hasten to another branch of the argument, should we
pass over that passage in the apostle: “Who, although He was in the form of God, did not
think it robbery that He should be equal with God; but emptied Himself, taking up the form
of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and found in fashion as a man, He humbled
Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore also
God hath highly exalted Him, and hath given Him a name which is above every name; that
in the name of Jesus every knee should be bent, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and
things under the earth; and every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord, in the glory of
God the Father?”5194 “Who, although He was in the form of God,” he says. If Christ had
been only man, He would have been spoken of as in “the image” of God, not “in the form”
of God. For we know that man was made after the image or likeness, not after the form, of
God. Who then is that angel who, as we have said, was made in the form of God? But neither
do we read of the form of God in angels, except because this one is chief and royal above
all—the Son of God, the Word of God, the imitator of all His Father’s works, in that He
Himself worketh even as His Father. He is—as we have declared—in the form of God the
Father. And He is reasonably affirmed to be in the form of God, in that He Himself, being
above all things, and having the divine power over every creature, is also God after the example
of the Father. Yet He obtained this from His own Father, that He should be both God
of all and should be Lord, and be begotten and made known from Himself as God in the
form of God the Father. He then, although He was in the form of God, thought it not robbery
that He should be equal with God. For although He remembered that He was God from
God the Father, He never either compared or associated Himself with God the Father,
mindful that He was from His Father, and that He possessed that very thing that He is, because
the Father had given it Him.5195 Thence, finally, both before the assumption of the
flesh, and moreover after the assumption of the body, besides, after the resurrection itself,
He yielded all obedience to the Father, and still yields it as ever. Whence it is proved that
He thought that the claim of a certain divinity would be robbery, to wit, that of equalling
Himself with God the Father; but, on the other hand, obedient and subject to all His rule
and will, He even was contented to take on Him the form of a servant—that is, to become
man; and the substance of flesh and body which, as it came to Him from the bondage of
His forefathers’ sins according to His manhood, He undertook by being born, at which time
moreover He emptied Himself, in that He did not refuse to take upon Him the frailty incident

to humanity. Because if He had been born man only, He would not have been emptied in
respect of this; for man, being born, is increased, not emptied. For in beginning to be that
which He could not possess, so long as He did not exist, as we have said, He is not emptied,
but is rather increased and enriched. But if Christ is emptied in being born, in taking the
form of a servant, how is He man only? Of whom it could more truly have been said that
He was enriched, not emptied, at the time that He was born, except because the authority
of the divine Word, reposing for awhile in taking upon itself humanity, and not exercising
itself with its real strength, casts itself down, and puts itself off for the time, in bearing the
humanity which it has undertaken? It empties itself in descending to injuries and reproaches,
in bearing abominations, in experiencing things unworthy; and yet of this humility there is
present at once an eminent reward. For He has “received a name which is above every name,”
which assuredly we understand to be none other than the name of God. For since it belongs
to God alone to be above all things, it follows that the name which is that God’s who is above
all things, is above every name; which name by consequence is certainly His who, although
He was “in the form of God, thought it not robbery for Him to be equal with God.” For
neither, if Christ were not God, would every knee bend itself in His name, “of things in
heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;” nor would things visible and invisible,
even every creature of all things, be subjected or be placed under man, when they might
remember that they were before man. Whence, since Christ is said to be in the form of God,
and since it is shown that for His nativity according to the flesh He emptied Himself; and
since it is declared that He received from the Father that name which is above every name;
and since it is shown that in His name “every knee of things in heaven, and things in earth,
and things under the earth, bend and bow” themselves; and this very thing is asserted to be
a furtherance of the glory of God the Father; consequently He is not man only, from the
fact that He became obedient to the Father, even to death, yea, the death of the cross; but,
moreover, from the proclamation by these higher matters of the divinity of Christ, Christ
Jesus is shown to be Lord and God, which the heretics will not have.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.5196 Argument.—And This is So Manifest, that Some Heretics Have
Thought Him to Be God the Father, Others that He Was Only God Without the
Flesh.</head>
<p>In this place I may be permitted also to collect arguments from the side of other heretics.
It is a substantial kind of proof which is gathered even from an adversary, so as to prove the
truth even from the very enemies of truth. For it is so far manifest that He is declared in the
Scriptures to be God, that many heretics, moved by the magnitude and truth of this divinity,
exaggerating His honours above measure, have dared to announce or to think Him not the
Son, but God the Father Himself.5197 And this, although it is contrary to the truth of the
Scriptures, is still a great and excellent argument for the divinity of Christ, who is so far
God, except as Son of God, born of God, that very many heretics—as we have said—have
so accepted Him as God, as to think that He must be pronounced not the Son, but the
Father. Therefore let it be considered whether He is God or not, since His authority has so
affected some, that, as we have already said above, they have thought Him God the Father
Himself, and have confessed the divinity in Christ with such impetuosity and effusion—compelled
to it by the manifest divinity in Christ—that they thought that He whom they read
of as the Son, because they perceived Him to be God, must be the Father. Moreover, other
heretics have so far embraced the manifest divinity of Christ, as to say that He was without
flesh, and to withdraw from Him the whole humanity which He took upon Him, lest, by
associating with Him a human nativity, as they conceived it, they should diminish in Him
the power of the divine name.5198 This, however, we do not approve; but we quote it as an
argument to prove that Christ is God, to this extent, that some, taking away the manhood,
have thought Him God only, and some have thought Him God the Father Himself; when
reason and the proportion of the heavenly Scriptures show Christ to be God, but as the Son
of God; and the Son of man, having been taken up, moreover by God, that He must be believed
to be man also. Because if He came to man, that He might be Mediator of God and
men, it behoved Him to be with man, and the Word to be made flesh, that in His own self
He might link together the agreement of earthly things with heavenly things, by associating
in Himself pledges of both natures, and uniting God to man and man to God; so that reasonably
the Son of God might be made by the assumption of flesh the Son of man, and the
Son of man by the reception of the Word of God the Son of God. This most profound and
recondite mystery, destined before the worlds for the salvation of the human race, is found
to be fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ, both God and man, that the human race might be
placed within the reach of the enjoyment of eternal salvation.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.5199 Argument.—That These Have Therefore Erred, by Thinking
that There Was No Difference Between the Son of God and the Son of Man;
Because They Have Ill Understood the Scripture.</head>
<p>But the material of that heretical error has arisen, as I judge, from this, that they think
that there is no distinction between the Son of God and the Son of man; because if a distinction
were made, Jesus Christ would easily be proved to be both man and God. For they will
have it that the self-same that is man, the Son of man, appears also as the Son of God; that
man and flesh and that same frail substance may be said to be also the Son of God Himself.
Whence, since no distinction is discerned between the Son of man and the Son of God, but
the Son of man Himself is asserted to be the Son of God, the same Christ and the Son of
God is asserted to be man only; by which they strive to exclude, “The Word was made flesh,
and dwelt among us.”5200 “And ye shall call His name Emmanuel; which is, interpreted,
God with us.”5201 For they propose and put forward what is told in the Gospel of Luke,
whence they strive to maintain not what is the truth, but only what they want it to be: “The
Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee;
therefore also the Holy Thing which is born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”5202 If,
then, say they, the angel of God says to Mary, “that Holy Thing which is born of thee,” the
substance of flesh and body is of Mary; but he has set forth that this substance, that is, that
Holy Thing which is born of her, is the Son of God. Man, say they, himself, and that bodily
flesh; that which is called holy, itself is the Son of God. That also when the Scripture says
that “Holy Thing,” we should understand thereby Christ the man, the Son of man; and when
it places before us the Son of God, we ought to perceive, not man, but God. And yet the divine
Scripture easily convicts and discloses the frauds and artifices of the heretics. For if it were
thus only, “The Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee; therefore that Holy Thing which is born of thee shall be called the Son of God,” perchance
we should have had to strive against them in another sort, and to have sought for
other arguments, and to have taken up other weapons, with which to overcome both their
snares and their wiles; but since the Scripture itself, abounding in heavenly fulness, divests
itself of the calumnies of these heretics, we easily depend upon that that is written, and
overcome those errors without any hesitation. For it said, not as we have already stated,
“Therefore the Holy Thing which shall be born of thee;” but added the conjunction, for it
says, “Therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee,” so as to make it plain
that that Holy Thing which is born of her—that is, that substance of flesh and body—is not

<pb n="1514"/>
the Son of God primarily, but consequently, and in the secondary place;5203 but primarily,
that the Son of God is the Word of God, incarnate by that Spirit of whom the angel says,
“The Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.” For
He is the legitimate Son of God who is of God Himself; and He, while He assumes that Holy
Thing, and links to Himself the Son of man, and draws Him and transfers Him to Himself,
by His connection and mingling of association becomes responsible for and makes Him the
Son of God, which by nature He was not, so that the original cause5204 of that name Son of
God is in the Spirit of the Lord, who descended and came, and that there is only the continuance
of the name in the case of the Son of man;5205 and by consequence He reasonably became
the Son of God, although originally He is not the Son of God. And therefore the angel,
seeing that arrangement, and providing for that order of the mystery, did not confuse every
thing in such a way as to leave no trace of a distinction, but established the distinction by
saying, “Therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God;” lest, had he not arranged that distribution with his balances, but had left the matter
all mixed up in confusion, it had really afforded occasion to heretics to declare that the Son
of man, in that He is man, is the same as the Son of God and man. But now, explaining
severally the ordinance and the reason of so great a mystery, he evidently set forth in saying,
“And that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God;” the proof
that the Son of God descended, and that He, in taking up into Himself the Son of man,
consequently made Him the Son of God, because the Son of God associated and joined Him
to Himself. So that, while the Son of man cleaves in His nativity to the Son of God, by that
very mingling He holds that as pledged and derived which of His own nature He could not
possess. And thus by the word of the angel the distinction is made, against the desire of the
heretics, between the Son of God and man; yet with their association, by pressing them to
understand that Christ the Son of man is man, and also to receive the Son of God and man
the Son of God; that is, the Word of God as it is written as God; and thus to acknowledge
that Christ Jesus the Lord, connected on both sides, so to speak, is on both sides woven in
and grown together, and associated in the same agreement of both substances, by the
binding to one another of a mutual alliance—man and God by the truth of the Scripture
which declares this very thing.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.5206 Argument.—And that It Does Not Follow Thence, that Because
Christ Died It Must Also Be Received that God Died; For Scripture Sets Forth
that Not Only Was Christ God, But Man Also.</head>
<p>Therefore, say they, if Christ is not man only, but God also—and Scripture tells us that
He died for us, and was raised again—then Scripture teaches us to believe that God died;
or if God does not die, and Christ is said to have died, then Christ will not be God, because
God cannot be admitted to have died. If they ever could understand or had understood what
they read, they would never speak after such a perilous fashion. But the folly of error is always
hasty in its descent, and it is no new thing if those who have forsaken the lawful faith descend
even to perilous results. For if Scripture were to set forth that Christ is God only, and that
there was no association of human weakness mingled in His nature, this intricate argument
of theirs might reasonably avail something. If Christ is God, and Christ died, then God died.
But when Scripture determines, as we have frequently shown, that He is not only God, but
man also, it follows that what is immortal may be held to have remained uncorrupted. For
who cannot understand that the divinity is impassible, although the human weakness is liable
to suffering? When, therefore, Christ is understood to be mingled and associated as well of
that which God is, as of that which man is—for “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in
us”—who cannot easily apprehend of himself, without any teacher and interpreter, that it
was not that in Christ that died which is God, but that in Him died which is man? For what
if the divinity in Christ does not die, but the substance of the flesh only is destroyed, when
in other men also, who are not flesh only, but flesh and soul, the flesh indeed alone suffers
the inroads of wasting and death, while the soul is seen to be uncorrupted, and beyond the
laws of destruction and death? For this also our Lord Himself said, exhorting us to martyrdom
and to contempt of all human power: “Fear not those who slay the body, but cannot kill the
soul.”5207 But if the immortal soul cannot be killed or slain in any other, although the body
and flesh by itself can be slain, how much rather assuredly could not the Word of God and
God in Christ be put to death at all, although the flesh alone and the body was slain! For if
in any man whatever, the soul has this excellence of immortality that it cannot be slain,
much more has the nobility of the Word of God this power of not being slain. For if the
power of men fails to slay the sacred power of God, and if the cruelty of man fails to destroy
the soul, much more ought it to fail to slay the Word of God. For as the soul itself, which
was made by the Word of God, is not killed by men, certainly much rather will it be believed
that the Word of God cannot be destroyed. And if the sanguinary cruelty of men cannot do
more against men than only to slay the body, how much more certainly it will not have
power against Christ beyond in the same way slaying the body! So that, while from these
<note type="footnote">5206 According to Pamelius, ch. xx.</note>
<note type="footnote">5207 Matt. x. 28.</note>

<pb n="1516"/>
considerations it is gathered that nothing but the human nature in Christ was put to death,
it appears that the Word in Him was not drawn down into mortality. For if Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob, who, it is admitted, were only men, are manifested to be alive—for all
they,5208 says He, “live unto God;” and death in them does not destroy the soul, although
it dissolves the bodies themselves: for it could exercise its power on the bodies, it did not
avail to exercise it on the souls: for the one in them was mortal, and therefore died; the
other in them was immortal, and therefore is understood not to have been extinguished:
for which reason they are affirmed and said to live unto God,—much rather death in Christ
could have power against the material of His body alone, while against the divinity of the
Word it could not bring itself to bear. For the power of death is broken when the authority
of immortality intervenes.</p>

<p>But from this occasion of Christ being proved from the sacred authority of the divine
writings not man only, but God also, other heretics, breaking forth, contrive to impair the
religious position in Christ; by this very fact wishing to show that Christ is God the Father,
in that He is asserted to be not man only, but also is declared to be God. For thus say they,
If it is asserted that God is one, and Christ is God, then say they, If the Father and Christ be
one God, Christ will be called the Father. Wherein they are proved to be in error, not
knowing Christ, but following the sound of a name; for they are not willing that He should
be the second person after the Father, but the Father Himself. And since these things are
easily answered, few words shall be said. For who does not acknowledge that the person of
the Son is second after the Father, when he reads that it was said by the Father, consequently
to the Son, “Let us make man in our image and our likeness;”5210 and that after this it was

endeavour to gather together all the passages5226 whatever on this side; since the divine
Scripture, not so much of the Old as also of the New Testament, everywhere shows Him to
be born of the Father, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made,
who always has obeyed and obeys the Father; that He always has power over all things, but
as delivered, as granted, as by the Father Himself permitted to Him. And what can be so
evident proof that this is not the Father, but the Son; as that He is set forth as being obedient
to God the Father, unless, if He be believed to be the Father, Christ may be said to be subjected
to another God the Father?</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.5227 Argument.—He Skilfully Replies to a Passage Which the Heretics
Employed in Defence of Their Own Opinion.</head>
<p>But since they frequently urge upon us the passage where it is said, “I and the Father
are one,”5228 in this also we shall overcome them with equal facility. For if, as the heretics
think, Christ were the Father, He ought to have said, “I and the Father are one.”5229 But
when He says I, and afterwards introduces the Father by saying, “I and the Father,” He severs
and distinguishes the peculiarity of His, that is, the Son’s person, from the paternal authority,
not only in respect of the sound of the name, but moreover in respect of the order of the
distribution of power, since He might have said, “I the Father,” if He had had it in mind
that He Himself was the Father. And since He said “one” thing, let the heretics understand
that He did not say “one” person. For one placed in the neuter, intimates the social concord,
not the personal unity. He is said to be one neuter, not one masculine, because the expression
is not referred to the number, but it is declared with reference to the association of another.
Finally, He adds, and says, “We are,” not “I am,” so as to show, by the fact of His saying “I
and the Father are,” that they are two persons. Moreover, that He says one,5230 has reference
to the agreement, and to the identity of judgment, and to the loving association itself, as
reasonably the Father and Son are one in agreement, in love, and in affection; and because
He is of the Father, whatsoever He is, He is the Son; the distinction however remaining, that
He is not the Father who is the Son, because He is not the Son who is the Father. For He
would not have added “We are,” if He had had it in mind that He, the only and sole Father,
had become the Son. In fine, the Apostle Paul also apprehended this agreement of unity,
with the distinction of persons notwithstanding: for in writing to the Corinthians he said,
“I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. Therefore neither is he that
planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God who gives the increase. Now he that
planteth and he that watereth are one.”5231 And who does not perceive that Apollos is one
person and Paul another, and that Apollos and Paul are not one and the same person?
Moreover, also, the offices mentioned of each one of them are different; for one is he who
plants, and another he who waters. The Apostle Paul, however, put forward these two not
as being one person, but as being “one;” so that although Apollos indeed is one, and Paul
another, so far as respects the distinction of persons, yet as far as respects their agreement
both are “one.” For when two persons have one judgment, one truth, one faith, one and the
same religion, one fear of God also, they are one even although they are two persons: they

are the same, in that they have the same mind. Since those whom the consideration of person
divides from one another, these same again are brought together as one by the consideration
of religion. And although they are not actually the self-same people, yet in feeling the same,
they are the same; and although they are two, are still one, as having an association in faith,
even although they bear diversity in persons. Besides, when at these words of the Lord the
Jewish ignorance had been aroused, so that hastily they ran to take up stones, and said, “For
a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because thou, being a man, makest
thyself God,”5232 the Lord established the distinction, in giving them the principle on which
He had either said that He was God, or wished it to be understood, and says, “Say ye of Him,
whom the Father sanctified, and sent into this world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I
am the Son of God?”5233 Even here also He said that He had the Father. He is therefore the
Son, not the Father: for He would have confessed that He was the Father had He considered
Himself to be the Father; and He declares that He was sanctified by His Father. In receiving,
then, sanctification from the Father, He is inferior to the Father. Now, consequently, He
who is inferior to the Father, is not the Father, but the Son; for had He been the Father, He
would have given, and not received, sanctification. Now, however, by declaring that He has
received sanctification from the Father, by the very fact of proving Himself to be less than
the Father, by receiving from Him sanctification, He has shown that He is the Son, and not
the Father. Besides, He says that He is sent: so that by that obedience wherewith the Lord
Christ came, being sent, He might be proved to be not the Father, but the Son, who assuredly
would have sent had He been the Father; but being sent, He was not the Father, lest the
Father should be proved, in being sent, to be subjected to another God. And still after this
He added what might dissolve all ambiguity, and quench all the controversy of error: for
He says, in the last portion of His discourse, “Ye say, Thou blasphemest, because I said I am
the Son of God.” Therefore if He plainly testifies that He is the Son of God, and not the
Father, it is an instance of great temerity and excessive madness to stir up a controversy of
divinity and religion, contrary to the testimony of the Lord Christ Himself, and to say that
Christ Jesus is the Father, when it is observed that He has proved Himself to be, not the
Father, but the Son.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII. Argument.—He Proves Also that the Words Spoken to Philip
Make Nothing for the Sabellians.</head>
<p>Hereto also I will add that view wherein the heretic, while he rejoices as if at the loss of
some power of seeing special truth and light, acknowledges the total blindness of his error.
For again and again, and frequently, he objects that it was said, “Have I been so long time
with you, and do ye not know me, Philip? He who hath seen me, hath seen the Father
also.”5234 But let him learn what he does not understand. Philip is reproved, and rightly,
and deservedly indeed, because he has said, “Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth
us.”5235 For when had he either heard from Christ, or learnt that Christ was the Father? although,
on the other hand, he had frequently heard, and had often learned, rather that He
was the Son, not that He was the Father. For what the Lord said, “If ye have known me, ye
have known my Father also: and henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him,”5236
He said not as wishing to be understood Himself to be the Father, but implying that he who
thoroughly, and fully, and with all faith and all religiousness, drew near to the Son of God,
by all means shall attain, through the Son Himself, in whom he thus believes, to the Father,
and shall see Him. “For no one,” says He, “can come to the Father, but by me.”5237 And
therefore he shall not only come to God the Father, and shall know the Father Himself; but,
moreover, he ought thus to hold, and so to presume in mind and heart, that he has henceforth
not only known, but seen the Father. For often the divine Scripture announces things that
are not yet done as being done, because thus they shall be; and things which by all means
have to happen, it does not predict as if they were future, but narrates as if they were done.
And thus, although Christ had not been born as yet in the times of Isaiah the prophet, he
said, “For unto us a child is born;”5238 and although Mary had not yet been approached, he
said, “And I approached unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.”5239 And
when Christ had not yet made known the mind of the Father, it is said, “And His name shall
be called the Angel of Great Counsel.”5240 And when He had not yet suffered, he declared,
“He is as a sheep led to the slaughter.”5241 And although the cross had never yet existed, He
said, “All day long have I stretched out my hands to an unbelieving people.”5242 And although

not yet had He been scornfully given to drink, the Scripture says, “In my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink.”5243 And although He had not yet been stripped, He said, “Upon my
vesture they did cast lots, and they numbered my bones: they pierced my hands and my
feet.”5244 For the divine Scripture, foreseeing, speaks of things which it knows shall be as
being already done, and speaks of things as perfected which it regards as future, but which
shall come to pass without any doubt. And thus the Lord in the present passage said,
“Henceforth ye have known and have seen Him.” Now He said that the Father should be
seen by whomsoever had followed the Son, not as if the Son Himself should be the Father
seen, but that whosoever was willing to follow Him, and be His disciple, should obtain the
reward of being able to see the Father. For He also is the image of God the Father; so that
it is added, moreover, to these things, that “as the Father worketh, so also the Son worketh.”
5245 And the Son is an imitator5246 of all the Father’s works, so that every one may
regard it just as if he saw the Father, when he sees Him who always imitates the invisible
Father in all His works. But if Christ is the Father Himself, in what manner does He immediately
add, and say, “Whosoever believeth in me, the works that I do he shall do also; and
greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father?”5247 And He further subjoins,
“If ye love me, keep my commandments; and I will ask the Father, and He will give you
another Comforter.”5248 After which also He adds this: “If any one loveth me, he shall keep
my word: and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and will make our
abode with him.”5249 Moreover, also, He added this too: “But the Advocate, that Holy
Spirit whom the Father will send, He will teach you, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you.”5250 He utters, further, that passage when He
shows Himself to be the Son, and reasonably subjoins, and says, “If ye loved me, ye would
rejoice because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.”5251 But what shall we
say when He also continues in these words: “I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that
beareth fruit He purgeth, that it may bring forth more fruit?”5252 Still He persists, and adds:

“As the Father hath loved me, so also have I loved you: remain in my love. If ye have kept
my commandments, ye shall remain in my love; even as I have kept the Father’s commandments,
and remain in His love.”5253 Further, He says in addition: “But I have called you
friends; for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.”5254
Moreover, He adds to all this: “But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake,
because they know not Him that sent me.”5255 These things then, after the former, evidently
attesting Him to be not the Father but the Son, the Lord would never have added, if He had
had it in mind, either that He was the Father, or wished Himself to be understood as the
Father, except that He might declare this, that every man ought henceforth to consider, in
seeing the image of God the Father through the Son, that it was as if he saw the Father; since
every one believing on the Son may be exercised in the contemplation of the likeness, so
that, being accustomed to seeing the divinity in likeness, he may go forward, and grow even
to the perfect contemplation of God the Father Almighty. And since he who has imbibed
this truth into his mind and soul, and has believed of all things that thus it shall be, he shall
even now see, as it were, in some measure the Father whom he will see hereafter; and he
may so regard it, as if he actually held, what he knows for certain that he shall one day hold.
But if Christ Himself had been the Father, why did He promise as future, a reward which
He had already granted and given? For that He says, “Blessed are they of a pure heart, for
they shall see God,”5256 it is understood to promise the contemplation and vision of the
Father; therefore He had not given this; for why should He promise if He had already given?
For He had given if He was the Father: for He was seen, and He was touched. But since,
when Christ Himself is seen and touched, He still promises, and says that he who is of a
pure heart shall see God, He proves by this very saying that He who was then present was
not the Father, seeing that He was seen, and yet promised that whoever should be of a pure
heart should see the Father. It was therefore not the Father, but the Son, who promised this,
because He who was the Son promised that which had yet to be seen; and His promise would
have been superfluous unless He had been the Son. For why did He promise to the pure in
heart that they should see the Father, if already they who were then present saw Christ as
the Father? But because He was the Son, not the Father, rightly also He was then seen as the
Son, because He was the image of God; and the Father, because He is invisible, is promised
and pointed out as to be seen by the pure in heart. Let it then be enough to have suggested
even these points against that heretic; a few words about many things. For a field which is
indeed both wide and expansive would be laid open if we should desire to discuss that heretic

<head>Chapter XXIX. Argument.—He Next Teaches Us that the Authority of the Faith
Enjoins, After the Father and the Son, to Believe Also on the Holy Spirit, Whose
Operations He Enumerates from Scripture.</head>
<p>Moreover, the order of reason, and the authority of the faith in the disposition of the
words and in the Scriptures of the Lord, admonish us after these things to believe also on
the Holy Spirit, once promised to the Church, and in the appointed occasions of times given.
For He was promised by Joel the prophet, but given by Christ. “In the last days,” says the
prophet, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and my handmaids.”5257 And the
Lord said, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins ye remit, they shall be remitted; and whose
ye retain, they shall be retained.”5258 But this Holy Spirit the Lord Christ calls at one time
“the Paraclete,” at another pronounces to be the “Spirit of truth.”5259 And He is not new in
the Gospel, nor yet even newly given; for it was He Himself who accused the people in the
prophets, and in the apostles gave them the appeal to the Gentiles. For the former deserved
to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe
deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the
Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times
there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these
offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing
His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the
Apostle Paul says, “Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I
spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.”5260 He is therefore one and the same Spirit
who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the
latter always. But in the former not as being always in them, in the latter as abiding always
in them; and in the former distributed with reserve, in the latter all poured out; in the former
given sparingly, in the latter liberally bestowed; not yet manifested before the Lord’s resurrection,
but conferred after the resurrection. For, said He, “I will pray the Father, and He
will give you another Advocate, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.”5261
And, “When He, the Advocate, shall come, whom I shall send unto you from my Father,
the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from my Father.”5262 And, “If I go not away, that Advocate
shall not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you.”5263 And, “When the Spirit

of truth shall come, He will direct you into all the truth.”5264 And because the Lord was
about to depart to the heavens, He gave the Paraclete out of necessity to the disciples; so as
not to leave them in any degree orphans,5265 which was little desirable, and forsake them
without an advocate and some kind of protector. For this is He who strengthened their
hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener
of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord’s name, neither
dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures,
since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves
the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of
Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers,
directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, offers discrimination of
spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever
other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord’s Church everywhere, and in
all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord
was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed
in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth,
so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire
Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and
works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this,
said: “And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of
counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord
shall fill Him.”5266 This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in
another place, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent
me to preach the Gospel to the poor.”5267 Similarly David: “Wherefore God, even Thy God,
hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”5268 Of Him the Apostle Paul
says: “For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.”5269 “And where the Spirit
of the Lord is, there is liberty.”5270 He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain
seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised
inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us
God’s temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings

that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,—
an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working
in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming
them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine
eternity of the Holy Spirit. For our bodies are both trained in Him and by Him to advance
to immortality, by learning to govern themselves with moderation according to His decrees.
For this is He who “desireth against the flesh,” because “the flesh resisteth against the Spirit.”
5271 This is He who restrains insatiable desires, controls immoderate lusts, quenches
unlawful fires, conquers reckless impulses, repels drunkenness, checks avarice, drives away
luxurious revellings, links love, binds together affections, keeps down sects, orders the rule
of truth, overcomes heretics, turns out the wicked, guards the Gospel. Of this says the same
apostle: “We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God.”5272
Concerning Him he exultingly says: “And I think also that I have the Spirit of God.”5273 Of
Him he says: “The Spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets.”5274 Of Him also he
tells: “Now the Spirit speaketh plainly, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith,
giving heed to seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, who speak lies in hypocrisy, having
their conscience cauterized.”5275 Established in this Spirit, “none ever calleth Jesus anathema;”
5276 no one has ever denied Christ to be the Son of God, or has rejected God the
Creator; no one utters any words of his own contrary to the Scriptures; no one ordains
other and sacrilegious decrees; no one draws up different laws.5277 Whosoever shall blaspheme
against Him, “hath not forgiveness, not only in this world, but also not in the world
to come.”5278 This is He who in the apostles gives testimony to Christ; in the martyrs shows
forth the constant faithfulness of their religion; in virgins restrains the admirable continency
of their sealed chastity; in others, guards the laws of the Lord’s doctrine incorrupt and uncontaminated;
destroys heretics, corrects the perverse, condemns infidels, makes known
pretenders; moreover, rebukes the wicked, keeps the Church uncorrupt and inviolate, in
the sanctity of a perpetual virginity and truth.</p>

<head>Chapter XXX. Argument.—In Fine, Notwithstanding the Said Heretics Have
Gathered the Origin of Their Error from Consideration of What is Written:5279
Although We Call Christ God, and the Father God, Still Scripture Does Not Set
Forth Two Gods, Any More Than Two Lords or Two Teachers.</head>
<p>And now, indeed, concerning the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, let it be sufficient
to have briefly said thus much, and to have laid down these points concisely, without
carrying them out in a lengthened argument. For they could be presented more diffusely
and continued in a more expanded disputation, since the whole of the Old and New Testaments
might be adduced in testimony that thus the true faith stands. But because heretics,
ever struggling against the truth, are accustomed to prolong the controversy of pure tradition
and Catholic faith, being offended against Christ; because He is, moreover, asserted to be
God by the Scriptures also, and this is believed to be so by us; we must rightly—that every
heretical calumny may be removed from our faith—contend, concerning the fact that Christ
is God also, in such a way as that it may not militate against the truth of Scripture; nor yet
against our faith, how there is declared to be one God by the Scriptures, and how it is held
and believed by us. For as well they who say that Jesus Christ Himself is God the Father, as
moreover they who would have Him to be only man, have gathered thence5280 the sources
and reasons of their error and perversity; because when they perceived that it was written5281
that “God is one,” they thought that they could not otherwise hold such an opinion than by
supposing that it must be believed either that Christ was man only, or really God the Father.
And they were accustomed in such a way to connect their sophistries as to endeavour to
justify their own error. And thus they who say that Jesus Christ is the Father argue as follows:—
If God is one, and Christ is God, Christ is the Father, since God is one. If Christ be
not the Father, because Christ is God the Son, there appear to be two Gods introduced,
contrary to the Scriptures. And they who contend that Christ is man only, conclude on the
other hand thus:—If the Father is one, and the Son another, but the Father is God and Christ
is God, then there is not one God, but two Gods are at once introduced, the Father and the
Son; and if God is one, by consequence Christ must be a man, so that rightly the Father may
be one God. Thus indeed the Lord is, as it were, crucified between two thieves,5282 even as

of their perdition and blindness, if they either will not, or cannot, see what is evidently
written in the midst of the divine documents. For we both know, and read, and believe, and
maintain that God is one, who made the heaven as well as the earth, since we neither know
any other, nor shall we at any time know such, seeing that there is none. “I,” says He, “am
God, and there is none beside me, righteous and a Saviour.”5283 And in another place: “I
am the first and the last, and beside me there is no God who is as I.”5284 And, “Who hath
meted out heaven with a span, and the earth with a handful? Who has suspended the
mountains in a balance, and the woods on scales?”5285 And Hezekiah: “That all may know
that Thou art God alone.”5286 Moreover, the Lord Himself: “Why askest thou me concerning
that which is good? God alone is good.”5287 Moreover, the Apostle Paul says: “Who only
hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light that no man can approach unto, whom no man
hath seen, nor can see.”5288 And in another place: “But a mediator is not a mediator of one,
but God is one.”5289 But even as we hold, and read, and believe this, thus we ought to pass
over no portion of the heavenly Scriptures, since indeed also we ought by no means to reject
those marks of Christ’s divinity which are laid down in the Scriptures, that we may not, by
corrupting the authority of the Scriptures, be held to have corrupted the integrity of our
holy faith. And let us therefore believe this, since it is most faithful that Jesus Christ the Son
of God is our Lord and God; because “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God.”5290 And,
“The Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us.”5291 And, “My Lord and my God.”5292 And,
“Whose are the fathers, and of whom according to the flesh Christ came, who is over all,
God blessed for evermore.”5293 What, then, shall we say? Does Scripture set before us two
Gods? How, then, does it say that “God is one?” Or is not Christ God also? How, then, is
it said to Christ, “My Lord and my God?” Unless, therefore, we hold all this with fitting
veneration and lawful argument, we shall reasonably be thought to have furnished a scandal
to the heretics, not assuredly by the fault of the heavenly Scriptures, which never deceive;

but by the presumption of human error, whereby they have chosen to be heretics. And in
the first place, we must turn the attack against them who undertake to make against us the
charge of saying that there are two Gods. It is written, and they cannot deny it, that “there
is one Lord.”5294 What, then, do they think of Christ?—that He is Lord, or that He is not
Lord at all? But they do not doubt absolutely that He is Lord; therefore, if their reasoning
be true, here are already two Lords. How, then, is it true according to the Scriptures, there
is one Lord? And Christ is called the “one Master.”5295 Nevertheless we read that the Apostle
Paul also is a master.5296 Then, according to this, our Master is not one, for from these
things we conclude that there are two masters. How, then, according to the Scriptures, is
“one our Master, even Christ?” In the Scriptures there is one “called good, even God;” but
in the same Scriptures Christ is also asserted to be good. There is not, then, if they rightly
conclude, one good, but even two good. How, then, according to the scriptural faith, is there
said to be only one good? But if they do not think that it can by any means interfere with
the truth that there is one Lord, that Christ also is Lord, nor with the truth that one is our
Master, that Paul also is our master, or with the truth that one is good, that Christ also is
called good; on the same reasoning, let them understand that, from the fact that God is one,
no obstruction arises to the truth that Christ also is declared to be God.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI. Argument.—But that God, the Son of God, Born of God the Father
from Everlasting, Who Was Always in the Father, is the Second Person to the
Father, Who Does Nothing Without His Father’s Decree; And that He is Lord,
and the Angel of God’s Great Counsel, to Whom the Father’s Godhead is Given
by Community of Substance.</head>
<p>Thus God the Father, the Founder and Creator of all things, who only knows no beginning,
invisible, infinite, immortal, eternal, is one God; to whose greatness, or majesty, or
power, I would not say nothing can be preferred, but nothing can be compared; of whom,
when He willed it, the Son, the Word, was born, who is not received5297 in the sound of the
stricken air, or in the tone of voice forced from the lungs, but is acknowledged in the substance
of the power put forth by God, the mysteries of whose sacred and divine nativity
neither an apostle has learnt, nor prophet has discovered, nor angel has known, nor creature
has apprehended. To the Son alone they are known, who has known the secrets of the
Father. He then, since He was begotten of the Father, is always in the Father. And I thus say
always, that I may show Him not to be unborn, but born. But He who is before all time must
be said to have been always in the Father; for no time can be assigned to Him who is before
all time. And He is always in the Father, unless the Father be not always Father, only that
the Father also precedes Him,—in a certain sense,—since it is necessary—in some degree—
that He should be before He is Father. Because it is essential that He who knows no
beginning must go before Him who has a beginning;5298 even as He is the less as knowing
that He is in Him, having an origin because He is born, and of like nature with the Father
in some measure by His nativity, although He has a beginning in that He is born, inasmuch
as He is born of that Father who alone has no beginning. He, then, when the Father willed
it, proceeded from the Father, and He who was in the Father came forth from the Father;
and He who was in the Father because He was of the Father, was subsequently with the
Father, because He came forth from the Father,—that is to say, that divine substance whose
name is the Word, whereby all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.
For all things are after Him, because they are by Him. And reasonably, He is before all things,
but after the Father, since all things were made by Him, and He proceeded from Him of
whose will all things were made. Assuredly God proceeding from God, causing a person
second to the Father as being the Son, but not taking from the Father that characteristic that
He is one God. For if He had not been born—compared with Him who was unborn, an
equality being manifested in both—He would make two unborn beings, and thus would
make two Gods. If He had not been begotten—compared with Him who was not begotten,
<note type="footnote">5297 As the Word formed. [He expounds Ps. xliv. (xlv.), Sept.]</note>
<note type="footnote">5298 [“In a sense;” i.e., in logic, not time.]</note>

<pb n="1532"/>
and as being found equal—they not being begotten, would have reasonably given two Gods,
and thus Christ would have been the cause of two Gods. Had He been formed without beginning
as the Father, and He Himself the beginning of all things as is the Father, this would
have made two beginnings, and consequently would have shown to us two Gods also. Or if
He also were not the Son, but the Father begetting from Himself another Son, reasonably,
as compared with the Father, and designated as great as He, He would have caused two
Fathers, and thus also He would have proved the existence of two Gods. Had He been invisible,
as compared with the Invisible, and declared equal, He would have shown forth two
Invisibles, and thus also He would have proved them to be two Gods. If incomprehensible,5299
if also whatever other attributes belong to the Father, reasonably we say, He would have
given rise to the allegation of two Gods, as these people feign. But now, whatever He is, He
is not of Himself, because He is not unborn; but He is of the Father, because He is begotten,
whether as being the Word, whether as being the Power, or as being the Wisdom, or as being
the Light, or as being the Son; and whatever of these He is, in that He is not from any other
source, as we have already said before, than from the Father, owing His origin to His Father,
He could not make a disagreement in the divinity by the number of two Gods, since He
gathered His beginning by being born of Him who is one God. In which kind, being both
as well only-begotten as first-begotten of Him who has no beginning, He is the only one, of
all things both Source and Head. And therefore He declared that God is one, in that He
proved Him to be from no source nor beginning, but rather the beginning and source of all
things. Moreover, the Son does nothing of His own will, nor does anything of His own determination;
nor does He come from Himself, but obeys all His Father’s commands and
precepts; so that, although birth proves Him to be a Son, yet obedience even to death declares
Him the minister of the will of His Father, of whom He is. Thus making Himself obedient
to His Father in all things, although He also is God, yet He shows the one God the Father
by His obedience, from whom also He drew His beginning. And thus He could not make
two Gods, because He did not make two beginnings, seeing that from Him who has no beginning
He received the source of His nativity before all time.5300 For since that is the beginning
to other creatures which is unborn,—which God the Father only is, being beyond
a beginning of whom He is who was born,—while He who is born of Him reasonably comes
from Him who has no beginning, proving that to be the beginning from which He Himself
is, even although He is God who is born, yet He shows Him to be one God whom He who
was born proved to be without a beginning. He therefore is God, but begotten for this special
result, that He should be God. He is also the Lord, but born for this very purpose of the
Father, that He might be Lord. He is also an Angel, but He was destined of the Father as an

<note type="footnote">5300 [As in the Athanasian Confession.]</note>

<pb n="1533"/>
Angel to announce the Great Counsel of God. And His divinity is thus declared, that it may
not appear by any dissonance or inequality of divinity to have caused two Gods. For all
things being subjected to Him as the Son by the Father, while He Himself, with those things
which are subjected to Him, is subjected to His Father, He is indeed proved to be Son of
His Father; but He is found to be both Lord and God of all else. Whence, while all things
put under Him are delivered to Him who is God, and all things are subjected to Him, the
Son refers all that He has received to the Father, remits again to the Father the whole authority
of His divinity. The true and eternal Father is manifested as the one God, from whom alone
this power of divinity is sent forth, and also given and directed upon the Son, and is again
returned by the communion of substance to the Father. God indeed is shown as the Son, to
whom the divinity is beheld to be given and extended. And still, nevertheless, the Father is
proved to be one God; while by degrees in reciprocal transfer that majesty and divinity are
again returned and reflected as sent by the Son Himself to the Father, who had given them;
so that reasonably God the Father is God of all, and the source also of His Son Himself
whom He begot as Lord. Moreover, the Son is God of all else, because God the Father put
before all Him whom He begot. Thus the Mediator of God and men, Christ Jesus, having
the power of every creature subjected to Him by His own Father, inasmuch as He is God;
with every creature subdued to Him, found at one with His Father God, has, by abiding in
that condition that He moreover “was heard,”5301 briefly proved God His Father to be one
and only and true God.</p>

Brethren, Had Written Two Earlier Epistles Against the Jews on the Subjects of
Circumcision and the Sabbath, and Now Writes the Present One on the Jewish
Meats.</head>
<p>Although, most holy brethren, the day in which I receive your letters and writings is
most ardently longed for by me, and to be reckoned among the chief and happiest—for
what else is there now to make me more joyous?5303—still I think that the day is to be
deemed not less notable, and among special days, wherein I return to you similar communications,
with the affection of love that I owe you, and write you letters with a corresponding
interest. For nothing, most holy brethren, holds me bound with such bonds, nothing stirs
and arouses me with such a stimulus of care and anxiety, as the fear lest you should think
that any disadvantage is suffered by you by reason of my absence; and this I strive to remedy,
in labouring to show myself present with you by frequent letters. Although, therefore, the
duty which I owe, and the charge I have undertaken, and the very ministerial office imposed
upon me, require of me this necessity of writing letters, yet you still further enhance it, by
stirring me up to write through means of your continual communications. And inclined
although I am to those periodical expressions of love, you urge me the more by showing
that you stand fast continually in the Gospel: whence it results, that by my letters I am not
so much instructing you who are already informed, as inciting you who are already prepared.
For you, who not only hold the Gospel pure and purged from all stain of perverse doctrine,
but also energetically teach the same, seek not man for a master, since you show yourselves
by these very things to be teachers. Therefore as you run, I exhort you; and as you watch, I
stir you up; and as you contend against “the spiritual things of wickedness,”5304 I address
you; and as you press “in your course to the prize of your calling in Christ,”5305 I urge you
on,—that, treading under foot and rejecting as well the sacrilegious calumnies of heretics
as also the idle fables of Jews, you may hold the sole word5306 and teaching of Christ, so as
worthily to claim for yourselves the authority of His name. But how perverse are the Jews,

and remote from the understanding of their law, I have fully shown, as I believe, in two

<head>Chapter II. Argument.—He First of All Asserts that the Law is Spiritual; And Thence,
Man’s First Food Was Only the Fruit Trees, and the Use of Flesh Was Added,
that the Law that Followed Subsequently5309 Was to Be Understood Spiritually.</head>
<p>Therefore, first of all, we must avail ourselves of that passage, “that the law is spiritual;”
5311 and if they deny it to be spiritual, they assuredly blaspheme; if, avoiding blasphemy,
they confess it to be spiritual, let them read it spiritually. For divine things must be divinely
received, and must assuredly be maintained as holy. But a grave fault is branded on those
who attach earthly and human doctrine to sacred and spiritual words; and this we must
beware of doing. Moreover, we may beware, if any things enjoined by God be so treated as
if they were assumed to diminish His authority, lest, in calling some things impure and
unclean, their institution should dishonour their ordainer. For in reprobating what He has
made, He will appear to have condemned His own works, which He had approved as good;
and He will be designated as seeming capricious in both cases, as the heretics indeed would
have it; either in having blessed things which were not clean, or in subsequently reprobating
as not good, creatures which He had blessed as both clean and good. And of this the
enormity and contradiction will remain for ever if that Jewish doctrine is persisted in, which
must be got rid of with all our ability; so that whatever is irregularly delivered by them, may
be taken away by us, and a suitable arrangement of His works, and an appropriate and
spiritual application of the divine law, may be restored. But to begin from the beginning of
things, whence it behoves me to begin; the only food for the first men was fruit and the
produce of the trees. For afterwards, man’s sin transferred his need from the fruit-trees to
the produce of the earth, when the very attitude of his body attested the condition of his
conscience. For although innocency raised men up towards the heavens to pluck their food
from the trees so long as they had a good conscience, yet sin, when committed, bent men
down to the earth and to the ground to gather its grain. Moreover, afterwards the use of
flesh was added, the divine favour supplying for human necessities the kinds of meats generally
fitting for suitable occasions. For while a more tender meat was needed to nourish
men who were both tender and unskilled, it was still a food not prepared without toil,
<note type="footnote">5309 Which, distinguishing between meats, granted certain animals as clean, and interdicted certain others
as not clean, especially as all animals were declared “very good,” and even unclean animals were reserved for
offspring in Noah’s ark, although they otherwise might have been got rid of, if they ought to have been destroyed
on account of their uncleanness.</note>
<note type="footnote">5310 [The divers animals are also parables illustrating human passions and appetites. See Jones of Nayland,

<pb n="1538"/>
doubtless for their advantage, lest they should again find a pleasure in sinning, if the labour
imposed upon sin did not exhort innocence. And since now it was no more a paradise to
be tended, but a whole world to be cultivated, the more robust food of flesh is offered to
men, that for the advantage of culture something more might be added to the vigour of the
human body. All these things, as I have said, were by grace and by divine arrangement: so
that either the most vigorous food should not be given in too small quantity for men’s support,
and they should be enfeebled for labour; or that the more tender meat should not be
too abundant, so that, oppressed beyond the measure of their strength, they should not be
able to bear it.5312 But the law which followed subsequently ordained5313 the flesh foods
with distinction: for some animals it gave and granted for use,5314 as being clean; some it
interdicted as not clean, and conveying pollution to those that eat them. Moreover, it gave
this character to those that were clean, that those which chew the cud and divide the hoofs
are clean; those are unclean which do neither one nor other of these things. So, in fishes
also, the law said that those indeed were clean which were covered with scales and supplied
with fins, but that those which were otherwise were not clean. Moreover, it established a
distinction among the fowls, and laid down what was to be judged either an abomination,
or clean. Thus the law ordained the exercise of very great subtlety in making a separation
among those animals which the ancient appointment had gathered together into one form
of blessing. What, then, are we to say? Are the animals therefore unclean? But what else is
it to say that they are not clean, than that the law has separated them from the uses of food?
And what, moreover, is that that we have just now said? Then God is the ordainer of things
which are not clean; and the blame attached to things which are made will recoil upon their
Maker, who did not produce them clean; to say which is certainly characteristic of extreme
and excessive folly: it is to accuse God as having created unclean things, and to charge upon
the divine majesty the guilt of having made things which are abomination, especially when
they were both pronounced “very good,”5315 and as being good have obtained the blessing
from God Himself “that they should increase and multiply.” Moreover also they were reserved
by the command of the Creator in Noah’s ark for the sake of their offspring, that so being
kept they might be proved to be needful; and being needful, they might be proved to be
good, although even in that case also there is a distinction appended. But still, even then,

<head>Chapter III. Argument.—And Thus Unclean Animals are Not to Be Reproached,
Lest the Reproach Be Thrown Upon Their Author; But When an Irrational Animal
is Rejected on Any Account, It is Rather that that Very Thing Should Be
Condemned in Man Who is Rational; And Therefore that in Animals the Character,
the Doings, and the Wills of Men are Depicted.</head>
<p>How far, then, must that law, which—as I have shown by the authority of the apostle—is
spiritual, be spiritually received in order that the divine and sure idea of the law may be
carried out? Firstly, we must believe that whatever was ordained by God is clean and purified
by the very authority of His creation; neither must it be reproached, lest the reproach should
be thrown back upon its Author. Then too that the law was given to the children of Israel
for this purpose, that they might profit by it, and return to those virtuous manners which,
although they had received them from their fathers, they had corrupted in Egypt by reason
of their intercourse with a barbarous people. Finally, also, those ten commandments on the
tables teach nothing new, but remind them of what had been obliterated—that righteousness
in them, which had been put to sleep, might revive again as it were by the afflatus of the law,
after the manner of a smothered fire. But they could profit by the perception that those vices
were especially to be avoided in men which the law had condemned even in beasts.5316 For
when an irrational animal is rejected on any account, it is rather that very thing which is
condemned in the man, who is rational. And if in it anything which it has by nature is
characterized as a defilement, that same thing is most to be blamed when it is found in man
opposed to his nature. Therefore, in order that men might be purified, the cattle were censured—
to wit, that men also who had the same vices might be esteemed on a level with the
brutes. Whence it results, that not only were the animals not condemned by their Creator
because of His agency;5317 but that men might be instructed in the brutes to return to the
unspotted nature of their own creation. For we must consider how the Lord distinguishes
clean and not clean. The creatures that are clean, it says, both chew the cud and divide the
hoof; the unclean do neither, or only one of the two. All these things were made by one
Workman, and He who made them Himself blessed them. Therefore I regard the creation
of both as clean, because both He who created them is holy, and those things which were
created are not in fault in being that which they were made. For it has never been customary
for nature, but for a perverted will, to bear the blame of guilt. What, then, is the case? In
the animals it is the characters, and doings, and wills of men that are depicted.5318 They are
<note type="footnote">5316 [See chap. ii. p. 645, supra, note 9.]</note>

<note type="footnote">5318 [The moral uses of the animal creation are recognised in all languages; as when we say of men, a serpent,

<pb n="1541"/>
clean if they chew the cud; that is, if they ever have in their mouth as food the divine precepts.
They divide the hoof, if with the firm step of innocency they tread the ways of righteousness,
and of every virtue of life. For of those creatures which divide the foot into two hoofs the
walk is always vigorous; the tendency to slip of one part of the hoof being sustained by the
firmness of the other, and so retained in the substantial footstep. Thus they who do neither
are unclean, whose walk is neither firm in virtues; nor do they digest the food of the divine
precepts after the manner of that chewing of the cud. And they, too, who do one of these
things are not themselves clean either, inasmuch as they are maimed of the other, and not
perfect in both. And these are they who do both, as believers, and are clean; or one of the
two, as Jews and heretics, and are blemished; or neither, as the Gentiles, and are consequently
unclean. Thus in the animals, by the law, as it were, a certain mirror of human life is established,
wherein men may consider the images of penalties; so that everything which is vicious
in men, as committed against nature, may be the more condemned, when even those things,
although naturally ordained in brutes, are in them blamed.5319 For that in fishes the
roughness of scales is regarded as constituting their cleanness; rough, and rugged, and unpolished,
and substantial, and grave manners are approved in men; while those that are
without scales are unclean; because trifling, and fickle, and faithless, and effeminate manners
are disapproved. Moreover, what does the law mean when it says, “Thou shalt not eat the
camel?”5320—except that by the example of that animal it condemns a life nerveless5321 and
crooked with crimes. Or when it forbids the swine to be taken for food? It assuredly reproves
a life filthy and dirty, and delighting in the garbage of vice, placing its supreme good not in
generosity of mind, but in the flesh alone. Or when it forbids the hare? It rebukes men deformed
into women. And who would use the body of the weasel for food? But in this case
it reproves theft. Who would eat the lizard? But it hates an aimless waywardness of life. Who
the eft? But it execrates mental stains. Who would eat the hawk, who the kite, who the eagle?
But it hates plunderers and violent people who live by crime. Who the vulture? But it holds
accursed those who seek for booty by the death of others. Or who the raven? But it holds
accused crafty wills. Moreover, when it forbids the sparrow, it condemns intemperance;
when the owl, it hates those who fly from the light of truth; when the swan, the proud with
high neck; when the sea-mew, too talkative an intemperance of tongue; when the bat, those
who seek the darkness of night as well as of error. These things, then, and the like to these,
the law holds accursed in animals, which in them indeed are not blameworthy, because they

<head>Chapter IV. Argument.—To These Things Also Was Added Another Reason for
Prohibiting Many Kinds of Meats to the Jews; To Wit, for the Restraint of the
Intemperance of the People, and that They Might Serve the One God.</head>
<p>To these considerations, then, thus enumerated, were added also other reasons for which
many kinds of meats were withheld from the Jews; and that this might be so, many things
were called unclean, not as being condemned in themselves, but that the Jews might be restrained
to the service of one God; because frugality and moderation in appetite were becoming
to those who were chosen for this purpose. And such moderation is always found
to be approximate to religion, nay, so to speak, rather related and akin to it; for luxury is
inimical to holiness. For how shall religion be spared by it, when modesty is not spared?
Luxury does not entertain the fear of God; since while pleasures hurry it on, it is carried
forward to the sole daring of its desires: for the reins being loosened, it increases in the application
of expense without measure, as if it were its food, exceeding its patrimony with its
modesty; or as a torrent rushing from the mountain-peaks not only overleaps what is opposed
to it, but carries with it those very hindrances for the destruction of other things. Therefore
these remedies were sought for to restrain the intemperance of the people, that in proportion
as luxury was diminished, virtuous manners might be increased. For what else did they deserve,
than that they should be restrained from using all the pictures of divers meats, who
dared to prefer the vilest meats of the Egyptians to the divine banquets of manna, preferring
the juicy meats of their enemies and masters to their liberty? They were truly worthy that
the slavery which they had coveted should pamper them, if the food that was more desirable
and free was so ill pleasing to them.</p>

<head>Chapter V. Argument.—But There Was a Limit to the Use of These Shadows or
Figures; For Afterwards, When the End of the Law, Christ, Came, All Things
Were Said by the Apostle to Be Pure to the Pure, and the True and Holy Meat
Was a Right Faith and an Unspotted Conscience.</head>
<p>And thus there was a certain ancient time, wherein those shadows or figures were to be
used, that meats should be abstained from which had indeed been commended by their
creation, but had been prohibited by the law. But now Christ, the end of the law, has come,
disclosing all the obscurities of the law—all those things which antiquity had covered with
the clouds of sacraments. For the illustrious Master, and the heavenly Teacher, and the ordainer
of the perfected truth, has come, under whom at length it is rightly said: “To the pure
all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even
their mind and conscience is defiled.”5322 Moreover, in another place: “For every creature
of God is good, and nothing to be refused which is received with thanksgiving; for it is
sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.”5323 Again, in another place: “The Spirit expressly
says that in the last days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits,
doctrines of demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot
iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created
to be received with thanksgiving by them which believe and those who know God.”5324
Moreover, in another passage: “Everything that is sold in the market-place eat, asking
nothing.”5325 From these things it is plain that all those things are returned to their original
blessedness now that the law is finished, and that we must not revert to the special observances
of meats, which observances were ordained for a certain reason, but which evangelical
liberty has now taken away, their discharge being given. The apostle cries out: “The kingdom
of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy.”5326 Also elsewhere:
“Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now
the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.”5327 God is not
worshipped by the belly nor by meats, which the Lord says will perish, and are “purged” by
natural law in the draught.5328 For he who worships the Lord by meats, is merely as one

who has his belly for his Lord. The meat, I say, true, and holy, and pure, is a true faith, an
unspotted conscience, and an innocent soul. Whosoever is thus fed, feeds also with Christ.
Such a banqueter is God’s guest: these are the feasts that feed the angels, these are the tables
which the martyrs make. Hence is that word of the law: “Man doth not live by bread alone,
but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”5329 Hence, too, that saying
of Christ: “My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.”5330 Hence,
“Ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of my loaves and were
filled. But labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which endureth to life
eternal, which the Son of man will give you; for Him hath the Father sealed.”5331 By righteousness,
I say, and by continency, and by the rest of the virtues, God is worshipped. For
Zecharias also tells us, saying: “If ye eat or drink, is it not ye that eat or drink?”5332—declaring
thereby that meat or drink attain not unto God, but unto man: for neither is God fleshly,
so as to be pleased with flesh; nor is He careful5333 for these pleasures, so as to rejoice in
our food.5334 God rejoices in our faith alone, in our innocency alone, in our truth alone, in
our virtues alone. And these dwell not in our belly, but in our soul; and these are acquired
for us by divine awe and heavenly fear, and not by earthly food. And such the apostle fitly
rebuked, as “obeying the superstitions of angels, puffed up by their fleshly mind; not holding
Christ the head, from whom all the body, joined together by links, and inwoven and grown
together by mutual members in the bond of charity, increaseth to God;”5335 but observing
those things: “Touch not, taste not, handle not; which indeed seem to have a form of religion,
in that the body is not spared.”5336 Yet there is no advantage at all of righteousness, while
we are recalled by a voluntary slavery to those elements to which by baptism we have died.</p>

<head>Chapter VI. Argument.—But, on the Ground that Liberty in Meats is Granted to
Us, There is No Permission of Luxury, There is No Taking Away of Continence
and Fasting: for These Things Greatly Become the Faithful,—To Wit, that They
Should Pray to God, and Give Him Thanks, Not Only by Day, But by Night.</head>
<p>But from the fact that liberty of meats is granted to us, it does not of necessity follow
that luxury is allowed us; nor because the Gospel has dealt with us very liberally, has it taken
away continency. By this, I say, the belly is not provided for, but the form of meats was
shown: it was made manifest what was right, not that we might go into the gulf of desire,
but to give a reason for the law. But nothing has so restrained intemperance as the Gospel;
nor has any one given such strict laws against gluttony as Christ, who is said to have pronounced
even the poor blessed, and the hungering and thirsting happy, the rich miserable;
to whom, obeying the government of their belly and their palate, the material of their lusts
could never be wanting, so that their servitude could not cease; who think it an argument
of their happiness to desire as much as they can, except that they are thus able to attain less
than they desire. For, moreover, preferring Lazarus in his very hunger and in his sores
themselves, and with the rich man’s dogs, He restrained the destroyers of salvation, the belly
and the palate, by examples. The apostle also, when he said, “Having food and raiment, we
are therewith content,”5337 laid down the law of frugality and continency; and thinking that
it would be of little advantage that he had written, he also gave himself as an example of
what he had written, adding not without reason, that “avarice is the root of all evils;”5338
for it follows in the footsteps of luxury. Whatever the latter has wasted by vice, the former
restores by crime; the circle of crimes being re-trodden, that luxury may again take away
whatever avarice had heaped together. Nor yet are there wanting, among such things, those
who, although they have claimed to themselves the sound of the Christian name, afford instances
and teachings of intemperance; whose vices have come even to that pitch, that while
fasting they drink in the early morning, not thinking it Christian to drink after meat, unless
the wine poured into their empty and unoccupied veins should have gone down directly
after sleep: for they seem to have less relish of what they drink if food be mingled with the
wine. Thus you may see such in a new kind, still fasting and already drunk, not running to
the tavern, but carrying the tavern about with them; and if any one of them offers a salute,
he gives not a kiss, but drinks a health. What can they do after meat, whom meat finds intoxicated?
Or in what kind of state does the sun at his setting leave them, whom at his rising
he looks upon as already stupid with wine? But things which are detestable are not to be
taken as our examples. For those things only are to be taken by which our soul may be made

better; and although in the Gospel the use of meats is universally given to us, yet it is understood
to be given to us only with the law of frugality and continence. For these things are
even greatly becoming to the faithful,—to wit, those who are about to pray to God and to
give Him thanks, not only by day, but by night also; which cannot be if the mind, stupefied
by meat and wine, should not prevail to shake off heavy sleep and the load heaped upon the
breast.</p>

<p>But it must be very greatly guarded against in the use of food, and we must be warned
lest any should think that liberty is permitted to that degree that even he may approach to
what has been offered to idols. For, as far as pertains to God’s creation, every creature is
clean. But when it has been offered to demons, it is polluted so long as it is offered to the
idols; and as soon as this is done, it belongs no longer to God, but to the idol. And when
this creature is taken for food, it nourishes the person who so takes it for the demon, not
for God, by making him a fellow-guest with the idol, not with Christ, as rightly do the Jews
also.5339 And the meaning of these meats being perceived, and the counsel of the law being
considered, and the kindness of the Gospel grace being known, and the rigour of temperance
being observed, and the pollution of things offered to idols being rejected, we who keep the
rule of truth throughout all things, ought to give thanks to God through Jesus Christ, His
Son, our Lord, to whom be praise, and honour, and glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Introductory Notice5342
to an
Anonymous Treatise Against the Heretic Novatian.</head>
<p>The writer of the following treatise was undoubtedly a contemporary of Cyprian, and
wrote in the early part of the reign of Valerian (254–256), during an interval of peace to the
Church. This much may be collected from the fact that he names one, and only one, persecution
after that of Decius—namely, that of Gallus and Volusianus—and speaks of those
who had lapsed under the former, as having been stedfast and victorious in the latter.5343
He is generally believed to have been an African, and Tillemont is only withheld from attributing
the work to Cyprian himself by what he judges to be a difference of style. But although
from the exordium it may be concluded that the writer was a bishop, yet, from his manifest
uncertainty as to the fitting way to treat those who had lapsed, it is evident that Cyprian
cannot have been the author; for that prelate, when the persecution of Gallus and Volusianus
was just threatening, had already decided upon receiving to communion the penitents who
had yielded to temptation under Decius.5344</p>
<p>Ceillier5345 says that this treatise was written about the year 255, while Novatian was
still alive,5346 and when the schism of Felicissimus was all but extinct.</p>
<p>Erasmus first published it among the known works of Cyprian in the year 1520.</p>
</div>

<div type="commentary" subtype="other">
<head>Note.</head>
<p>The American editor subjoins as follows: Cyprian, and Cornelius afterward, had decided,
with their councils, that the lapsed should be classed, and dealt with accordingly, as (1) Libellatici,
those who had compounded with the heathen, and bought off from offering sacrifice;
and (2) Sacrificati, those who had actually offered sacrifice to idols. Different degrees of
discipline were awarded, but all were admitted to pardon finally.</p>

<head>A Treatise Against the Heretic Novatian by an Anonymous
Bishop.</head>
<p>That the Hope of Pardon Should Not Be Denied to the Lapsed.</p>
<p>1. While I was meditating and impatiently tossing in my mind what I ought to do concerning
those pitiable brethren who, wounded, not of their own will, but by the onset of a
raging devil, have lived until now, that is, through a long course of time, in the endurance
of their punishment; lo, there appeared opposed to me another enemy, and the adversary
of his own paternal affection—the heretic Novatian—who not only, as it is signified in the
Gospel, passed by the prostrate wounded man, as did the priest or the Levite, but by an ingenious
and novel cruelty rather would slay the wounded man, by taking away the hope of
salvation, by denying the mercy of his Father, by rejecting the repentance of his brother.
Marvellous, how bitter, how harsh, how perverse are many things! But one more easily
perceives the straw in another’s eye than the beam in one’s own. Let not the abrupt madness
of that perfidious heretic move or disturb us however, beloved brethren, who, although he
is placed in such great guilt of dissension and schism, and is separated from the Church,
with sacrilegious temerity does not shrink from hurling back his charges upon us: for although
he is now by himself made unclean, defiled with the filth of sacrilege, he contends
that we are so. And although it is written that the dogs should remain without, and the
apostle has taught that these same dogs must be shunned, as we read, for he says, “Beware
of dogs, beware of evil workers,”5347 he does not cease stirring up his frenzy with barkings,
after the manner of wolves seeking the gloomy darkness, where with his brutal cruelty he
may easily rend in his dark caves the sheep snatched away from the Shepherd. Certainly he
declares that he and his friends whom he collects are gold. Nor do we doubt but that
deserters of the Church who have become apostates could now easily be converted into
gold, but it must be that gold in which the first sins of the people of Israel were designated.
But the gold and silver vessels which were wrested from the Egyptians continue in the Lord’s
power, that is, in Christ’s Church; in which house if thou hadst continued, Novatian, thou
hadst perchance been also a precious vessel; but now thou neither perceivest nor complainest
that thou art changed into chaff and straw.</p>
<p>2. Why, therefore, shouldst thou be lifted up with vain things? Thou wilt gain loss rather
than profit. Why, from the very fact that thou art become poorer, believest thou thyself rich?
Hear in the Apocalypse the Lord’s voice rebuking thee with righteous reproaches: “Thou
sayest,” says He, “I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and
<note type="footnote">5347 Phil. iii. 2.</note>

<pb n="1554"/>
knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and blind, and poor, and naked.”5348
Let him think for certain that he possesses these riches of poverty, whoever he may be, that,
forsaking the Church of Christ, with his darkened reason does not shrink from being turned
to those rash leaders of schisms and authors of dissension, whom John calls antichrists,
whom the Evangelist likens to chaff, whom the Lord Christ characterizes as thieves and
robbers, as He Himself declares in the Gospel, saying that “he who entereth not by the door
into the sheep-fold, but goeth down by some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.”5349
Moreover, in the same He also says, “All who have come are thieves and robbers.”5350 Who
are such but the deserters of the faith, and the transgressors of God’s Church, who strive
against God’s ordinance; whom the Holy Spirit rightly rebukes by the prophet, saying, “Ye
have taken counsel, but not by me; and have made a confederacy, but not by my Spirit, to
add sin to sin.”5351 What now can those most perverse friends of Novatian, even now the
most unhappy5352 few, reply to these things, who have broken forth to such a folly of madness
as to have no reverence either for God or man? Among them, shamelessly, and without any
law of ordination, the episcopate is sought after; but among us in its own Sees, and in those
of the throne delivered to it by God, it is renounced.5353 There the Truth says, “They reject
me, that they may sacrifice to me; nor do they offer the holy oblations of the children of Israel,
nor do they approach to offer the holy of holies, but they shall receive their ignominy in the
error wherein they have erred.”5354 Let it be enough in a few words to have proved what
they are. Hear, therefore, O Novatians, among whom the heavenly Scriptures are read rather
than understood; well, if they are not interpolated.5355 For your ears are closed, and your
hearts darkened, seeing that ye admit no light from spiritual and saving warnings; as Isaiah
says, “The servants of God are blinded.”5356 And deservedly blinded, because the desire of
schismatics is not in the law; which law points out to us the one and only Church in that
ark to wit, which was fashioned, by the providence of God, under Noah before the deluge,
in which—to answer you quickly, O Novatian—we find that there were shut up not only
clean animals, but also unclean; which ark was saved alone, with those who were in it,

whereas the other things which were not found therein perished in the deluge. From that
ark there were loosed two birds, a raven and a dove; and this raven truly bore the figure or
type of impure men, and men who would be in perpetual darkness through the world’s
broad road, and of apostates who should arise, feeding on unclean things, and not turning
themselves eventually to the Church; and as we read, we find that it was sent forth, and returned
no more. Whoever should be found to resemble this bird, then, that is, the impure
spirit, will no more be able to return to the Church, seeing that the Lord will forbid them,
even if they should wish it, as He commanded Moses, saying, “Everything leprous5357 and
impure, cast abroad outside the camp.”5358 But the dove sent forth that returned, is signified
by the man who does not delay, because he would have no rest for his feet. And Noah received
it into the ark; and when it was sent forth again on the seventh day, received it, bearing in
its mouth an olive leaf.</p>
<p>3. And I, beloved brethren,—as I not heedlessly meditate these things, and not in harmony
with human wisdom, but as it is permitted to our minds by the condescension of the
heavenly Lord, needfully and pertinently to conceive,—say that that dove signifies to us of
itself a double type. Formerly, that is, from the beginning of the divine administration, it
suggests its own figure, the first indeed and chief—that is, the figure of the Spirit. And by
its mouth the sacrament of baptism which is provided for the salvation of the human race,
and that by the heavenly plan it is celebrated in the Church only.5359 Moreover, three times
sent forth from the ark, flying about through the air over the water, it already signified the
sacraments of our Church. Whence also the Lord Christ charges upon Peter, and moreover
also upon the rest of His disciples, “Go ye and preach the Gospel to the nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”5360 That is, that
that same Trinity which operated figuratively in Noah’s days through the dove, now operates
in the Church spiritually through the disciples.</p>
<p>4. Let us now take the second character also of the dove sent forth from the ark, that is
to say, in the time of the deluge, when all the abysses broke forth; when the cataracts of
heaven were opened upon the earth, on account of the wickedness of men which they daily
practised before the Lord; as said Moses, “And the Lord God saw that the wickednesses of
men were overflowing upon the earth, and that all of them were remembering for evil from
the beginning of their days; and He said, I will destroy man whom I have made from off the
face of the earth, from man even unto cattle, and from the creeping thing even unto the

when the waters were violently rushing with all their force upon the earth.</p>
<p>5. That ark bore the figure of the Church, as we have said above, which was stricken
hither and thither to such a degree by the tumultuous waters. Therefore that deluge which
happened under Noah showed forth the figure of the persecution which now lately was
poured forth over the whole world. Moreover, by the waters, the cataracts broken forth
meeting together on all sides, and growing, were signified the peoples which grew up for
the desolation of the Church; as the Apocalypse teaches, saying, “The waters which thou
sawest are peoples, and nations, and kingdoms.”5362 Moreover, the dove which could not
find rest for its feet, bore the likeness of the lapsed, who fell forgetful of the divine announcements,
either ignorant in simplicity, or feigning in audacity. Of whom the Lord had intimated
the future destruction in the Gospel in these words, saying, “He who heareth my words and
doeth them not, I will liken him to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand: the
tempests came and beat upon that house, and it fell; and great was its destruction.”5363 And
lest we should seem to have made the comparison inconsiderately of that dove bearing the
image of the lapsed, the prophet rebukes the city as a dove, that is, the character of the lapsed,
saying, “The dove hearkens not to the voice; that is, the illustrious and redeemed city receives
not teaching, and trusted not in the Lord.”5364</p>
<p>6. Moreover, that that dove could not find rest for her feet, as we have said above, this
signified the footsteps of those who deny; that is, those, wounded by the poison of the
shining serpent, who sacrifice, turned towards their fall; which could not any further step
upon the asp and the basilisk, and tread upon the dragon and the lion. For this power the
Lord gave to His disciples, as He says in the Gospel: “Lo, I give unto you power to tread on
all the power of the enemy, and upon serpents and scorpions; and they shall not harm
you.”5365 When, therefore, these so many and such malignant spirits are attacking and bestirring
themselves for the destruction of the lapsed, a way of salvation is provided for the
wounded, that with whatever strength they have they may drag themselves with their whole
body, and betake themselves to their camp, wherein being received, they may heal their
wounds with spiritual medicaments. Thus the dove received, after the intervention of a few
days, is again sent forth from the ark; and returning, not only shows its firm footsteps, but
moreover the signs of its peace and victory, in those olive leaves which it bore in its mouth.
Therefore that twofold sending forth shows to us a twofold trial of persecution: the first, in

which they who have lapsed have fallen conquered; the second, in which they who have
fallen have come out conquerors. For to none of us is it doubtful or uncertain, beloved
brethren, that they who in the first struggle—that is, in the Decian persecution—were
wounded; afterwards, that is in the second encounter, persevered so bravely, that, despising
the edicts of the princes of the world,5366 they maintained that unconquered; in that they
did not fear, after the example of the good Shepherd, to give up their life, and to shed their
blood, and not to shrink from any barbarity of the raging tyrant.</p>
<p>7. Behold how glorious, how dear to the Lord, are the people whom these schismatics
do not shrink from calling “wood, hay, stubble;”5367 the equals of whom, that is, those who
are even still placed in the same guilt of their lapse, they presume must not be admitted to
repentance. This they judge from that utterance of the Lord, where He says, “Whosoever
shall deny me before men, him will I deny before my Father which is in heaven.”5368 Oh
grief! why do they strive against the Lord’s precepts, that this offspring of Novatian, following
the example of his father the devil, should now endeavour to put in force those things which
Christ will do in the time of His judgment? that is, when Scripture says, “Vengeance is mine;
and I will repay, saith the Lord.”5369</p>
<p>8. We will answer them as to that utterance of the Lord, which they ill understand, and
ill explain to themselves. For that He says, “Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will
I also deny before my Father which is in heaven,” its meaning is assuredly with respect to
future time—to the time at which the Lord shall begin to judge the secrets of men—to the
time at which we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ—to the time at which
many shall begin to say, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name
cast out devils, and in Thy name done many wonderful works?”5370 And yet they shall hear
the voice of the Lord saying, “Depart from me, all ye that have worked iniquity: I know you
not.”5371 Then shall it be fulfilled that He says, “I also will deny them.” But whom will the
Lord Christ chiefly deny, if not all of you heretics, and schismatics, and strangers to His
name? For ye who were some time Christians, but now are Novatians, no longer Christians,
have changed your first faith by a subsequent perfidy in the calling of your name. I should
wish you to reply to your own proposition. Read and teach: whom of those who had failed
or denied Him, while He was still with them, did our Lord deny? Yet also to the others of
the disciples who had remained with Him He saith, “Will ye also go away?”5372 Even Peter,

whom He had previously foretold as about to deny Him, when he had denied Him, He did
not deny, but sustained; and He Himself soothed him when subsequently bitterly bewailing
his denial.</p>
<p>9. What sort of folly is thine, Novatian, only to read what tends to the destruction of
salvation, and to pass by what tends to mercy, when Scripture cries, and says, “Repent, ye
who err: be converted in heart;”5373 and when the same prophet also exhorts, and says, “Be
converted unto me with all your heart, in fasting, and weeping, and mourning; and rend
your hearts, and not your garments; be ye converted to the Lord your God: for He is merciful,
and one who pities with great compassion?”5374</p>
<p>10. Thus we have heard that the Lord is of great compassion. Let us hear what the Holy
Spirit testifies by David: “If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my commandments;
if they should profane my righteousness, and should not keep my precepts; I will visit their
crimes with a rod, and their sins with stripes. But my mercy will I not utterly disperse from
them.”5375 Words like to these we read that the Lord said also by Ezekiel: “Son of man, the
house of Israel has dwelt on its own land, and they have defiled it by their crimes: their uncleanness
has become like that of a menstruous woman before my face. I have poured out
my anger upon them, and I have scattered them among the nations; and I have judged them
according to their sins, because they have defiled my holy name; and because it was said of
them, “This is the people of the Lord, I have spared them, because of my holy name, which
the house of Israel despised among the nations.”5376 And in conjunction with this he says,
“Therefore say to the people of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, I spare you not, O house of Israel;
but I will spare you on account of my holy name, which ye have defiled among they nations:
and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall be sanctified in you.” Also the Lord to
the same: “Son of man, say unto the people of Israel, Wherefore have ye spoken, saying,
We are pining away in our sins, and how shall we be able to be saved? Say unto them, I live,
saith the Lord: for I do not desire the death of the sinner; but I desire that the sinner should
turn from his evil way, and live: therefore return ye from your evil way: why do ye give
yourselves over to death, O house of Israel?”5377 So, too, by Isaiah the prophet: “I will not
be angry with you for ever, nor will I abstain from defending you always.”5378 And because
Jeremiah the prophet, in the person of the sinful people, prays to the Lord, saying, “Amend
us, O Lord, but in judgment, and not in anger, lest Thou make us few;”5379 Isaiah also added,

and said, “For his sin I have slightly afflicted him; and I have stricken him, and have turned
away my face from him: and he was afflicted, and went away sadly in his ways.”5380 And
because he labours, he added and said, “I have seen his ways, and I have healed him; and I
have given him a true exhortation, peace upon peace;”5381 that to those who repent, and
pray, and labour, restoration is possible, because they would miserably perish, and because
they would decline from Christ.</p>
<p>11. Moreover, this is proved in the Gospel, where is described that woman who was a
sinner, who came to the house of a certain Pharisee whither the Lord had been bidden with
His disciples, and she brought a vessel of ointment, and stood at the Lord’s feet, and washed
His feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair, and pressed kisses upon them; so that
that Pharisee was provoked, and said, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who and
what sort of a woman this is who touches him; for she is a sinner.”5382 Whence immediately
the Lord, the remitter of sins and the receiver of the penitent, says, “Simon, I have somewhat
to say unto thee. And he answered, saying, Master, say on. And the Lord, There was a certain
creditor which had two debtors; one who had5383 five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
When they had nothing to pay, he forgave both. And He asked, Which of these loved most?
And Simon answered, Assuredly he to whom he forgave most. And He added, saying, Seest
thou that woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no kiss; but she hath not ceased
to kiss my feet; thou washedst not my feet, but she has washed them with her tears, and
wiped them with her hair; thou didst not anoint my feet with oil, but she hath anointed
them. Wherefore I say unto thee, Simon, that her sins are forgiven her.” Behold, the Lord
grants the debt with His liberal kindness to both debtors; behold Him who pardons sins;
behold the woman who was a sinner, penitent, weeping, praying, and receiving remission
of her sins!</p>
<p>12. And now blush if thou canst, Novatian; cease to deceive the unwary with thy impious
arguments; cease to frighten them with the subtlety of one particular. We read, and adore,
and do not pass over the heavenly judgment of the Lord, where he says that He will deny
him who denies Him. But does this mean the penitent? And why should I be taking pains
so long to prove individual cases of mercies? since the mercy of God is not indeed denied
to the Ninevites, although strangers, and placed apart from the law of the Lord, when they
beseech it on account of the overthrow announced to their city. Nor to Pharaoh himself,
resisting with sacrilegious boldness, when formerly he was stricken with plagues from
heaven, and, turning to Moses and to his brother, said, “Pray to the Lord for me, for I have

sinned.”5384 At once the anger of God was suspended from him. And yet thou, O Novatian,
judgest and declarest that the lapsed have no hope of peace and mercy, nor inclinest thine
ear to the rebuke of the apostle, when he says, “Who art thou, who judgest another man’s
servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall stand. God is mighty to establish
him.”5385 Whence pertinently and needfully the Holy Spirit, in the person of those
same lapsed people, rebukes you when He says, “Rejoice not over me, O mine enemy: because
if I have fallen, I shall also rise again; and if I shall walk in darkness, the Lord is my light. I
will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He justify
my cause, and execute judgment and justice, and bring me forth to the light. I shall behold
His righteousness; and she that is mine enemy shall see me, and shall cover herself with
confusion.”5386</p>
<p>13. I beseech thee, hast thou not read, “Boast not, and speak not loftily, and let not arrogancy
proceed out of your mouth: for the Lord lifteth the poor from the earth; He raiseth
up the beggar from the dunghill, and maketh him to sit with the mighty ones of the
people?”5387 Hast thou not read, that “the Lord resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
humble?”5388 Hast thou not read, “Whoso exalteth himself shall be humbled?”5389 Hast
thou not read, that “God destroys the remembrance of the proud, and does not forsake the
memory of the lowly?” Hast thou not read, that “with what judgment a man shall judge he
must be judged?”5390 Hast thou not read, that “he who hateth his brother is in darkness,
and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath
blinded his eyes?”5391 Whence, then, this Novatian has become both so wicked and so lost,
so mad with rage of discord, I cannot discover, since he always in one household—that is,
the Church of Christ—would have bewailed the sins of his neighbours as his own;5392 would
have borne the burthens of his brethren, as the apostle exhorts; would have strengthened
the faltering in the faith with heavenly counsel. But now, from the time when he began to
practise that heresy of Cain which only delights in slaying, he does not even of late spare
himself. But if he had read that “the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in
the day on which he shall have erred, and the wickedness of the wicked shall not harm him

from the day in which he shall have been converted,”5393 he would long ago have repented
in ashes, who is always opposed to penitents; who labours more readily in the destruction
of those things which are built and standing, than in the building up of those which are
prostrate; who has once more made heathens of many most wretched brethren of ours,
terrified by his false oppositions, by saying that the repentance of the lapsed is vain, and
cannot avail them for salvation, although the Scripture cries aloud and says, “Remember
whence thou hast fallen, and repent, or else I will come to thee except thou repent.”5394 And
indeed, writing to the seven churches, rebuking each one of them with its own crimes and
sins, it said, Repent. To whom but to them, doubtless, whom He had redeemed at the great
price of His blood?</p>
<p>14. O impious and wicked as thou art, thou heretic Novatian! who after so many and
great crimes which in past times thou hadst known to be voluntarily committed in the
Church, and before thou thyself wast an apostate in the family of God, hadst certainly taught
that these might be abolished from memory if well-doing followed; according to the faith
of the Scripture which says, “But if the wicked will turn from all his sins which he hath
committed, and will do righteousness, he shall live in eternal life, and shall not die in his
wickedness.”5395 For the sins which he has committed shall be abolished from memory by
the good deeds which succeed. Thou reconsiderest now, whether the wounds of the lapsed
who have fallen, stripped bare by the devil, ought to be cured; dashed down, as they are, by
the “violence of the flood which the serpent sent forth from his mouth after the woman.”5396
But “What shall I say?” says the apostle. “Do I praise you? In this I praise you not; that ye
come together not for the better, but for the worse.”5397 For where there are “rivalries and
dissensions among you, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?”5398 Nor indeed
ought we to wonder why this Novatian should dare now to practise such wicked, such severe
things against the person of the lapsed, since we have previous examples of this kind of
prevarication. Saul, that once good5399 man, besides other things, is subsequently overthrown
by envy, and strives to do everything that is harsh and hostile against David. That Judas,
who was chosen among the apostles, who was always of one mind and faithful in the house
of God, himself subsequently betrayed God.5400</p>

<p>And indeed the Lord had foretold that many should come as ravening wolves in the
skins of sheep. Who are those ravening wolves but such as conspire with treacherous intent
to waste the flock of Christ? As we read it written in Zechariah: “Lo, I raise up a shepherd
in the land, who shall not visit that which is turned away, and will eat the flesh of the chosen,
and tear their claws in pieces.”5401 Similarly also in Ezekiel he rebukes shepherds of this
kind, to wit, robbers and butchers (I will speak as he had thought5402), saying, “O shepherds,
wherefore do ye drink the milk, and eat up the curdled milk, and have brought that which
is strong to nothing, and have not visited the weak, have not healed the halting, and have
not recalled the wandering, and have permitted my people to wander among thorns and
briers? For these things, says the Lord, lo, I will come against the shepherds, and I will require
my sheep of their hands; and I will drive them away, that they may not feed my sheep; and
my sheep shall no more be for them to devour, and I will seek them out as a shepherd his
flock in the day in which there shall be darkness and cloud. Thus I will seek out my sheep,
and I will seek them out in every place wherever they are scattered; and I will seek out what
had perished, and I will recall what had wandered, and what had halted I will heal, and what
is weak I will watch over; and I will feed my sheep with judgment.”5403</p>
<p>15. Who is it that says these things? Certainly He who, having left the ninety and nine
sheep, went to seek that one which had wandered from His flock; as David says, “I have
gone astray like a sheep which was lost,”5404 which being found Christ brings back, bearing
on His shoulder the tender sinful one; and He, rejoicing and exulting, having called His
friends and domestics, says, “Rejoice with me; for my sheep which was lost is found. I say,”
says He, “unto you, that there will be such joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.”5405
And in continuation, He says: “Or what woman, having ten denarii, if she should lose one
of the denarii, does not light a lamp, and all the day long clean out her house, seeking till
she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbours, saying,
Rejoice with me; for I have found the denarius that I had lost. I say unto you, that such joy
shall be in the sight of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.”5406 But, on the
other hand, they who do not repent of their wickedness, let them know from the answer of
the Lord Himself what remaineth for them; for we read in the Gospel, that “certain men
came from the Galileans to the Lord, telling Him of those whose blood Pilate mingled with
<note type="footnote">5401 Zech. xi. 16.</note>

their sacrifices; to whom the Lord answered, saying, Think ye that those Galileans had been
sinners above other Galileans, because they suffered such things? No; for I say unto you,
unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in
Siloam fell, think ye that they were debtors to death above all men who dwell in Jerusalem?
No; I say unto you,” said He, “that unless ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.”5407</p>
<p>16. Let us then arouse ourselves as much as we can, beloved brethren; and breaking
away from the slumber of indolence and security, let us be watchful for the observance of
the Lord’s precepts. Let us with all our hearts seek for what we have lost, that we may be
able to find; because “to him that seeketh,” says the Scripture, “it shall be given, and to him
that knocketh it shall be opened.”5408 Let us cleanse our house with spiritual cleanliness,
that every secret and hidden place of our breast, truly enlightened by the light of the Gospel,
may say, “Against Thee only have I sinned, and done this great evil in Thy sight.”5409 Because
the death of sinners is evil, and in hell there is no repentance. Let us have in contemplation
especially the day of judgment and retribution, and what must be believed by all of us, and
firmly maintained, that “there is no acceptance of persons with God;”5410 since He commanded
in Deuteronomy, that the person must not be accepted in judgment: “Thou shalt
not accept,” says He, “the person, neither shalt thou judge according to the least nor according
to the greatest.”5411 Like words to these He also said by Ezekiel: “All souls,” said He, “are
mine; as the soul of the father, so is the soul of the son: the soul that hath sinned, it shall
die.”5412 It is then He who must be revered by us; He must be held fast; He must be propitiated
by our full and worthy confession, “who has the power of sending soul and body to the
Gehenna of fire,”5413—as it is written, “Behold, He cometh with many thousands of His
messengers, to execute judgment upon all, and to destroy all the wicked, and to condemn
all flesh, for all the deeds of the wicked which they have wickedly done, and for all the impious
words which sinners have spoken about God.”5414</p>
<p>17. Like things to these also says Daniel: “I beheld a throne placed, and the Ancient of
days sat upon it, and His clothing was as it were snow, and the hairs of His head as it were
white wool: His throne was a flame of fire, its wheels were burning fire. A river of fire came

forth before Him: thousand thousands ministered to Him, and thousand thousands stood
before Him: He sat to judgment, and the books were opened.”5415 And John still more
plainly declares, both about the day of judgment and the consummation of the world, saying,
“And when,” said he, “He had opened the sixth seal, lo, there was a great earthquake; and
the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as of blood; and the
stars fell to the earth, even as a fig-tree, shaken by a mighty wind, casteth her unripe figs.
And the heaven departed as a book when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island
were moved from their places. And the kings of the earth, and all the great men, and the
tribunes, and the rich men, and the strong men, and every slave, and every free man, hid
themselves in the caves and in the caverns of the mountains; saying to the mountains and
to the rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the sight of the Father that sitteth upon the
throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: because the day of destruction cometh; and who
shall be able to stand?”5416 Also in the same Apocalypse John says that this too was revealed
to him. “I saw,” says he, “a great throne, and one in white who sat upon it, from whose face
the heaven and the earth fled away; and their place was not found. And I saw the dead, great
and small, standing before the sight of the Lord’s throne: and the books were opened; and
another book was opened, which is (the book) of life: and every one was judged according
to those things that were written in the book, according to their own works.”5417 Moreover,
too, the apostle, giving good advice, thus exhorts us, saying, “Let no one deceive you with
vain words: for because of these things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience.
Be not partakers with them.”5418</p>
<p>18. Let us, then, with the whole strength of our faith, give praise to God; let us give our
full confession, since the powers of heaven rejoice over our repentance, all the angels rejoice,
and Christ also rejoices, who once again with full and merciful moderation exhorts us, laden
with sins, overwhelmed with crimes, to cease from wickedness, saying, “Turn ye, and return
from your impieties, and your iniquities shall not be to you for a punishment. Cast away
from you all your impieties which ye have committed against me; and make to yourselves
a new heart and a new spirit. And why do ye deliver yourselves over to death, O house of
Israel? For I do not desire the death of the sinner.”5419 “I am He, I am He who blot out thy
crimes, and I will not remember them. But do thou have in mind, and let us judge; tell thou
thy wickednesses first, that thou mayest be justified.”5420 While the way of mercy, brethren,

is open,5421 let us entreat God with full atonements; let us humble ourselves, that we may
be exalted; let us acquiesce in the divine exhortation, whereby we may escape the day of the
Lord and His anger. For thus He says: “Look, my son, upon the nations of men, and know
who hath hoped in the Lord, and has been confounded; or has remained in His commandments,
and has been forsaken; or has called upon Him, and He has despised him. For the
Lord is loving and merciful, and forgiving in time of tribulation their sins to all those that
seek after Him in truth.”5422 Therefore He says, “First tell thou thy sins, that thou mayest
be justified.” Let there be first in your hand that prayer full of confession.5423</p>

<head>Introductory Notice.5424
to
Anonymous Treatise on Re-baptism.</head>
<p>The following treatise on Re-baptism has been attributed by some authorities to the
pen of one Ursinus,5425 a monk, who is said to have written in the fourth century. But internal
evidence seems to point to a bishop as having been the writer;5426 and it seems very
probable that it was written while the baptismal controversy was still agitating the Church,
from the manner in which he refers to it. Moreover, the bitter attack contained in the first
chapter was probably levelled against Cyprian, as the leader of the party in favour of the rebaptism
of heretics. And this would hardly have been the case, at least the attack would not
have been characterized by the same rancour, if Cyprian had already suffered martyrdom,
and the controversy had lost its acrimony and intensity.</p>
<p>Rigaltius, who first edited the treatise, among his notes to the works of Cyprian, judged
that it was written about the time of that Father. And Fell, Cave, Tillemont, and Galland,
are of the same opinion. The two latter, indeed, conjecture that it was actually intended
against Cyprian.</p>
<p>The difficulty arising to the translator from a loose and rambling style, and very involved
argument, has been enhanced by a text singularly uncertain; but he ventures to think that
there are points in the treatment of the subject which will not be without interest to the
theological student of the present day, although its immediate purpose has passed away.</p>

<head>A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.</head>
<p>Argument.—That They Who Have Once Been Washed in the Name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, Ought Not to Be Re-Baptized.</p>
<p>1. I observe that it has been asked among the brethren what course ought specially to
be adopted towards the persons of those who, although baptized in heresy, have yet been
baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,5427 and subsequently departing from their
heresy, and fleeing as supplicants to the Church of God, should repent with their whole
hearts, and only now perceiving the condemnation of their error, implore from the Church
the help of salvation. The point is whether, according to the most ancient custom and ecclesiastical
tradition, it would suffice, after that baptism which they have received outside the
Church indeed, but still in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, that only hands should be laid
upon them by the bishop for their reception of the Holy Spirit, and this imposition of hands
would afford them the renewed and perfected seal of faith; or whether, indeed, a repetition
of baptism would be necessary for them, as if they should receive nothing if they had not
obtained baptism afresh, just as if they were never baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And
therefore some things were talked about as having been written and replied on this new
question, wherein both sides endeavoured with the greatest eagerness to demolish what had
been written by their antagonists. In which kind of debate, as it appears to me, no controversy
or discussion could have arisen at all if each one of us had been content with the venerable
authority of all the churches,5428 and with becoming humility had desired to innovate
nothing, as observing no kind of room for contradiction. For everything which is both
doubtful and ambiguous, and is established in opinions differing among those of prudent
and faithful men, if it is judged to be against the ancient and memorable and most solemn
observance of all those holy and faithful men who have deserved well, ought assuredly to
be condemned; since in a matter once arranged and ordained, whatever that is which is
brought forward against the quiet and peace of the Church, will result in nothing but discords,
and strifes, and schisms. And in this no other fruit can be found but this alone; that one
man, whoever he is, should be vain-gloriously declared among certain fickle men to be of
great prudence and constancy: and, being gifted with the arrogance of heretics, whose only
consolation in destruction is the not appearing to sin alone, should be renowned among
those that are most similar and agreeable to himself, as having corrected the errors and vices
of all the churches. For this is the desire and purpose of all heretics, to frame as many
<note type="footnote">5427 [“In the name,” etc., implies as Jesus Christ commanded, St. Matt. xxviii. 19.]</note>
<note type="footnote">5428 [This was assumed by the Westerns to be the general rule, whereas it was only local. See p. 408, note 7,
supra.]</note>

<pb n="1568"/>
calumnies of this kind as possible against our most holy mother the Church, and to deem
it a great glory to have discovered anything that can be imputed to her as a crime, or even
as a folly. And since it becomes no faithful man of sound mind to dare to hold such a view,
especially no one who is ordained in any clerical office at all, and much more in the episcopal
order, it is like a prodigy for bishops themselves to devise such scandals, and not to fear to
unfold too irreverently against the precept of the law and of all the Scriptures, with their
own disgrace and risk, the disgrace of their mother the Church—if they think that there is
any disgrace in this matter; although the Church has no disgrace in this instance, save in
the error of such men as these themselves. Therefore it is the more grievous sin in men of
this kind, if that which is blamed by them in the most ancient observance, as if it were not
rightly done, is manifestly and forcibly shown as well to have been rightly observed by those
who were before us, as to be rightly observed also by us; so that even if we should engage in
the controversy with equal arguments on both sides, yet, since that which was innovated
could not be established without dissension among the brethren and mischief to the Church,
assuredly it ought not,—right or wrong, as they say, that is, contrary to what is good and
proper—rashly to be flung like a stain upon our mother the Church; and the ignominy of
this audacity and impiety ought with reason to be attached to those who should attempt
this. But since it is not in our power, according to the apostle’s precept, “to speak the same
thing, that there be not schisms among us;”5429 yet, as far as we can, we strive to demonstrate
the true condition of this argument, and to persuade turbulent men, even now, to mind
their own business, as we shall even attain a great deal if they will at length acquiesce in this
sound advice.5430 And therefore we shall, as is needful, collect into one mass whatever passages
of the Holy Scriptures are pertinent to this subject. And we shall manifestly harmonize,
as far as possible, those which seem to be differing or of various meaning; and we shall to
the extent of our poor ability examine both the utility and advantage of each method, that
we may recommend to all the brethren, that the most wholesome form and peaceful custom
be adopted in the Church.</p>
<p>2. To such, then, as approach to a discussion of saving and modern, that is, of spiritual
and evangelical baptism, there occurs first of all the announcement universally well known,
made and begun by John the Baptist, who, somewhat departing from the law, that is, from
the most ancient baptism of Moses, and preparing the way of the new and true grace, both
preoccupied the ears of the Jews gradually by the baptism of water and of repentance which
for the time he practised, and took possession of them with the announcement of a spiritual
<note type="footnote">5429 1 Cor. i. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">5430 [The bitterness with which Vincent follows up the assumption, that there was a general custom of all
the churches, shows how sadly this controversy became envenomed in the West. Cap. vi. is a blemish on his

baptism that was to come, exhorting them, and saying, “He that cometh after me is mightier
than I, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose: He shall baptize you with the Holy
Ghost, and with fire;”5431 and for this reason we also ought to make a beginning of this
discourse from this point. For in the Acts of the Apostles, the Lord after His resurrection,
confirming this same word of John, “commanded them that they should not depart from
Jerusalem, but wait for that promise of the Father which, saith He, ye have heard from me;
for John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
days hence.”5432 And Peter also related these same words of the Lord, when he gave an account
of himself to the apostles, saying: “And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell upon
them as on us at the beginning; and I remembered the word of the Lord, how that He said,
John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. If, therefore,
He gave them a like gift as to us, who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I
could withstand the Lord?”5433 And again: “Men and brethren, ye know how from ancient
days God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of
the Gospel, and believe. And God, who knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them
the Holy Spirit, even as He did unto us.”5434 And on this account we ought to consider what
is the force and power of this saying. For the Lord says to them who would have to be subsequently
baptized because they should believe, that they must be baptized not in like
manner as by Him in water, unto repentance, but in the Holy Ghost. And of this announcement,
as assuredly none of us can doubt it, it is plain on what principle men were baptized
in the Holy Spirit. For it was peculiarly in the Holy Spirit Himself alone that they who believed
were baptized. For John distinguished, and said that he indeed baptized in water, but that
one should come who would baptize in the Holy Ghost, by the grace and power of God;
and they are so by the Spirit’s bestowal and operation of hidden results. Moreover, they are
so no less in the baptism of the Spirit and of water. They are so, besides, also in the baptism
of every one in his own proper blood.5435 Even as the Holy Scriptures declare to us, from
which we shall adduce evident proofs throughout each individual instance of those things
which we shall narrate.</p>
<p>3. And to these things thou perchance, who art bringing in some novelty, mayest immediately
and impatiently reply, as thou art wont, that the Lord said in the Gospel: “Except a
man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.”
5436 Whence it manifestly appears that that baptism alone is profitable wherein also the

<pb n="1570"/>
Holy Spirit can dwell; for that upon the Lord Himself, when He was baptized, the Holy
Spirit descended, and that His deed and word are quite in harmony, and that such a mystery
can consist with no other principle. To which reply none of us is found either so senseless
or so stubborn as to dare, contrary to right or contrary to truth, to object, for instance, so
to the doing of things in their integrity, and by all means in the Church, and the observation
of them according to the order of discipline perpetually by us. But if, in the same New
Testament, those things which in that matter we come upon as associated, be sometimes
found in some sort divided, and separated, and arranged, and ordered just as if they were
by themselves; let us see whether these solitary instances by themselves may not sometimes
be such as are not imperfect, but, as it were, entire and complete. For when by imposition
of the bishop’s hands the Holy Spirit is given to every one that believes, as in the case of the
Samaritans, after Philip’s baptism, the apostles did to them by laying on of hands; in this
manner also they conferred on them the Holy Spirit. And that this might be the case, they
themselves prayed for them, for as yet the Holy Spirit had not descended upon any of them,
but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Moreover, our Lord after
His resurrection, when He had breathed upon His apostles, and had said to them, “Receive
ye the Holy Ghost,”5437 thus and thus only bestowed upon them the Spirit.</p>
<p>4. And this being found to be so, what thinkest thou, my brother? If a man be not baptized
by a bishop, so as even at once to have the imposition of hands, and should yet die
before having received the Holy Spirit, should you judge him to have received salvation or
not? Because, indeed, both the apostles themselves and the disciples, who also baptized
others, and were themselves baptized by the Lord, did not at once receive the Holy Spirit,
for He had not as yet been given, because that Jesus had not as yet been glorified. And after
His resurrection no small interval of time elapsed before that took place,—even as also the
Samaritans, when they were baptized by Philip, did not receive the gift until the apostles invited
from Jerusalem to Samaria went down to them to lay hands upon them, and conferred
on them the Holy Spirit by the imposition of hands. Because in that interval of time any
one of them who had not attained the Holy Spirit, might have been cut off by death, and
die defrauded of the grace of the Holy Spirit. And it cannot be doubted also, that in the
present day this sort of thing is usual, and happens frequently, that many after baptism depart
from this life without imposition of the bishop’s hands, and yet are esteemed perfected believers.
Just as the Ethiopian eunuch, when he was returning from Jerusalem and reading
the prophet Isaiah, and was in doubt, having at the Spirit’s suggestion heard the truth from
Philip the deacon, believed and was baptized; and when he had gone up out of the water,
the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more. For he went on
his way rejoicing, although, as thou observest, hands were not laid on him by the bishop,
<note type="footnote">5437 John xx. 22.</note>

<pb n="1571"/>
that he might receive the Holy Spirit. But if thou admittest this, and believest it to be saving,
and dost not gainsay the opinion of all the faithful, thou must needs confess this, that even
as this principle proceeds to be more largely discussed, that other also can be more broadly
established; that is, that by the imposition of hands alone of the bishop—because baptism
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ has gone before it—may the Holy Spirit also be given
to another man who repents and believes. Because the Holy Scripture has affirmed that they
who should believe in Christ, must needs be baptized in the Spirit; so that these also may
not seem to have anything less than those who are perfectly Christians; lest it should be
needful to ask what sort of a thing was that baptism which they have attained in the name
of Jesus Christ. Unless, perchance, in that former discussion also, about those who should
only have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, thou shouldst decide that they can be
saved even without the Holy Spirit, or that the Holy Spirit is not accustomed to be bestowed
in this manner only, but by the imposition of the bishop’s hands; or even shouldst say that
it is not the bishop alone who can bestow the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>5. And if this be so, and the occurrence of any of these things cannot deprive a man who
believes, of salvation, thou thyself also affirmest that the fact of the mystery of the faith being
divided in a manner, and its not being, as thou contendest, consummated, where necessity
intervenes, cannot take away salvation from a believing and penitent man. Or if thou sayest
that a man of this kind cannot be saved, we deprive all bishops of salvation, whom thou
thus engagest, under risks as assured as possible, to be bound themselves to afford help to
all those who live under their care, and are in weak health, in their districts, scattered up
and down, because other men of less degree among the clerics who venture cannot confer
the same benefit; so that the blood of those who shall appear to have departed from this life
without the benefit would have, of necessity, to be required at the hands of the bishops. And
further, as you are not ignorant, the Holy Spirit is found to have been given to men who
believe, by the Lord without baptism of water, as is contained in the Acts of the Apostles
after this manner: “While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell upon all
them who heard the word. And they who were of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the
gift of the Holy Spirit. For they heard them speak with their tongues, and they magnified
God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized
in the name of Jesus Christ.”5438 Even as Peter also subsequently most abundantly taught
us about the same Gentiles, saying: “And He put no difference between us and them, their
hearts being purified by faith.”5439 And there will be no doubt that men may be baptized
<note type="footnote">5438 Acts x. 44–48.</note>
<note type="footnote">5439 Acts xv. 9.</note>

<pb n="1572"/>
with the Holy Ghost without water,—as thou observest that these were baptized before they
were baptized with water; that the announcements of both John and of our Lord Himself
were satisfied,—forasmuch as they received the grace of the promise both without the imposition
of the apostle’s hands and without the laver, which they attained afterwards. And
their hearts being purified, God bestowed upon them at the same time, in virtue of their
faith, remission of sins; so that the subsequent baptism conferred upon them this benefit
alone, that they received also the invocation of the name of Jesus Christ, that nothing might
appear to be wanting to the integrity of their service and faith.5440</p>
<p>6. And this also,—looking at it from the opposite side of this discussion,—those disciples
of our Lord themselves attained, upon whom, being previously baptized, the Holy Spirit at
length came down on the day of Pentecost, descending from heaven indeed by the will of
God, not of His own accord, but effused for this very office, and moreover upon each one
of them. Although these were already righteous, and, as we have said, had been baptized
by the Lord’s baptism even as the apostles themselves, who nevertheless are found on the
night on which He was apprehended to have all deserted Him. And even Peter himself, who
boasted that he would persevere in his faith, and most obstinately resisted the prediction of
the Lord Himself, yet at last denied Him, that by this means it might be shown to us, that
whatever sins they had contracted in the meantime and in any manner, these same sins, by
the faith in them subsequently attested as sincere, were without doubt put away by the
baptism of the Holy Spirit. Nor, as I think, was it for any other reason that the apostles had
charged those whom they addressed in the Holy Spirit, that they should be baptized in the
name of Christ Jesus, except that the power of the name of Jesus invoked upon any man by
baptism might afford to him who should be baptized no slight advantage for the attainment
of salvation, as Peter relates in the Acts of the Apostles, saying: “For there is none other
name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.”5441 As also the Apostle
Paul unfolds, showing that God hath exalted our Lord Jesus, and “given Him a name, that
it may be above every name, that in the name of Jesus all should bow the knee, of things
heavenly and earthly, and under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus is
Lord in the glory of God the Father.” And he on whom, when he should be baptized, invocation
should be made in the name of Jesus, although he might obtain baptism under some
error, still would not be hindered from knowing the truth at some time or another, and
correcting his error, and coming to the Church and to the bishop, and sincerely confessing
our Jesus before men; so that then, when hands were laid upon him by the bishop, he might
also receive the Holy Spirit, and he would not lose that former invocation of the name of
<note type="footnote">5440 [It was a notable compliance with the example of Christ, Matt. iii. 15. “They had received,” etc., yet that
was no reason why the ordinance of Christ should be slighted.]</note>
<note type="footnote">5441 Acts iv. 12.</note>

<pb n="1573"/>
Jesus. Which none of us may disallow, although this invocation, if it be standing bare and
by itself, could not suffice for affording salvation, lest on this principle we should believe
that even Gentiles and heretics, who abuse the name of Jesus, could attain unto salvation
without the true and entire thing. Yet it is extremely useful to believe that this invocation
of the name of Jesus, together with the correction of error and the acknowledgment of the
belief of the truth, and with the putting away of all stain of past conversation, if rightly performed
with the mystery of God among men of this kind, obtains a place which it would
not have had, and finally, in the true faith and for the maintenance of the integrity of the
sign, is no hindrance, when its supplement which had been wanting is added; and that it is
consistent with good reason, with the authority of so many years, and so many churches
and apostles and bishops; even as it is the very greatest disadvantage and damage to our
most holy mother Church, now for the first time suddenly and without reason to rebel
against former decisions after so long a series of so many ages. For not for any other reason
Peter—who had already been baptized and had been asked what he thought of the Lord by
the Lord Himself, and the truth of the revelation of the Father in heaven being bestowed on
him had confessed that Christ was not only our Lord, but was the Son of the living God—was
shown subsequently to have withstood the same Christ when He made announcement of
His passion, and therefore was set forth as being called Satan. For no other reason except
because it would come to pass that some, although varying in their own judgment, and
somewhat halting in faith and doctrine, although they were baptized in the name of Jesus,
yet, if they had been able to rescind their error in some interval of time, were not on that
account cut off from salvation; but at any time that they had come to the right mind, obtained
by repentance a sound hope of salvation, especially when they received the Holy Spirit, to
be baptized by Whom is the duty of every man, they would have intended some such thing.
Even as we do not apprehend that Peter in the Gospel suffered this alone, but all the disciples,
to whom, though already baptized, the Lord afterwards says, that “all ye shall be offended
in me,”5442 all of whom, as we observe, having amended their faith, were baptized after the
Lord’s resurrection with the Holy Spirit. So that not without reason we also in the present
day may believe that men, amended from their former error, may be baptized in the Holy
Spirit, who, although they were baptized with water in the name of the Lord, might have
had a faith somewhat imperfect. Because it is of great importance whether a man is not
baptized at all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, or indeed whether in some respect he
halts when he is baptized with the baptism of water, which is of less account provided that
afterwards a sincere faith in the truth is evident in the baptism of the Spirit, which undoubtedly
is of greater account.</p>
<note type="footnote">5442 Mark xiv. 27.</note>

<pb n="1574"/>
<p>7. Neither must you esteem what our Lord said as being contrary to this treatment: “Go
ye, teach the nations; baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.”5443 Because, although this is true and right, and to be observed by all means
in the Church, and moreover has been used to be observed, yet it behoves us to consider
that invocation of the name of Jesus ought not to be thought futile by us on account of the
veneration and power of that very name, in which name all kinds of power are accustomed
to be exercised, and occasionally some even by men outside the Church. But to what effect
are those words of Christ, who said that He would deny, and not know, those who should
say to Him in the day of judgment, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and
in Thy name cast out demons, and in Thy name done many wonderful works,” when He
answered them, even with emphasis,5444 “I never knew you; depart from me, ye who work
iniquity,”5445 unless that it should be shown to us, that even by those who work iniquity
might these good works also be done, by the superfluous5446 energy of the name of Christ?
Therefore ought this invocation of the name of Jesus to be received as a certain beginning
of the mystery of the Lord common to us and to all others, which may afterwards be filled
up with the remaining things. Otherwise such an invocation would not avail if it should
remain alone, because after the death of a man in this position there cannot be added to
him anything at all, nor supplemented, nor can, in anything, avail him in the day of judgment,
when they shall begin to be reproached by our Lord with those things which we have above
mentioned, none of whom notwithstanding in this present time may by any man be so
hardly and cruelly prohibited from aiding themselves in those ways which we have above
shown.</p>
<p>8. But these things thou wilt, as thou art wont, contradict, by objecting to us, that when
they baptized, the disciples were baptized perfectly, and rightly, and not as these heretics;
and this thou must needs assume from their condition, and His who baptized them. And
therefore we reply to this proposition of thine, not as accusers of the Lord’s disciples, but
as we are constrained, because it is necessary that we should investigate by reasons where
and when, and in what measure, salvation has been bestowed on each of us. For that our
Lord was born, and that He was the Christ, appeared by many reasons to be believed, not
unjustly, by His disciples, because He had been born of the tribe of Judah, of the family of
David, and in the city of Bethlehem; and because He had been announced to the shepherds
by the angels at the same moment that there was born to them a Saviour; because His star
being seen in the east, He had been most anxiously sought for and adored by the Magi, and

<note type="footnote">5446 [Query, superabounding?]</note>

<pb n="1575"/>
honoured with illustrious presents and distinguished offerings; because while still a youth,
sitting in the temple with the doctors of the law, He wisely, and with the admiration of all,
had disputed; because when He was baptized He had been glorified, as had happened to
none others, by the descent of the Holy Spirit from the opened heavens, and by its abode
upon Him; and moreover by the testimony of His Father, and also of John the Baptist; because,
beyond the inferior capacity of man, He understood the hearts and thoughts of all
men; because He cured and healed weaknesses, and vices, and diseases, with very great
power; because He bestowed remissions of sins, with manifest attestation; because He expelled
demons at His bidding; because He purified lepers with a word; because, by converting
water into wine, He enlarged the nuptial festivity with marvellous joyfulness; because He
restored or granted sight to the blind; because He maintained the doctrine of the Father
with all confidence; because in a desert place He satisfied five thousand men with five loaves;
because the remains and the fragments filled more than twelve baskets; because He everywhere
raised up the dead, according to His mercy; because He commanded the winds and
the sea to be still; because He walked with His feet upon the sea; because He absolutely
performed all miracles.</p>
<p>9. By which things, and by many deeds of this kind tending to His glory, it appeared to
follow as a consequence, that in whatever manner the Jews think about Christ, and although
they do not believe concerning Jesus Christ our Lord, that even they themselves thought
that such and so great a one would without any death endure to eternity, and would possess
the kingdom of Israel, and of the whole world for ever; and that it should not be destroyed.
Whence, moreover, the Jews dared to seize Him by force, and anoint Him for the kingdom,
which indeed He was compelled to evade; and therefore His disciples thought that in no
other way would He bestow upon them eternal life, except He Himself had first continued
this temporal life into that eternal one in His own experience. In fine, when they were passing
through Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of
men, and they will kill Him; and after three days He shall rise again.”5447 and they were
greatly grieved, because, as we have said, they had formed a very different notion previously
in their minds and hearts. And again, this also was the speech of the Jews, in contradiction
against Him, when He taught them of Himself, and announced future things to them, and
they said, “We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou
that the Son of man must be lifted up?”5448 And so there was this same presumption concerning
Christ in the mind of the disciples, even as Peter himself, the leader and chief of the
apostles, broke forth into that expression of his own incredulity. For when he, together with
the others, had been asked by the Lord what he thought about Him, that is, whom he thought
<note type="footnote">5447 Mark ix. 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">5448 John xii. 34.</note>

<pb n="1576"/>
Him to be, and had first of all confessed the truth, saying that He was the Christ the Son of
the living God, and therefore was judged blessed by Him because he had arrived at this
truth, not after the flesh, but by the revelation of the heavenly Father; yet this same Peter,
when Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many
things from the elders, and priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after the third day rise
again from the dead; nevertheless that true confessor of Christ, after a few days, taking Him
aside, began to rebuke Him, saying, “Be propitious to Thyself: this shall not be;”5449 so that
on that account he deserved to hear from the Lord, “Get thee behind me, Satan;5450 thou
art an offence unto me, because he savoured not the things which are of God, but those
things which are of men.” Which rebuke against Peter became more and more apparent
when the Lord was apprehended, and, frightened by the damsel, he said, “I know not what
thou sayest, neither know I thee;”5451 and again when, using an oath, he said this same
thing; and for the third time, cursing and swearing, he affirmed that he knew not the man,
and not once, but frequently, denied Him.5452 And this disposition, because it was to continue
to him even to the Lord’s passion, was long before made manifest by the Lord, that
we also might not be ignorant of it. Again, after the Lord’s resurrection, one of His disciples,
Cleopas, when he was, according to the error of all his fellow-disciples, sorrowfully telling
what had happened to the Lord Himself, as if to some unknown person, spoke thus, saying
of Jesus the Nazarene, “who was a prophet mighty in deed and in word before God and all
the people; how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death,
and fastened Him to the cross. But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed
Israel.”5453 And in addition to these things, all the disciples also judged the declaration
of the women who had seen the Lord after the resurrection to be idle tales; and some
of themselves, when they had seen Him, believed not, but doubted; and they who were not
then present believed not at all until they had been subsequently by the Lord Himself in all
ways rebuked and reproached; because His death had so offended them that they thought
that He had not risen again, who they had believed ought not to have died, because contrary
to their belief He had died once. And thus, as far as concerns the disciples themselves, they

are found to have had a faith neither sound nor perfect in such matters as we have referred
to; and what is much more serious, they moreover baptized others, as it is written in the
Gospel according to John.</p>
<p>10. Besides, what wilt thou say of those who are in many cases baptized by bishops of
very bad character, who yet at length, when God so wills it, convicted of their crimes, are
even deprived of their office itself, or absolutely of communion? Or what wilt thou decide
of those who may have been baptized by bishops, whose opinions are unsound, or who are
very ignorant—when they may not have spoken clearly and honestly, or even have spoken
otherwise than is fit in the tradition of the sacrament, or at least may have asked anything,
or asking, have heard from those who answered what ought by no means to be so asked or
answered? And still this does not greatly injure that true faith of ours, although, moreover,
these more simple men may deliver the mystery of the faith without the elegance and order
that thou wouldst use. And thou wilt assuredly say, with that marvellous carefulness of thine,
that these too should be baptized again, since this is especially the thing which is wanting
to them, or hinders their being able to receive, uncorrupted, that divine and inviolable
mystery of the faith. And yet, O excellent man, let us attribute and allow to the heavenly
agencies their power, and let us concede to the condescension of the divine majesty its appropriate
operations; and understanding how great is the advantage therein, let us gladly
acquiesce in it. And thus, as our salvation is founded in the baptism of the Spirit, which for
the most part is associated with the baptism of water, if indeed baptism shall be given by
us, let it be conferred in its integrity and with solemnity, and with all those means which
are written; and let it be administered without any disconnection of anything. Or if, by the
necessity of the case, it should be administered by an inferior cleric, let us wait for the result,
that it may either be supplied by us,5454 or reserved to be supplied by the Lord. If, however,
it should have been administered by strangers, let this matter be amended as it can and as
it allows. Because outside the Church there is no Holy Spirit, sound faith moreover cannot
exist, not alone among heretics, but even among those who are established in schism. And
for that reason, they who repent and are amended by the doctrine of the truth, and by their
own faith, which subsequently has been improved by the purification of their heart, ought
to be aided only by spiritual baptism, that is, by the imposition of the bishop’s hands, and
by the ministration of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, the perfect seal of faith has been rightly
accustomed to be given in this manner and on this principle in the Church. So that the invocation
of the name of Jesus, which cannot be done away, may not seem to be held in
disesteem by us; which assuredly is not fitting; although such an invocation, if none of those
things of which we have spoken should follow it, may fail and be deprived of the effect of
salvation. For when the apostle said that there was “one baptism,”5455 it must needs have
<note type="footnote">5454 Scil. the bishop. [The plural of “solidarity.” See p. 128, note 5, supra, and Elucidation XI. p. 159.]</note>
<note type="footnote">5455 Eph. iv. 5.</note>

<pb n="1578"/>
been by the continued effect of the invocation of the name of Jesus, because, once invoked,
it cannot be taken away by any man, even although we might venture, against the decision
of the apostles, to repeat it by giving too much, yea, by the desire of superadding baptism.
If he who returns to the Church be unwilling again to be baptized, the result will be that we
may defraud him of the baptism of the Spirit, whom we think we must not defraud of the
baptism of water.</p>
<p>11. And what wilt thou determine against the person of him who hears the word,5456
and haply taken up in the name of Christ, has at once confessed, and has been punished
before it has been granted him to be baptized with water? Wilt thou declare him to have
perished because he has not been baptized with water? Or, indeed, wilt thou think that there
may be something from without that helps him to salvation, although he is not baptized
with water? Thy thinking him to have perished will be opposed by the sentence of the Lord,
who says, “Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my
Father which is in heaven;”5457 because it is no matter whether he who confesses for the
Lord is a hearer of the word or a believer, so long as he confesses that same Christ whom
he ought to confess; because the Lord, by confessing him, in turn Himself graces His confessor
before his Father with the glory of his martyrdom, as He promised. But this assuredly
ought not to be taken too liberally, as if it could be stretched to such a point as that any
heretic can confess the name of Christ who notwithstanding denies Christ Himself; that he
believes on another Christ, when Christ avows that it cannot avail him at all; forasmuch as
the Lord said that He5458 must needs be brought to confession by us before men, which
cannot be done without Him, and without veneration of His name. And therefore both5459
ought to stand by the confessor, sound, and sincere, and uncontaminated, and inviolated,
without any choice being made of the confessor himself, whether he is righteous or a sinner,
and a perfect Christian or an imperfect one, who has not feared to confess the Lord at his
own greatest peril. And this is not contrary to the former discussion, because there is left
therein time for the correction of many things which are bad, and because certain things
are conceded to the very name only of our Lord; while martyrdom cannot be consummated
except in the Lord and by the Lord Himself, and therefore nobody can confess Christ without
His name, nor can the name of Christ avail any one for confession without Christ Himself.</p>
<p>12. Wherefore the whole of this discussion must be considered, that it may be made
clearer. For the invocation of the name of Jesus can only be an advantage if it shall be sub-

<pb n="1579"/>
sequently properly supplemented, because both prophets and apostles have so declared. For
James says in the Acts of the Apostles: “Men and brethren, hearken: Simon hath declared
how God at the first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for His name. And to
this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build
again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down; and I will build again the ruins
thereof, and I will raise it up anew; that the residue of men may seek the Lord, and all the
Gentiles, upon whom my name is called upon them, saith the Lord, who doeth these
things.”5460 Therefore also the residue of men, that is, some of the Jews and all the Gentiles
upon whom the name of the Lord is called, may and of necessity must seek the Lord, because
that very invocation of the name affords them the opportunity, or even imposes on them
the necessity, of seeking the Lord. And with these they prescribe the Holy Scriptures—whether
all or only some of them—to discuss still more boldly concerning the truth than with the
Gentiles upon whom the name of the Lord Jesus, the Son of the living God, has not been
invoked, as it likewise has not upon the Jews who only receive the Old Testament Scriptures.
And thus men of both of these kinds, that is, Jews and Gentiles, fully believing as they ought,
are in like manner baptized. But heretics who are already baptized in water in the name of
Jesus Christ must only be baptized with the Holy Spirit; and in Jesus, which is “the only
name given under heaven whereby we must be saved,” death is reasonably despised, although,
if they continue as they are, they cannot be saved, because they have not sought the Lord
after the invocation of His name upon them,—even as those who, on account of false Christs,
perchance have refused to believe, of whom the Lord says, “Take heed that no man lead you
into error. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall lead many into
error.”5461 And again He says: “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo here is Christ, or
lo there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show
great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, even the very elect shall be deceived.”5462
And these miracles, without doubt, they shall then do under the name of Christ; in which
name some even now appear to do certain miracles, and to prophesy falsely. But it is certain
that those, because they are themselves not of Christ, therefore do not belong to Christ, in
like manner as if one should depart from Christ, abiding only in His name, he would not
be much advantaged; nay, rather, he is even burdened by that name, although he may have
been previously very faithful, or very righteous, or honoured with some clerical office, or
endowed with the dignity of confession. For all those, by denying the true Christ, and by
introducing or following another—although there is no other at all—leave themselves no
hope or salvation; not otherwise than they who have denied Christ before men, who must

<pb n="1580"/>
needs be denied by Christ; no consideration for them being made from their previous conversation,
or feeling, or dignity, equally as they themselves have dared to do away with
Christ, that is, their own salvation, they are condemned by the short sentence of this kind,
because it was manifestly said by the Lord, “Whosoever shall deny me before men, I also
will deny him before my Father which is in heaven.” As this word “whosoever,” also in the
sentence of confession, most fully shows us that no condition of the confessor himself can
stand in the way, although he may have been before a denier, or a heretic, or a hearer, or
one who is beginning to hear, who has not yet been baptized or converted from heresy to
the truth of the faith, or one who has departed from the Church and has afterwards returned,
and then when he returned, before the bishop’s hands could be laid upon him, being apprehended,
should be compelled to confess Christ before men; even as to one who again denies
Christ, no special ancient dignity can be effectual to him for salvation.</p>
<p>13. For any one of us will hold it necessary, that whatever is the last thing to be found
in a man in this respect, is that whereby he must be judged, all those things which he has
previously done being wiped away and obliterated.5463 And therefore, although in martyrdom
there is so great a change of things in a moment of time, that in a very rapid case all things
may be changed; let nobody flatter himself who has lost the occasion of a glorious salvation,
if by chance he has excluded himself therefrom by his own fault; even as that wife of Lot,5464
who in a similar manner in time of trouble only, contrary to the angel’s command, looked
behind her, and she became a pillar of salt. On which principle also, that heretic who, by
confessing Christ’s name, is put to death, can subsequently correct nothing, if he should
have thought anything erroneously of God or of Christ, although by believing on another
God or on another Christ he has deceived himself: he is not a confessor of Christ, but in the
name only of Christ; since also the apostle goes on to say, “And if I shall give up my body
so that I may be burnt up with fire, but have not love, I profit nothing.”5465 Because by this
deed he profits nothing who has not the love of that God and Christ who is announced by
the law and the prophets and in the Gospel in this manner: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God, with all thy heart, and with all thy mind, and with all thy thought; and thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself. For on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets;”
5466—even as John the evangelist said, “And every one that loveth is born of God, and
knoweth God; for God is love;”5467 even as God also says, “For God so loved the world, that

He gave His only-begotten Son, that every one that believeth on Him should not perish, but
have everlasting life,”5468—as it manifestly appears that he who has not in him this love, of
loving us and of being loved by us, profits nothing by an empty confession and passion,
except that thereby it appears and is plain that he is a heretic who believes on another God,
or receives another Christ than Him whom the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament
manifestly declare, which announce without any obscurity the Father omnipotent, Creator
of all things, and His Son. For it shall happen to them as to one who expects salvation from
another God. Then, finally, contrary to their notion, they are condemned to eternal punishment
by Christ, the Son of God the Father omnipotent, the Creator whom they have blasphemed,
when God shall begin to judge the hidden things of men according to the Gospel
by Christ Jesus, because they did not believe in Him, although they were washed in His
name.</p>
<p>14. And even to this point the whole of that heretical baptism may be amended, after
the intervention of some space of time, if a man should survive and amend his faith, as our
God, in the Gospel according to Luke, spoke to His disciples, saying, “But I have another
baptism to be baptized with.”5469 Also according to Mark He said, with the same purpose,
to the sons of Zebedee: “Are ye able to drink of the cup which I drink of, or to be baptized
with the baptism wherewith I am baptized?”5470 Because He knew that those men had to
be baptized not only with water, but also in their own blood; so that, as well baptized in this
baptism only, they might attain the sound faith and the simple love of the laver, and, baptized
in both ways, they might in like manner to the same extent attain the baptism of salvation
and glory. For what was said by the Lord, “I have another baptism to be baptized with,”
signifies in this place not a second baptism, as if there were two baptisms, but demonstrates
that there is moreover a baptism of another kind given to us, concurring to the same salvation.
And it was fitting that both these kinds should first of all be initiated and sanctified by our
Lord Himself, so that either one of the two or both kinds might afford to us this one twofold
saving and glorifying baptism; and certain ways of the one baptism might so be laid open
to us, that at times some one of them might be wanting without mischief, even as in the case
of martyrs that hear the word, the baptism of water is wanting without evil; and yet we are
certain that these, if they had any indulgence, would also be used to be baptized with water.
And also to those who are made lawful believers, the baptism of their own blood is wanting
without mischief, because, being baptized in the name of Christ, they have been redeemed
with the most precious blood of the Lord; since both of these rivers of the baptism of the
Lord proceed out of one and the same fountain, that every one who thirsts may come and

<pb n="1582"/>
drink, as says the Scripture, “From his belly flowed rivers of living water;”5471 which rivers
were manifested first of all in the Lord’s passion, when from His side, pierced by the soldier’s
spear, flowed blood and water, so that the one side of the same person emitted two rivers
of a different kind, that whosoever should believe and drink of both rivers might be filled
with the Holy Spirit. For, speaking of these rivers, the Lord set this forth, signifying the Holy
Spirit whom they should receive who should believe on Him: “But the Spirit was not yet
given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.”5472 And when He thus said how baptism might
be produced, which the apostle declares to be one, it is assuredly manifest on that principle
that there are different kinds of one and the same baptism that flow from one wound into
water and blood; since there are there two baptisms of water of which we have spoken, that
is, of one and the same kind,5473 although the baptism of each kind ought to be one, as we
have more fully spoken.</p>
<p>15. And since we seem to have divided all spiritual baptism in a threefold manner, let
us come also to the proof of the statement proposed, that we may not appear to have done
this of our own judgment, and with rashness. For John says of our Lord in his epistle,
teaching us: “This is He who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by water only, but
by water and blood: and it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For
three bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one;”5474—that
we may gather from these words both that water is wont to confer the Spirit, and that men’s
own blood is wont to confer the Spirit, and that the Spirit Himself also is wont to confer the
Spirit. For since water is poured forth even as blood, the Spirit also was poured out by the
Lord upon all who believed. Assuredly both in water, and none the less in their own blood,
and then especially in the Holy Spirit, men may be baptized. For Peter says: “But this is that
which was spoken by the prophet; It shall come to pass in the last days, saith the Lord, I will
pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy, and
their young men shall see visions, and their old men shall dream dreams: and upon my
servants, and upon my handmaidens, will I pour out of my Spirit;”5475—which Spirit we
discover to have been communicated in the Old Testament, not indeed everywhere nor at
large, but with other gifts; or, moreover, to have sprung of His own will into certain men,
or to have invested them, or to have been upon them, even as we observe that it was said by
the Lord to Moses, about the seventy elders, “And I will take of the Spirit which is upon
thee, and will put it upon them.”5476 For which reason also, according to His promise, God

<pb n="1583"/>
put upon them from another of the Spirit which had been upon Moses, and they prophesied
in the camp. And Moses, as a spiritual man, rejoiced that this had so happened, although
he was unwillingly persuaded by Jesus the son of Nave to oppose this thing, and was not
thereby induced. Further, also in the book of Judges, and in the books of Kings too, we observe
that upon several, there either was the Spirit of the Lord, or that He came unto them,
as upon Gothoniel, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, Saul, David, and many others. Which comes
to this result, that the Lord has taught us most plainly by them the liberty and power of the
Holy Spirit, approaching of His own will, saying, “The Spirit breathes where He will; and
thou hearest His voice, and knowest not whence He cometh or whither He goeth.”5477 So
that the same Spirit is, moreover, sometimes found to be upon those who are unworthy of
Him; not certainly in vain or without reason, but for the sake of some needful operation; as
He was upon Saul, upon whom came the Spirit of God, and he prophesied. However, in
later days, after the Spirit of the Lord departed from him, and after a malign spirit from the
Lord vexed him, because then he had come, after the messengers whom he had previously
sent before with care, with intent to kill David; and they therefore fell into the chorus of the
prophets, and they prophesied, so that they neither were able nor willing to do what they
had been bidden. And we believe that the Spirit which was upon them all effected this with
an admirable wisdom, by the will of God. Which Spirit also filled John the Baptist even from
his mother’s womb; and it fell upon those who were with Cornelius the centurion before
they were baptized with water. Thus, cleaving to the baptism of men, the Holy Spirit either
goes before or follows it; or failing the baptism of water, it falls upon those who believe. We
are counselled that either we ought duly to maintain the integrity of baptism, or if by chance
baptism is given by any one in the name of Jesus Christ, we ought to supplement it, guarding
the most holy invocation of the name of Jesus Christ, as we have most abundantly set forth;
guarding, moreover, the custom and authority which so much claim our veneration for so
long a time and for such great men.</p>
<p>16. But since the first part of this argument seems to be unfolded, we ought to touch on
its subsequent part, on account of the heretics; because it is very necessary not to pass over
that discussion which once falls into our hands, lest perchance some heretic should dare,
of his subtlety, to assail those of our brethren who are more simple. For because John said
that we must be baptized in the Holy Ghost and in fire, from the fact that he went on to say
and fire, some desperate men have dared to such an extent to carry their depravity, and
therefore very crafty men seek how they can thus corrupt and violate, and even neutralize
the baptism of holiness. Who derive the origin of their notion from Simon Magus, practising
it with manifold perversity through various errors; to whom Simon Peter, in the Acts of the
Apostles, said, “Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the grace of
<note type="footnote">5477 John iii. 5. [Greek, πνευμα. Syriac as here rendered.]</note>

<pb n="1584"/>
God could be possessed by money; thou hast neither part nor lot in this work; for thy heart
is not right with God.”5478 And such men as these do all these things in the desire to deceive
those who are more simple or more inquisitive. And some of them try to argue that they
only administer a sound and perfect, not as we, a mutilated and curtailed baptism, which
they are in such wise said to designate, that immediately they have descended into the water,
fire at once appears upon the water. Which if it can be effected by any trick, as several tricks
of this kind are affirmed to be—of Anaxilaus—whether it is anything natural, by means of
which this may happen, or whether they think that they behold this, or whether the work
and magical poison of some malignant being can force fire from the water; still they declare
such a deceit and artifice to be a perfect baptism, which if faithful men have been forced to
receive, there will assuredly be no doubt but that they have lost that which they had. Just as,
if a soldier after taking an oath should desert his camp, and in the very different camp of
the enemy should wish to take an oath of a far other kind, it is plain that in this way he is
discharged from his old oath.</p>
<p>17. Moreover, if a man of this sort should again return to thee, thou wilt assuredly hesitate
whether he may have baptism or no; and yet it will behove thee, in whatever way thou
canst, to aid even this man if he repent. For of this adulterous, yea, murderous baptism, if
there is any other author, it is then certainly a book devised by these same heretics on behalf
of this same error, which is inscribed The Preaching of Paul;5479 in which book, contrary to
all Scriptures, thou wilt find both Christ confessing His own sin—although He alone did
no sin at all—and almost compelled by His mother Mary unwillingly to receive John’s
baptism. Also, that when He was baptized, fire was seen to be upon the water, which is
written in neither of the Gospels. And that after such long time, Peter and Paul, after the
collation of the Gospel in Jerusalem, and the mutual consideration and altercation and arrangement
of things to be done finally, were known to one another, as if then for the first
time; and certain other things devised of this kind disgracefully and absurdly;—all which
things thou wilt find gathered together into that book. But they who are not ignorant of the
nature of the Holy Spirit, understand that what is said of fire is said of the Spirit Himself.
For in the Acts of the Apostles, according to that same promise of our Lord, on the very day
of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit had descended upon the disciples, that they might be
baptized in Him, there were seen sitting upon each one tongues as if of fire, that it might
be manifest that they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire—that is, with that
Spirit which was, whether fire, or as fire, such as was the fire which burned in the bush, and
<note type="footnote">5478 Acts viii. 20, 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">5479 Rigaltius says that Jerome mentions this document, and regards it as apocryphal. And Eusebius refers
to the Περίοδοι Πέτρου, which, according to the common reading of Peter for Paul in the text, may point to the

did not consume the bush; and such as is that fire which is the Spirit of the Angel, as saith
the Scripture, “Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a burning fire;”5480 whom
if thou shouldst resemble, or be a companion or sharer with, thou shalt be able to dread no
fire, not even that which, going before the Lord in the day of judgment, shall burn up the
whole world, save those who are baptized in the Holy Spirit and in fire.</p>
<p>18. And the Spirit, indeed, continues to this day invisible to men, as the Lord says, “The
Spirit breathes where He will; and thou knowest not whence He cometh, or whither He
goeth.”5481 But in the beginning of the mystery of the faith and of spiritual baptism, the
same Spirit was manifestly seen to have sat upon the disciples as it had been fire. Moreover,
the heavens being opened, to have descended upon the Lord like a dove; because many
things, yea, almost all things which were to be, are manifest—which, however, were only
invisible nevertheless,—now also are shown to the eyes and to the incredulity of men, either
partially, or at times, or in figure, for the strengthening and confirming of our faith. But
neither should I omit that which the Gospel well announces. For our Lord says to the paralytic
man, “Be of good cheer, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee,”5482 that He might show
that hearts were purified by faith for the forgiveness of sins that should follow. And this
remission of sins that woman also which was a sinner in the city obtained, to whom the
Lord said, “Thy sins are forgiven thee.”5483 And when they who were reclining around
began to say among themselves, “Who is this that forgiveth sins?”5484—because concerning
the paralytic the scribes and Pharisees had murmured crossly—the Lord says to the woman,
“Thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.”5485 From all which things it is shown that
hearts are purified by faith, but that souls are washed by the Spirit; further, also, that bodies
are washed by water, and moreover that by blood we may more readily attain at once to the
rewards of salvation.</p>
<p>19. I think that we have fully followed out the announcement of John the Baptist, whence
we began our discourse, when he said to the Jews, “I indeed baptize you with water unto
repentance; but He who cometh after me is greater than I, whose shoe’s latchet I am not
worthy to unloose: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.”5486 Moreover,
I think also that we have not unsuitably set in order the teaching of the Apostle John, who
says that “three bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three are

one.”5487 And, unless I am mistaken, we have also explained what our Lord says: “John indeed
baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.”5488 Moreover, I think
that we have given no weak reason as the cause of the custom. Let us have a care, although
we do that in a subsequent place, that none may think that we are stirring up the present
debate on a single article; although this custom even alone ought, among men who have the
fear of God, and are lowly, to maintain a chief place.</p>
<note type="footnote">5487 1 John v. 8. [It is noteworthy that he quotes the Latin formula, and not that (εἰς τὸ ἕν εἰσιν) of the Greek.
Now, the Latin, repeating (in verse 8) the formula (hi tres unum sunt) which belongs to the dubious protasis, is
so far evidence that such a verse existed in the old Greek. It is important that the Latin is not conformed to the
received formula of the apodosis, “the three agree in one.”]</note>

<head>Note by the Edinburgh Translator.</head>
<p>Letters of Cyprian to Quintus, to Jubaianus, to Pompey, on “the baptism of heretics;”
and to Magnus on “baptizing the Novatians, and those who obtain grace on a sick-bed,”
may be found translated in Ep. lxx. (p. 377, supra), Ep. lxxii. (p. 379, supra), Ep. lxxiii. (p.
386, supra), and Ep. lxxv. (p. 397, supra), respectively; and the Letter of Firmilian to Cyprian
against the Letter of Stephen, at p. 390, supra, Ep. lxxiv. All these letters are repeated, in extenso,
in the Monumenta Veterum.</p>
<p>Eusebius says, by way of introduction to the fragment of a letter written to Stephen by
Dionysius of Alexandria, as follows: “Dionysius indited to Stephen the first of those letters
which were written on the subject of baptism, when no small controversy had arisen
whether they who are converted from any kind of heresy ought to be purged by baptism
(because an ancient custom had prevailed, that in receiving such there should only be hands
laid upon them, with prayers). Cyprian, who then ruled the Church of Carthage, was the
first who judged that they must not be admitted to communion unless they were first purified
from error by baptism. But Stephen, thinking that nothing should be innovated contrary
to the tradition which had already obtained in that matter from the beginning, was indignant
at this. And as Dionysius had already written many letters to him on this argument, he intimates
to him finally, that all the churches everywhere, now that the fury of persecution
was abated, detesting the turbulent novelty of Novatian,5489 had established peace with one
another.”5490</p>

<head>ANF06. Fathers of the Third Century: Gregory Thaumaturgus,
Dionysius the Great, Julius Africanus, Anatolius, and Minor Writers,
Methodius, Arn by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene Fathers, brings together the
work of early Christian thinkers. In particular, it brings together the writings of the early
Church fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These volumes are noteworthy
for their inclusion of entire texts, and not simply fragments or excerpts from these great
writings. The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and scholars with a good
approximation of the originals. This volume harmonizes various fragmentary material. It
contains the work of different authors: St. Gregory Thaumaturgus, Pope Dionysius of Alexandria,
Sextus Julius Africanus, St. Anatolius, Pope Peter of Alexandria, and others. These
writings were heavily influential on the early Church, and for good reason, as they are inspirational
and encouraging. These volumes also come with many useful notes, providing
the reader with new levels of understanding. Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, or any part of it,
is a welcome addition to one's reading list.</p>

<head>ANF04. Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth;
Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second by
Philip Schaff</head>
<p>Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene Fathers, brings together the
work of early Christian thinkers. In particular, it brings together the writings of the early
Church fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These volumes are noteworthy
for their inclusion of entire texts, and not simply fragments or excerpts from these great
writings. The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and scholars with a good
approximation of the originals. This volume continues with the works of Tertullian, compiling
a series of his shorter treatises. It also contains the work of other Church Fathers from
"Latin Christianity"--Minucius Felix and Commododianus. Finally, it contains some of the
works of well-known and influential theologian Origen. These writings were heavily influential
on the early Church, and for good reason, as they are inspirational and encouraging.
These volumes also come with many useful notes, providing the reader with new levels of
understanding. Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, or any part of it, is a welcome addition to one's
reading list.</p>

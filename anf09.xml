<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids,MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene
Fathers, brings together the work of early Christian thinkers.
In particular, it brings together the writings of the early Church
fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These
volumes are noteworthy for their inclusion of entire texts, and
not simply fragments or excerpts from these great writings.
The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and
scholars with a good approximation of the originals. These
writings were heavily influential on the early Church, and for
good reason, as they are inspirational and encouraging.
These volumes also come with many useful notes, providing
the reader with new levels of understanding. Overall, Ante-
Nicene Fathers, or any part of it, is a welcome addition to
one's reading list.

<p>We Must Adhere to Those Who Cultivate Peace, Not to Those Who Merely 
Pretend to Do So. 421</p>

<p>These Exhortations are Confirmed by the Christian Faith, Which Proclaims the 
Misery of Sinful Conduct. 429</p>

We May Be Blessed. 437</p>
<p>Let Us See by What Means We May Obtain the Divine Blessing. 438</p>
<p>We are Justified Not by Our Own Works, But by Faith. 439</p>
<p>But Let Us Not Give Up the Practice of Good Works and Love. God Himself 
is an Example to Us of Good Works. 440</p>
<p>Great is the Reward of Good Works with God. Joined Together in Harmony, 
Let Us Implore that Reward from Him. 441</p>
<p>Immense is This Reward. How Shall We Obtain It? 442</p>
<p>All Blessings are Given to Us Through Christ. 443</p>
<p>Christ is Our Leader, and We His Soldiers. 444</p>
<p>Let the Members of the Church Submit Themselves, and No One Exalt Himself

<p>Origen's Commentary on the Gospel of John. 538</p>
<p>Book I. 538</p>
<p>How Christians are the Spiritual Israel. 538</p>
<p>The 144,000 Sealed in the Apocalypse are Converts to Christ from the Gentile 
World. 540</p>
<p>In the Spiritual Israel the High-Priests are Those Who Devote Themselves to 
the Study of Scripture. 541</p>

<pb n="ix"/>
<p>The Study of the Gospels is the First Fruits Offered by These Priests of 
Christianity. 542</p>
<p>All Scripture is Gospel; But the Gospels are Distinguished Above Other 
Scriptures. 543</p>
<p>The Fourfold Gospel. John's the First Fruits of the Four. Qualifications 
Necessary for Interpreting It. 545</p>
<p>What Good Things are Announced in the Gospels. 547</p>
<p>How the Gospels Cause the Other Books of Scripture Also to Be Gospel. 549</p>
<p>The Somatic and the Spiritual Gospel. 550</p>
<p>How Jesus Himself is the Gospel. 551</p>
<p>Jesus is All Good Things; Hence the Gospel is Manifold. 553</p>
<p>The Gospel Contains the Ill Deeds Also Which Were Done to Jesus. 555</p>
<p>The Angels Also are Evangelists. 556</p>
<p>The Old Testament, Typified by John, is the Beginning of the Gospel. 557</p>
<p>The Gospel is in the Old Testament, and Indeed in the Whole Universe. 
Prayer for Aid to Understand the Mystical Sense of the Work in Hand. 558</p>
<p>Meaning of “Beginning.” (1) in Space. 559</p>
<p>(2) in Time. The Beginning of Creation. 560</p>
<p>(3) of Substance. 562</p>
<p>(4) of Type and Copy. 563</p>
<p>(5) of Elements and What is Formed from Them. 564</p>
<p>(6) of Design and Execution. 565</p>
<p>The Word Was in the Beginning, I.e., in Wisdom, Which Contained All 
Things in Idea, Before They Existed. Christ's Character as Wisdom is Prior
to His Other Characters. 566</p>
<p>The Title “Word” Is to Be Interpreted by the Same Method as the Other Titles 
of Christ. The Word of God is Not a Mere Attribute of God, But a Separate
Person. What is Meant When He is Called the Word. 569</p>
<p>Christ as Light; How He, and How His Disciples are the Light of the World. 573</p>
<p>Christ as the Resurrection. 576</p>

<p>Christ as a Servant, as the Lamb of God, and as the Man Whom John Did Not

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>The Ante-Nicene Fathers, which seemed many years ago to have completed its task, now
presents itself once more and ventures to solicit the renewal of the favour with which it was
formerly received by the theological world. The publishers and the editor, who now stands,
he well knows how unworthily, in the place of Principal Donaldson and Professor Roberts,
believe that the volume now added to the series will be found most interesting in itself and
not unworthy to stand beside its predecessors.</p>
<p>This volume consists of two distinct parts. The first is a collection of recently discovered
additions to early Christian literature. The period which has elapsed since the last volumes
of this series were published has been singularly rich in such discoveries. A portion of a
gospel has been recovered which was read in the latter part of the second century in certain
Christian churches and purports to be the work of the Apostle Peter. A harmony of the
four canonical gospels has also been brought to our knowledge, which was made in the same
century, and which, in a considerable district of Eastern Christendom, supplanted these
gospels themselves. Another work bearing the name of the Apostle Peter, his Apocalypse,
which once appeared to have some claim to a place in the canon, has also been found. The
Epistles of Clement, which formerly broke off abruptly, have recovered their concluding
portions, and the earliest public appeal to the head of the state on behalf of Christianity is
also now in our possession. The circumstances of these various discoveries, and also of
others of a similar nature, are stated in the introductions prefixed by the writers in this
volume to the various pieces, and it will be seen that scholars of many lands have taken part
in them. English scholarship, it is well known, has distinguished itself highly in this field.
Many of the pieces now given first saw the light in the Cambridge Texts and Studies, a publication
of singular interest and enduring value, without which the present volume would
not have come into existence. The editor of the Texts and Studies, Professor Armitage
Robinson, has taken a very kind interest in the present publication and has himself contributed
translations of two pieces.</p>
<p>The history of the discussions awakened by these discoveries cannot yet be written, but
it is not too early to place the English reader in possession of the documents thus restored
to the Christian community. The reader of former volumes of The Ante-Nicene Fathers has
already become acquainted with a number of uncanonical gospels, of apocalypses, and of
early Christian apologies. In each of these classes of Christian literature he is now presented
with pieces not less interesting than any known before. A glance at the table of contents
will show the principle according to which the various works have been arranged. It may
be stated that the Diatessaron of Tatian is here for the first time translated into English from
the Arabic.</p>

<pb n="3"/>
<p>The second part of this volume contains portions of two of the most important commentaries
of Origen. When The Ante-Nicene Fathers came to a close it was felt that more
should have been done for a father who occupies a position of such singular importance in
the history both of Scripture exegesis and of Christian thought. It is believed that the present
translations will be welcomed by many who feel that growing interest in Origen which now
appears in many quarters, and that they will be acceptable to all who care to know the varieties
of treatment the Scriptures have met with in the church.</p>

<head>The Gospel of Peter.</head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The important fragment of which Mr. J. Armitage Robinson’s translation here follows
was discovered by the French Archæological Mission, Cairo, in a grave (supposed to be a
monk’s) in an ancient cemetery at Akhmîm (Panopolis), in Upper Egypt, in 1886. It was
published in 1892 under the care of M. Bouriant in vol. ix., fasc. i., of the Memoirs of the
French Archæological Mission at Cairo. The same parchment which contained this fragment
also contained a fragment of the Revelation of Peter and a fragment of the Book of Enoch
in Greek. The parchment codex is assigned to a date between the eighth and the twelfth
century.</p>
<p>Before this discovery the following is all that was known of the Gospel of Peter: 1.
Serapion, Bishop of Antioch 190–203, writing to the church at Rhossus, says (Eusebius, H.
E., vi., 12, 2): “We, brethren, receive Peter and the other Apostles even as Christ; but the
writings that go falsely by their names we, in our experience, reject, knowing that such things
as these we never received. When I was with you I supposed you all to be attached to the
right faith; and so without going through the gospel put forward under Peter’s name, I said,
‘If this is all that makes your petty quarrel,1 why then let it be read.’ But now that I have
learned from information given me that their mind was lurking in some hole of heresy, I
will make a point of coming to you again: so, brethren, expect me speedily. Knowing then,
brethren, of what kind of heresy was Marcion—<del>Here follows a sentence where the text is
faulty.</del><gap reason="omitted"/>From others who used this very gospel—I mean from the successors of those who
started it, whom we call Docetæ; for most of its ideas are of their school—from them, I say,
I borrowed it, and was able to go through it, and to find that most of it belonged to the right
teaching of the Saviour, but some things were additions.” From this we learn that a Gospel
of Peter was in use in the church of Rhossus in the end of the second century, but that controversy
had arisen as to its character, which, on a careful examination, Serapion condemned.</p>
<p>2. Origen (<sic>253</sic> a.d.), in commenting on Matthew x. 17, says: “But, proceeding on the
tradition that is recorded in the Gospel according to Peter or in the Book of James, they say
that there are certain brothers of Jesus, the sons of Joseph by a former wife, who lived with
him before Mary.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Παρέχειν μικροψυχίαν, perhaps “causes you ill-feeling.” The translation of Serapion’s letter with this note
is taken from Mr. Armitage Robinson’s edition of the gospel.</note>

<pb n="6"/>
<p>3. Eusebius (H. E., iii., 3, 2) says: “As to that work, however, which is ascribed to him,
called ‘The Acts,’ and ‘The Gospel according to Peter,’ and that called ‘The Preaching and
the Revelations of Peter,’ we know nothing of their being handed down as Catholic writings;
since neither among the ancient nor the ecclesiastical writers of our own day has there been
one that has appealed to testimony taken from them.” And in H. E., iii., 25, 6 sq., he includes
the Gospel of Peter among the forged heretical gospels—“those that are adduced by the
heretics under the name of the apostles,<gap reason="omitted"/>of which no one of those writers in the ecclesiastical
succession has condescended to make any mention in his works; and, indeed, the
character of the style itself is very different from that of the apostles; and the sentiments,
and the purport of those things that are advanced in them, deviating as far as possible from
sound orthodoxy, evidently proves they are the fictions of heretical men; whence they are
not only to be ranked among the spurious writings, but are to be rejected as altogether absurd
and impious.” It is, however, uncertain whether Eusebius himself was acquainted with the
Gospel of Peter.</p>
<p>4. Theodoret (<sic> c. 455</sic>), in his Religious History, ii., 2, says that the Nazarenes used “the
gospel called ‘according to Peter.’” Later references in Western literature, e.g., Jerome, De
vir. ill., i., and the Decretum Gelasianum, condemning the book, are based upon the judgement
of Eusebius, and not upon direct knowledge (cf. Harnack, Geschichte der altchristl.
Lit., I. Th., p. 11).</p>
<p>This was all that was known of the Gospel of Peter till the publication of the Akhmîm
fragment. The latter extends to about 174 stichi, counting 32 words to the stichus. It begins
in the middle of the history of the Passion, just after Pilate has washed his hands of all responsibility,
and ends in the middle of a sentence, with the departure of the disciples into
Galilee at the end of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, exactly a week after the crucifixion, the
ostensible author, Peter, and Andrew, his brother, taking their nets and going to the sea;
“and there was with us Levi the son of Alphæus, whom the Lord<gap reason="omitted"/>”</p>
<p>The accompanying Synoptical Table shows where the Petrine narrative agrees with and
where it varies from those supplied by the canonical gospels. Of that part of the Passion
history which it narrates, it gives an account which follows the main lines of the canonical
tradition, but with important variations in detail. Of the events between the burial and the
resurrection of our Lord, its account is much more ample and detailed than anything in the
canonical tradition.</p>
<p>Harnack (Texte und Untersuchungen, ix., 2, 2d ed., p. 76) gives the following list of new
traits contained in the Petrine account of the history of the Passion and burial:</p>
<p>1. Herod was the judge who condemned Jesus, and to him application had to be made for
the body.</p>
<p>2. The Jews, Herod, and the judges would not wash their hands, and Pilate then raised the
sitting.</p>

<pb n="7"/>
<p>3. Joseph was the friend of Pilate (sec. 2).</p>
<p>4. Joseph begged for the body before the crucifixion, and Pilate sent for permission from
Herod.</p>
<p>5. The soldiers “pushed him as they ran,” and their speech (sec. 3).</p>
<p>6. The mockery of the soldiers.</p>
<p>7. Mocking speech.</p>
<p>8. “As though having no pain” (sec. 4).</p>
<p>9. “Having placed his garments before him.”</p>
<p>10. One of the malefactors blamed the multitude, and his speech.</p>
<p>11. The legs of either the malefactor or Jesus were not broken, in order that he might die in
torment.</p>
<p>12. The gall and vinegar (sec. 5).</p>
<p>13. In the darkness many went about with lamps, and fell down.</p>
<p>14. The cry, “My power, my power.”</p>
<p>15. The fact that when he had so cried Christ was taken up.</p>
<p>16. Mention of the nails in the hands at the taking down from the cross (sec. 6).</p>
<p>17. The earthquake when the body touched the ground.</p>
<p>18. The joy of the Jews when the sun shone again.</p>
<p>19. Joseph “had seen all the good things” that the Lord had done.</p>
<p>20. Joseph washed the body.</p>
<p>21. The cries of woe of the Jews and their leaders over their sins, and their expectation of
the judgement on Jerusalem (sec. 7).</p>
<p>22. The disciples remained in concealment, full of grief, and fasted and wept till the Sabbath.</p>
<p>23. They were searched for as malefactors and as anxious to burn the temple.</p>
<p>24. The name of the centurion of the watch—Petronius (sec. 8).</p>
<p>25. The centurion, the soldiers, and the elders rolled up the stone.</p>
<p>26. The elders also watched at the grave.</p>
<p>27. Seven seals were placed on the stone.</p>
<p>28. A tent pitched for the watch.</p>
<p>29. The gathering of the multitude on the morning of the Sabbath to view the sealed grave
(sec. 9).</p>
<p>The whole narrative of the resurrection is so different from that of the canonical gospels
that it would be useless to go into details; but it is important to notice the prominence assigned
to Mary Magdalene, and:</p>
<p>1. That the women fled from the grave and did not see the Lord (sec. 12).</p>
<p>2. That there is no account of any appearance of Christ for the first eight days after his death
(sec. 13).</p>

<pb n="8"/>
<p>3. That the disciples, along with the rest of those who had taken part in the feast, returned
home to Galilee on the seventh day of unleavened bread.</p>
<p>4. That they were then sad, and wept.</p>
<p>5. That the first appearance of Jesus must have taken place on the Lake of Gennesaret, either
to Peter alone, or to Peter, Andrew, and Levi (Matthew), while fishing.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to section 13 (see sec. 5), the author puts the resurrection and ascension
on the same day, or, rather, did not know of the latter as a separate event. He makes
the angel say, “He is risen and gone away thither whence he was sent.”</p>
<p>Whether the author used any other sources than the canonical gospels is a matter still
in doubt. He is certainly influenced by views which are foreign to these gospels, and which
are known from other quarters in early Christian literature. As between the Synoptists and
the Fourth Gospel, the narrator is generally more closely akin both in matter and in manner
to the Synoptists, but he agrees with the author of the Fourth Gospel in regard to the chronology
of the crucifixion and several of the events at the cross, and in his general attitude
towards the Jews and Pilate. With regard to the last two points, the Petrine Gospel seems
to present a later and more exaggerated form of the tendency perceptible in the Johannine,
and fully worked out in the Acts of Pilate, to blame the Jews and exculpate Pilate.</p>
<p>Of the new features in this fragment some are at least liable to a Docetic interpretation,
e.g., the silence on the cross “as though he had no pain” (sec. 4), the cry, “My power, my
power” (sec. 5), and ”he was taken up” (sec. 5). This fact was recognised in subsequent times
and condemned this gospel in the eye of the church. The date of the work is variously fixed
by different scholars; Harnack assigns it to the first quarter of the second century, while Mr.
Armitage Robinson and other scholars place it later.</p>

<p>1 But of the Jews none washed his hands, neither Herod nor any one of his judges.
And when they had refused to wash them, Pilate rose up. And then Herod the king commandeth
that the Lord be taken,3 saying to them, What things soever I commanded you to
do unto him, do.</p>
<p>2 And there was standing there Joseph the friend of Pilate and of the Lord; and,
knowing that they were about to crucify4 him, he came to Pilate and asked the body of the
Lord for burial. And Pilate sent to Herod and asked his body. And Herod said, Brother
Pilate, even if no one had asked for him, we purposed to bury him, especially as the sabbath
draweth on:5 for it is written in the law, that the sun set not upon one that hath been put
to death.</p>
<p>3 And he delivered him to the people on the day before the unleavened bread, their
feast. And they took the Lord and pushed him as they ran, and said, Let us drag away the
Son of God, having obtained power over him. And they clothed him with purple, and set
him on the seat of judgment, saying, Judge righteously, O king of Israel. And one of them
brought a crown of thorns and put it on the head of the Lord. And others stood and spat
in his eyes, and others smote his cheeks: others pricked him with a reed; and some scourged
him, saying, With this honour let us honour the Son of God.</p>
<p>4 And they brought two malefactors, and they crucified the Lord between them. But
he held his peace, as though having no pain. And when they had raised the cross, they wrote
the title: This is the king of Israel. And having set his garments before him they parted
them among them, and cast lots for them. And one of those malefactors reproached them,
saying, We for the evils that we have done have suffered thus, but this man, who hath become
the Saviour of men, what wrong hath he done to you? And they, being angered at him,
commanded that his legs should not be broken, that he might die in torment.</p>
<p>5 And it was noon, and darkness came over all Judæa: and they were troubled and
distressed, lest the sun had set, whilst he was yet alive: [for] it is written for them, that the
sun set not on him that hath been put to death. And one of them said, Give him to drink

gall with vinegar. And they mixed and gave him to drink, and fulfilled all things, and accomplished
their sins against their own head. And many went about with lamps, supposing that
it was night, and fell down.6 And the Lord cried out, saying, My power, my power, thou
hast forsaken me. And when he had said it he was taken up. And in that hour the vail of
the temple of Jerusalem was rent in twain.7</p>
<p>6 And then they drew out the nails from the hands of the Lord, and laid him upon the
earth, and the whole earth quaked, and great fear arose. Then the sun shone, and it was
found the ninth hour: and the Jews rejoiced, and gave his body to Joseph that he might
bury it, since he had seen what good things he had done. And he took the Lord, and washed
him, and rolled him in a linen cloth, and brought him into his own tomb, which was called
the Garden of Joseph.</p>
<p>7 Then the Jews and the elders and the priests, perceiving what evil they had done to
themselves, began to lament and to say, Woe for our sins: the judgement hath drawn nigh,
and the end of Jerusalem. And I with my companions was grieved; and being wounded in
mind we hid ourselves: for we were being sought for by them as malefactors, and as wishing
to set fire to the temple. And upon all these things we fasted and sat mourning and weeping
night and day until the sabbath.</p>
<p>8 But the scribes and Pharisees and elders being gathered together one with another,
when they heard that all the people murmured and beat their breasts saying, If by his death
these most mighty signs have come to pass, see how righteous he is,—the elders were afraid
and came to Pilate, beseeching him and saying, Give us soldiers, that we may guard his
sepulchre for three days, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and the people suppose
that he is risen from the dead and do us evil. And Pilate gave them Petronius the centurion
with soldiers to guard the tomb. And with them came elders and scribes to the sepulchre,
and having rolled a great stone together with8 the centurion and the soldiers, they all together
who were there set it at the door of the sepulchre; and they affixed seven seals, and they
pitched a tent there and guarded it. And early in the morning as the sabbath was drawing
on, there came a multitude from Jerusalem and the region round about, that they might see
the sepulchre that was sealed.</p>
<p>9 And in the night in which the Lord’s day was drawing on, as the soldiers kept guard
two by two in a watch, there was a great voice in the heaven; and they saw the heavens
opened, and two men descend from thence with great light and approach the tomb. And

<note type="footnote">8 I have ventured to substitute μετὰ, “together with” (cf. Matt. xxvii. 66), for κατὰ, “down upon.” Dr. Swete,

that stone which was put at the door rolled of itself and made way in part; and the tomb was
opened, and both the young men entered in.</p>
<p>10 When therefore those soldiers saw it, they awakened the centurion and the elders;
for they too were hard by keeping guard. And, as they declared what things they had seen,
again they see three men come forth from the tomb, and two of them supporting one, and
a cross following them: and of the two the head reached unto the heaven, but the head of
him that was led by them overpassed the heavens. And they heard a voice from the heavens,
saying, Thou hast preached to them that sleep. And a response was heard from the cross,
Yea.</p>
<p>11 They therefore considered one with another whether to go away and shew these
things to Pilate. And while they yet thought thereon, the heavens again are seen to open,
and a certain man to descend and enter into the sepulchre. When the centurion and they
that were with him saw these things, they hastened in the night to Pilate, leaving the tomb
which they were watching, and declared all things which they had seen, being greatly distressed
and saying, Truly he was the Son of God. Pilate answered and said, I am pure from
the blood of the Son of God: but it was ye who determined this. Then they all drew near
and besought him and entreated him to command the centurion and the soldiers to say
nothing of the things which they had seen: For it is better, say they, for us to be guilty of
the greatest sin before God, and not to fall into the hands of the people of the Jews and to
be stoned. Pilate therefore commanded the centurion and the soldiers to say nothing.</p>
<p>12 And at dawn upon the Lord’s day Mary Magdalen, a disciple of the Lord, fearing
because of the Jews, since they were burning with wrath, had not done at the Lord’s sepulchre
the things which women are wont to do for those that die and for those that are beloved by
them—she took her friends with her and came to the sepulchre where he was laid. And
they feared lest the Jews should see them, and they said, Although on that day on which he
was crucified we could not weep and lament, yet now let us do these things at his sepulchre.
But who shall roll away for us the stone that was laid at the door of the sepulchre, that we
may enter in and sit by him and do the things that are due? For the stone was great, and
we fear lest some one see us. And if we cannot, yet if we but set at the door the things which
we bring for a memorial of him, we will weep and lament, until we come unto our home.</p>
<p>13 And they went and found the tomb opened, and coming near they looked in there;
and they see there a certain young man sitting in the midst of the tomb, beautiful and clothed
in a robe exceeding bright: who said to them, Wherefore are ye come? Whom seek ye?
Him that was crucified?9 He is risen and gone. But if ye believe not, look in and see the
place where he lay, that he is not <del>here</del>; for he is risen and gone thither, whence he was
sent. Then the women feared and fled.</p>

<p>14 Now it was the last day of the unleavened bread, and many were going forth, returning
to their homes, as the feast was ended. But we, the twelve disciples of the Lord, wept and
were grieved: and each one, being grieved for that which was come to pass, departed to his
home. But I Simon Peter and Andrew my brother took our nets and went to the sea; and

<p>31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his

<p>32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they

<p>26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE
JEWS.</p>
<p>27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on
his left.</p>
<p>28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p>

<pb n="17"/>
<p>Luke.</p>
<p>34 ¶ Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they
parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
<p>35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying,
He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
<p>36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p>
<p>37 And saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
<p>38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and
Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p>18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in
the midst.</p>
<p><del>cf. vv. 23, 24.</del></p>
<p>19 ¶ And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF
NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was
nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</p>
<p>Peter.</p>
<p>10 And they brought two malefactors, and they crucified the Lord between them.
But he held his peace, as though having no pain.</p>
<p>11 And when they had raised the cross, they wrote upon it, This is the King of Israel.</p>
<p>12 And having set his garments before him, they parted them among them, and cast
lots for them.</p>
<p><del>cf. v. 11.</del></p>
<p>Matthew.</p>
<p>40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save
thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</p>
<p>41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</p>
<p>42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now
come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</p>
<p>43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am
the Son of God.</p>

<pb n="18"/>
<p><del>cf. v. 35.</del></p>
<p>44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</p>
<p>Mark.</p>
<p>29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou
that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</p>
<p>30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p>
<p>31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He
saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p>32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.</p>
<p><del>cf. v. 24.</del></p>
<p>And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>
<p>Luke.</p>
<p>39 ¶ And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be
Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
<p>40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou
art in the same condemnation?</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p>21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but
that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>
<p>22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</p>
<p>23 ¶ Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made
four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven
from the top throughout.</p>
<p>24 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose
it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among
them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</p>
<p>Peter.</p>
<p><del>cf. v. 12.</del></p>
<p>13 And one of those malefactors reproached him, saying, We for the evils that we have
done have suffered thus, but this man, who hath become the Saviour of men, what wrong
hath he done to you?</p>

<pb n="19"/>
<p>Matthew.</p>
<p>45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</p>
<p>46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama
sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p>Mark.</p>
<p>33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until
the ninth hour.</p>
<p>34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?
which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p>Luke.</p>
<p>41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath
done nothing amiss.</p>
<p>42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>
<p>43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in
paradise.</p>
<p>44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until
the ninth hour.</p>
<p>45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p>25 ¶ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary
the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved,
he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</p>
<p>27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple
took her unto his own home.</p>
<p>Peter.</p>
<p>14 And they, being angered at him, commanded that his legs should not be broken,
that he might die in torment.</p>
<p>15 And it was noon, and darkness came over all Judæa:</p>
<p>and they were troubled and distressed, lest the sun had set, whilst he was yet alive: <del>for</del>
it is written for them, that the sun set not on him that hath been put to death.</p>

<pb n="20"/>
<p>Matthew.</p>
<p>47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for
Elias.</p>
<p>48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and
put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</p>
<p>49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</p>
<p>50 ¶ Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</p>
<p>51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom;
and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</p>
<p>52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</p>
<p>53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and
appeared unto many.</p>
<p>Mark.</p>
<p>35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</p>
<p>36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him
to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</p>
<p>37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p>Luke.</p>
<p>46 ¶ And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I
commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p>28 ¶ After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture
might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</p>
<p>29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and
put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</p>
<p>30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed
his head, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain
upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate
that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</p>
<p>32 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was
crucified with him.</p>

<pb n="21"/>
<p>33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his
legs:</p>
<p>Peter.</p>
<p>16 And one of them said, Give him to drink gall with vinegar. And they mixed and
gave him to drink, 17 and fulfilled all things, and accomplished their sins against their own
head.</p>
<p>18 And many went about with lamps, supposing that it was night, and fell down. 19
And the Lord cried out, saying, My power, my power, thou hast forsaken me.</p>
<p>And when he had said it he was taken up.</p>
<p>20 And in that hour the vail of the temple of Jerusalem was rent in twain.</p>
<p>Matthew.</p>
<p>54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the
earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the
Son of God.</p>
<p>55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee,
ministering unto him:</p>
<p>56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and
the mother of Zebedee’s children.</p>
<p>57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathæa, named Joseph, who
also himself was Jesus’ disciple:</p>
<p>Mark.</p>
<p>39 ¶ And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out,
and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>
<p>40 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene,
and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p>
<p>41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and
many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p>42 ¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day
before the sabbath,</p>
<p>43 Joseph of Arimathæa, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom
of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>Luke.</p>

<pb n="22"/>
<p>47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly
this was a righteous man.</p>
<p>48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were
done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>
<p>49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar
off, beholding these things.</p>
<p>50 ¶ And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good
man, and a just:</p>
<p>51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathæa,
a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p>34 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out
blood and water.</p>
<p>35 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith
true, that ye might believe.</p>
<p>36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him
shall not be broken.</p>
<p>37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
<p>38 ¶ And after this Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear
of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him
leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>Peter.</p>
<p>21 And then they drew out the nails from the hands of the Lord, and laid him upon the
earth, and the whole earth quaked, and great fear arose. 22 Then the sun shone, and it was
found the ninth hour: 23 and the Jews rejoiced, and</p>
<p>Matthew.</p>
<p>58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body
to be delivered.</p>
<p>59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</p>
<p>60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled
a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>
<p>61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</p>

<pb n="23"/>
<p>Mark.</p>
<p>44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion,
he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p>
<p>45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>
<p>46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and
laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of
the sepulchre.</p>
<p>47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p>
<p>Luke.</p>
<p>52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was
hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>
<p>54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>
<p>55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld
the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>
<p>56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day
according to the commandment.</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p>39 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and
brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</p>
<p>40 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as
the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>
<p>41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a
new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</p>
<p>42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day; for the sepulchre
was nigh at hand.</p>
<p>Peter.</p>
<p>gave his body to Joseph that he might bury it,</p>
<p>since he had seen what good things he had done.</p>
<p>24 And he took the Lord, and washed him, and wrapped him in a linen cloth, and
brought him into his own tomb,</p>
<p>which was called the Garden of Joseph.</p>

<pb n="24"/>
<p>25 Then the Jews and the elders and the priests, perceiving what evil they had done to
themselves, began to lament and to say, Woe for our sins: the judgement hath drawn nigh,
and the end of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>26 And I with my companions was grieved; and being wounded in mind we hid
ourselves: for we were being sought for by them as malefactors, and as wishing to set fire
to the temple.</p>
<p>Matthew.</p>
<p><del>1cf. Mt. ix. 15.</del></p>
<p>62 ¶ Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and
Pharisees</p>
<p>came together unto Pilate,</p>
<p>63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three
days I will rise again.</p>
<p>64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his
disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the
dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>
<p>65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</p>
<p>66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</p>

these most mighty signs have come to pass, see how just he is,—29 the elders were afraid
and</p>
<p>came to Pilate, beseeching him and saying, 30 Give us soldiers, that we may guard his
sepulchre for three days, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and the people suppose
that he is risen from the dead and do us evil.</p>
<p>31 And Pilate gave them Petronius the centurion with soldiers to guard the tomb. And
with them came the elders and scribes to the sepulchre,</p>
<p>32 And having rolled a great stone together with the centurion and the soldiers, they
all together who were there set it at the door of the sepulchre;</p>
<p>33 And they affixed seven seals, and they pitched a tent there and guarded it.</p>
<p>34 And early in the morning as the sabbath was drawing on, there came a multitude
from Jerusalem and the region round about, that they might see the sepulchre that was
sealed.</p>
<p>35 And in the night in which the Lord’s day was drawing on, as the soldiers kept guard
two by two in a watch, there was a great voice in the heaven; 36 and they saw the heavens
opened, and two men descend from thence with great light and approach the tomb. 37
And that stone which was put at the door rolled of itself and made way in part; and the tomb
was opened, and both the young men entered in.</p>
<p>38 When therefore those soldiers saw it, they awakened the centurion and the elders,—
for they too were hard by keeping guard; 39 and, as they declared what things they
had seen, again they see three men coming forth from the tomb, and two of them supporting
one, and a cross following them. 40 And of the two the head reached unto the heaven, but
the head of him that was led by them overpassed the heavens. 41 And they heard a voice
from the heavens, saying, Hast thou preached to them that sleep? 42 And a response was
heard from the cross, Yea.</p>
<p>43 They therefore considered one with another whether to go away and shew these
things to Pilate. 44 And while they yet thought thereon, the heavens again are seen to open,
and a certain man to descend and enter into the sepulchre. 45 When the centurion and
they that were with him saw these things, they hastened in the night to Pilate, leaving the
tomb which they were watching, and declared all things which they had seen, being greatly
distressed and saying, Truly he was the Son of God.</p>

<p>Chapter XXVIII.</p>

<pb n="26"/>
<p>1 ¶ In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</p>
<p>2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from
heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</p>
<p>3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</p>
<p>Mark.</p>
<p>Chapter XVI.</p>
<p>1 ¶ And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James,
and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</p>
<p>2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre
at the rising of the sun.</p>
<p>3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of
the sepulchre?</p>
<p>4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</p>
<p>5 And entering into the sepulchre,</p>
<p>they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and
they were affrighted.</p>
<p>Luke.</p>
<p>Chapter XXIV.</p>
<p>1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the
sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</p>
<p>2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>
<p>3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood
by them in shining garments:</p>
<p>5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them,
Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p>Chapter XX.</p>
<p>1 ¶ The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto
the sepulchre,</p>
<p>and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</p>

<pb n="27"/>
<p>Peter.</p>
<p>46 Pilate answered and said, I am pure from the blood of the Son of God: but ye determined
this.</p>
<p>47 Then they all drew near and besought him and entreated him to command the
centurion and the soldiers to say nothing of the things which they had seen: 48 For it is
better, say they, for us to incur the greatest sin before God, and not to fall into the hands of
the people of the Jews and to be stoned. 49 Pilate therefore commanded the centurion and
the soldiers to say nothing.</p>
<p>50 And at dawn upon the Lord’s day, Mary Magdalen, a disciple of the Lord, fearing
because of the Jews, since they were burning with wrath, had not done at the Lord’s sepulchre
the things which the women are wont to do for those that die and for those that are beloved
by them—</p>
<p>51 she took her friends with her and came to the sepulchre where he was laid.</p>
<p>52 And they feared lest the Jews should see them, and they said, Although on the day
on which he was crucified we could not weep and lament, yet now let us do these things at
his sepulchre.</p>
<p>53 But who shall roll away for us the stone that was laid at the door of the sepulchre,
that we may enter in and sit by him and do the things that are due? 54 For the stone was
great, and we fear lest some one see us. And if we cannot, yet if we but set at the door the
things which we bring for a memorial of him, we will weep and lament, until we come unto
our home.</p>
<p>55 And they went away and found the tomb opened,</p>
<p>and coming near they looked in there;</p>
<p>and they see there a certain young man sitting in the midst of the tomb, beautiful and
clothed in a robe exceeding bright;</p>
<p>Matthew.</p>
<p>4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</p>
<p>5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye
seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>
<p>6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>
<p>7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he
goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>
<p>8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run
to bring his disciples word.</p>

<pb n="28"/>
<p>Mark.</p>
<p>6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was
crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</p>
<p>7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee:
there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</p>
<p>8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were
amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</p>
<p><del>Levi, etc.; cf. Mk. ii. 14.</del></p>
<p>Luke.</p>
<p>6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in
Galilee,</p>
<p>7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified,
and the third day rise again.</p>
<p>8 And they remembered his words,</p>
<p>9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all
the rest.</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p>Peter.</p>
<p>who said unto them, 56 Wherefore are ye come? Whom seek ye? Him that was crucified?
He is risen and gone. But if ye believe not, look in and see the place where he lay, that
he is not [here]; for he is risen and gone away thither, whence he was sent.</p>
<p>57 Then the women feared and fled.</p>
<p>58 Now it was the last day of the unleavened bread, and many were going forth, returning
to their homes, as the feast was ended. 59 But we, the twelve disciples of the Lord, mourned
and were grieved: and each one, being grieved for that which was come to pass, departed
to his home. 60 But I, Simon Peter and Andrew my brother, took our nets and went to the
sea; and there was with us Levi the son of Alphæus, whom the Lord<gap reason="omitted"/></p>

<head>THE DIATESSARON OF TATIAN
By
REV. HOPE W. HOGG, B.D.</head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction_1">
<pb n="30"/>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The aim of the following introductory paragraphs is neither to furnish a detailed restatement
of facts already known, nor to offer an independent contribution to the discussion of
the problems that arise, although in other circumstances such an attempt might be made
with advantage. All that is needed and practicable here is to describe briefly, if possible, the
nature of the connection between the English treatise forming the next part of this volume
and the ancient work known as the Diatessaron of Tatian; and then to indicate in a few
words some of the more important or interesting features of the work itself, and some of
the historical and other problems that are in one way or another connected with it.</p>
<p>1 The Text Translated.—What is offered to the reader is a translation into English of
an Arabic text, published at Rome in 1888, in a volume entitled in Arabic Diatessaron, which
Titianus Compiled from the Four Gospels, with the alternative Latin title, Tatiani Evangeliorum
Harmoniæ, Arabice. The Roman volume consists of two parts—the text, covering a little
over 209 very clearly printed Arabic pages, and a Latin half, comprising a scholarly introduction
(pp. v.–xv.), a Latin translation (pp. 1–99), and a table showing the order in which
the passages taken from the gospels occur in the text. The editor is P. Agostino Ciasca, a
well known Orientalist, “scriptor” at the Vatican Library.</p>
<p>2 Former Translations.—In his Introduction (p. xiv. f.) Ciasca explains that in his
translation he aimed at preserving quantum, salva fidelitate, integrum fuit, indolem stylumque
Clementinæ Vulgate. This Latin version was in its turn translated into English by the Rev.
J. Hamlyn Hill, B.D., and published in 1894 in a volume entitled The Earliest Life of Christ,
with an interesting introduction and a number of valuable appendices. The ms. of Mr. Hill’s
translation of the Latin of Ciasca was compared with the Arabic original by Mr. G. Buchanan
Gray, M.A., lecturer in Hebrew and the Old Testament in Mansfield College, Oxford.</p>
<p>3 The Present Translation.—The translation offered here is quite independent of either
of these two. Ciasca’s Latin was seldom consulted, except when it was thought the Arabic
might perhaps be obscured by a misprint. After the translation was completed, Hill’s English
was compared with it to transfer Mr. Hill’s valuable system of references to the margin of
this work, and to lessen the risk of oversights passing the last revision unnoticed. In two or
three cases this process led to the adoption of a different construction, and in a few of the
more awkward passages a word was borrowed as being less harsh than that which had originally
been written. Speaking generally, the present version appears to differ from Mr.
Hill’s in adhering more closely to the original.17</p>

<pb n="31"/>
<p>4 The Arabic Text.—Only two Arabic mss. are known to exist. Ciasca tells us (p. xiv.)
that he took as the basis of his text that ms. which is more careful in its orthography, the
Cod. Vat. Arab. No. 14. He, however, printed at the foot of the page the variants of the
other ms., and supplied from it two lacunæ in the Cod. Vat.,18 substituted its readings for
those of the Cod. Vat. where he thought them preferable, and followed its testimony in
omitting two important passages.19 Here and there Ciasca has emended the text, but he
does not profess to have produced a critical edition.20</p>
<p>5 The Arabic mss.—Unfortunately, the present writer has not had an opportunity of
examining these two mss.; but they have been described at some length by Ciasca; Codex
XIV. in Pitra’s Analecta Sacra, iv., 465 ff., and the other codex in the volume with which we
are dealing, p. vi. ff. I. The former, which we shall call the Vatican ms. (in Ciasca’s footnotes
it is called A), was brought to the Vatican from the East by Joseph S. Assemani21 about a.d.
1719. It was described by Stephen E. Assemani,22 Rosenmüller, and Akerblad,23 and then
at length by Ciasca, to whose account the reader must be referred for the details. It consists
of 123 folios, of which the first seven are somewhat spoiled, and of which two are missing,24
and is supposed by Ciasca, from the character of the writing, and from the presence of certain
Coptic letters25 by the first hand, to have been written in Egypt. S. Assemani assigned it to
the twelfth century, and Ciasca accepts his verdict, while Akerblad says the thirteenth or
fourteenth century. The text of the ms. is pretty fully vocalised, but there are few diacritical
points. There are marginal notes, some of them by a later hand,26 which Ciasca classifies
as (1) emendations, (2) restorations, (3) explanations. II. The second ms., which we shall
call the Borgian (in Ciasca’s footnotes it is called B), was brought to the Borgian Museum
from Egypt in August, 1886. It has at the end the following inscription in Arabic: “A present
from Halim Dos Ghali, the Copt, the Catholic, to the Apostolic See, in the year of Christ
1886.”27 Antonius Morcos, Visitor Apostolic of the Catholic Copts, when, in the beginning
of 1886, he was shown and informed about the Vatican ms., told of this other one and was
the means of its being sent to Rome. The Borgian ms., which Ciasca refers to the fourteenth

century, consists of 355 folios. Folios 1–8528 contain an anonymous preface on the gospels,
briefly described by Ciasca, who, however, does not say whether it appears to have been
originally written in Arabic or to have been translated into that language. With folios 96b,
97a, which are reproduced in phototype in Ciasca’s edition, begins the Introductory Note
given in full at the beginning of the present translation. The text of the Diatessaron ends
on folio 353a, but is followed by certain appendices, for which see below, §55, 17, note.
This ms. is complete, and has, as we shall see,29 in some respects a better text, though it is
worse in its orthography than the Vatican ms.</p>
<p>6 Condition of the Arabic Text.—Ciasca’s text does not profess to be critically determined,
for which purpose a more careful study of each of the mss. and an estimate of their respective
texts would be indispensable. Although the Borgian ms. is supposed by Ciasca to be a century
or two later than the Vatican ms. it is clearly not a copy of the latter, for not only does it
sometimes offer more original readings, but, as we shall see, its text in some points coincides
more exactly in scope with the original work. The list of various readings supplied by
Ciasca,30 which is equal to about a fifth or a quarter of the text itself, ought to yield, on being
analysed, some canons of criticism. The footnotes of the present edition are enough to show
that a number of the peculiar features of Ciasca’s text do not belong to the original Arabic
ms.; and further study would dispose of still more. On the other hand, there are unfortunately
some indications31 that the common ancestor of both mss., though perhaps less than two
centuries removed from the original, was not the original itself, and therefore emendation
may be necessary even where both mss. agree. From first to last it has to be borne in mind
that a great deal of work was done at Arabic versions of the gospels,32 and the text of the
copy from which our two mss. are descended may already have suffered from contact with
other versions; while the special activity of the thirteenth century may have left its mark in
some places on the text of the Borgian ms., supposing it to be chronologically the later.</p>
<p>7 Origin of the Arabic Text.—If some of the uncouthness of the Arabic text is due to
corruption in the course of transmission, much is also due to its being not an original work,
but a translation. That it is, in the main, a translation from Syriac is too obvious to need
proof.33 The Introductory Notice and Subscription to the Borgian ms., moreover, expressly

state that the work was translated by one Abu’l Faraj ‘Abdulla ibn-at-Tayyib,34 an “excellent
and learned priest,” and the inferiority of parts of the translation,35 and entire absence of
any confirmatory evidence,36 hardly suffice to refute this assertion. Still, the Borgian ms.
is a late witness, and although it most probably preserves a genuine tradition as to the author
of our work, its statement need not therefore necessarily be correct in every point.</p>
<p>8 The Arabic Editor and his Method.—Ibn-at-Tayyib (d. 1043) is a well known man, a
Nestorian monk and scholar, secretary to Elias I., Patriarch of Nisibis (for references to
sources see, e.g., Ciasca’s Introduction, p. xi. f. and Steinschneider’s long note in his Polemische
und apologetische Lit. in Arabische Sprache, pp. 52–55). As we are here concerned with
him simply as a link in the chain connecting our present work with its original source, the
only point of interest for us is the method he followed in producing it. Did he prepare an
independent translation or did he make use of existing Arabic versions, his own or others’?
Until this question which space forbids us to discuss here, has been more thoroughly investigated,
37 it must suffice to say that in view of the features in the present text that have not
yet been shown to exist in any other Arabic version, it is still at least a tenable hypothesis
that Ibn-at-Tayyib’s ms. constituted to a considerable extent a real translation rather than
a sort of Arabic parallel to the Codex Fuldensis (see below, 12).</p>
<p>9 The Syriac Text Translated—The eleventh century ms. of Ibn-at-Tayyib, could we
reach it, would bring us face to face with the more interesting question of the nature of his
Syriac original. The Subscription to the Borgian ms. states, probably copying the statement
from its exemplar, that this was a. Syriac ms. in the handwriting of ‘Isa ibn-‘Ali al

<note type="footnote">35 See a glaring case in § 52, 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">36 The references to the readings of the Diatessaron in Ibn-at-Tayyib’s own commentary on the gospels (see

<note type="footnote">37 A specially important part of the general question is this, What are the mutual relations of the following:
(1) a supposed version of at least Matthew and John made from the Syriac by Ibn-at-Tayyib, mentioned by Ibnal-‘
Assal in the Preface to his scholarly recension of the gospels (ms. numbered Or. 3382 in Brit. Mus., folio
384b) and used by him in determining his text; (2) the gospel text interwoven with the commentary of Ibn-at-
Tayyib on the gospels, a commentary which De Slane says the author wrote in Syriac and then translated into
Arabic; (3) our present work. Of mss. testifying to No. 1 we have some dating from the time of Ibn-al-‘Assal
himself; of No. 2 we have, in addition to others, an eleventh-century ms. in Paris, described by De Slane (catalogue
No. 85) as being “un volume dépareillé du ms. original de l’ouvrage”; of No. 3 we have of course the Vatican
and Borgian mss. What is the mutual relation of these texts; were any two of them identical? The Brit. Mus.
ms. of the second has many points of contact with the third, but is dated 1805 a.d. Does the older Paris ms.
stand more or less closely related? Did Ibn-at-Tayyib himself really translate any or all of these texts, or did he
simply select or edit them? Space does not permit us to point out, far less to discuss, the various possibilities.</note>

Motatabbib, pupil of Honain ibn Ishak. This Honain was a famous Arabic physician and
medical writer of Bagdad (d. 873), whose school produced quite a number of translations
and translators, among whom Ibn-‘Ali, supposed to be identical with the Syriac lexicographer
of the same name, is known to have had a high place. The Syriac ms., therefore, that Ibnat-
Tayyib translated takes us back to about the year 900. But the Subscription to each of
our mss.38 states that the work ended is the gospel called Diatessaron, compiled from the
four gospels by Titianus; while the Introductory Note to the Borgian ms. adds that this
Titianus was a Greek. The next step, therefore, is to inquire whether any traces exist of such
a Syriac work, or any statements by which we can check the account just given of it.</p>
<p>10 Other Traces of a Syriac Text.—No copy of a Syriac Diatessaron has yet been shown
to have survived.39 A number of quotations40 from such a work have, however, been found
in a Syriac commentary on the New Testament by Isho‘dad of Merv (circ. 852), a contemporary
of Honain, Ibn-‘Ali’s teacher.41 The value of these extracts is apparent, for they take
us back one generation earlier than Ibn-at-Tayyib’s Syriac exemplar. More important still,
they do not entirely agree with the text of our Arabic version. To solve the problem thus
raised, we must examine some of the statements about the Diatessaron to be found in ecclesiastical
writers.</p>
<p>11 Statements about the Diatessaron.—One of the most widely known is that of Isho‘dad
himself, who, in his Preface to the Gospel of Mark, says: “Tatian, disciple of Justin, the
philosopher and martyr, selected from the four gospels, and combined and composed a
gospel, and called it Diatessaron, i.e., the Combined,…and upon this gospel Mar Ephraem
commented.”42 Dionysius Bar Salibi (twelfth century) repeats each of these phrases, adding,
<note type="footnote">38 The text is given below in full at its proper place.</note>
<note type="footnote">39 Prof. Gottheil, indeed, announced in 1892 in the Journal of Biblical Literature (vol. xi., pt. i., p. 71) that he
had been privately informed of the existence of a complete copy of the Syriac Diatessaron. Unfortunately,
however, as he has kindly informed me, he has reluctantly come to the conclusion that the ms. in question,
which is not yet accessible, is “nothing more than the commentary of Isho‘dad” mentioned in the text. A similar
rumor lately circulated probably originated simply in the pamphlet of Goussen mentioned in the next note. S.
Bäumer, on the other hand, in his article, “Tatians Diatessaron, seine bisher. Lit. u. die Reconstruction des
Textes nach einer neuentdeckten Handschrift” (Literarischer Handweiser, 1890, 153–169) which the present
writer has not been able to see, perhaps refers simply to the Borgian ms.</note>

“Its commencement was, ‘In the beginning was the Word.’”43 These statements identify
the author of the Diatessaron with a man otherwise known, and tell us that the great Syrian
father Ephraem (d. 373) wrote a commentary on it. Unfortunately, no Syriac ms. of Ephraem’s
work is known to have survived;44 but quotations from it, or allusions to it, are being
found in other Syriac writers. One further reference will suffice for the present. Theodoret,
Bishop of Cyrrhus, four hundred years before Isho‘dad, wrote thus in his book on Heresies
(written in 453): “Tatian the Syrian.…This <del>writer</del> also composed the gospel which is called
Diatessaron, cutting out the genealogies and whatever other passages show that the Lord
was born of the seed of David according to the flesh.”45 Before examining the testimonials
we have now adduced, we must notice certain more remote sources of information.</p>
<p>12 Non-Syriac Texts of the Diatessaron.—Although Ephraem’s Syriac commentary on
the Diatessaron is for the present lost, there is an Armenian version of it46 extant in two
mss. dating from about the time of Bar Salibi and our Vat. ms.47 A Latin translation of this
work, published in 1876 by Moesinger,48 formed the main basis of Zahn’s attempt49 to reconstruct
the Diatessaron. Appendix X in Hill’s Diatessaron (pp. 334–377) contains an
English translation of the texts commented on by Ephraem, made from Moesinger’s Latin,
but collated with the Armenian by Professor J. Armitage Robinson, of Cambridge. A comparison
of this document with our Arabic text shows a remarkable agreement in the order
and contents, but just as remarkable a lack of agreement in the kind of text presented. The
same phenomenon is met with when we compare our Arabic text with a document that
carries us back three hundred years before the time of Isho‘dad, and therefore more than
six hundred years before the Armenian mss.—the Codex Fuldensis of the Vulgate.50 This
ms. contains an arrangement of the gospel matter that its discoverer and publisher, Bishop
Victor of Capua (d. 554), rightly concluded must represent the Diatessaron of Tatian, but

for the text of which was apparently substituted that of the Vulgate.51 We are now ready
to weigh the testimony we have gathered.52</p>
<p>13 Accretions to the Diatessaron.—The statements we are to consider are: (1) Bar
Salibi’s, that Tatian’s Diatessaron began with “In the beginning was the Word”;53 (2)
Theodoret’s, that Tatian cut out the genealogies; and (3) the same writer’s, that Tatian also
cut out “whatever other passages show that the Lord was born of the seed of David according
to the flesh.” Of these statements 1 conflicts with the Arabic text, which begins with Mark,
and the Codex Fuldensis, which begins with Luke, but agrees with the Ephraem source; the
same is true of 2; while 3 conflicts with all three texts. Our limits do not admit of our discussing
these points in detail. It must suffice to say (1) that, although a more careful examination
at firsthand of the introductory notices in the two Arabic mss. seems needed before
one can venture to propound a complete theory, a comparison of the two texts, and a consideration
of the descriptions given by Ciasca and Lagarde,54 make it almost certain that
the genuine Arabic text of Ibn-at-Tayyib began with John i. 1. Similarly the first four verses
of Luke (on which see also below, § 1. 6, note) were probably not in the original text of the
ms. that Victor found, for they are not mentioned in the (old) table of contents. We seem
thus to detect a process of gradual accretion of material drawn from the ordinary gospel
text. (2) The genealogies illustrate the same process. In the Vatican ms. they form part of
the text.55 But in the Borgian ms., although they precede the Subscription, and therefore
may have been already in the ninth century Syriac ms. used by Ibn-at-Tayyib, they are still
placed by themselves, after a blank space, at the end of the volume, with a title of their own.56
Here, therefore, we actually see stages of the process of accretion. (3) It is therefore possible
that the same account must also be given of 3, although in this case we have no direct proof.</p>
<p>14 Passages Lost from the Diatessaron.—If the Diatessaron has thus been growing so
as to represent the ordinary text of the canonical gospels more completely, we have also
evidence that suggests that it has been at some time or times purged of certain features that
are lacking in these canonical gospels. For one case of this kind see below, §4, 36, note.</p>

<p>15 Presentation of the Text of the Diatessaron.—We have observed already that the
Latin, Armenian, and Arabic Diatessarons correspond pretty closely in subject matter and
arrangement, but differ markedly in text. The Codex Fuldensis is really a ms. of the Vulgate,
although the text that Victor found was probably somewhat different. The Armenian text
differs materially from the ordinary Syriac version of the New Testament (the Peshitta),
showing a marked connection with another type of Syriac text represented now by the
Curetonian and Sinaitic (Lewis) mss. The Arabic text, on the other hand, almost systematically
represents the Peshitta. The explanation of the condition of text in the Codex
Fuldensis is obvious. On the other hand, the relationship of the Armenian and Arabic texts
to the original Diatessaron must be determined by weighing very multifarious evidence that
cannot be even cited here (see above 6 ff.). The two texts depend, as we have seen, on late
mss. but all the earlier references and quotations go to show that the Armenian text57 stands
much more closely related to the original than does the Arabic.</p>
<p>16 Checkered History of the Diatessaron.—What use the Arabic edition of Ibn-at-
Tayyib was put to when made we do not know. ‘Abd Isho‘ (d. 1318) speaks in the highest
terms of Tatian’s work, saying, “<gap reason=" omitted"/>With all diligence he attended to the utmost degree to
the right order of those things which were said and done by the Saviour; of his own he did
not add a single saying.”58 But the leaders of the Syrian church had not always thought so.
Theodoret (loc. cit.) some nine hundred years earlier had written thus: “<gap reason=" omitted"/>Even those that
follow the apostolic doctrines, not perceiving the mischief of the composition,” used “the
book too simply as an abridgment.” A few years earlier Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa (d. 435),
had said:59 “Let the presbyters and deacons give heed that in all the churches there be
provided and read a copy of the Distinct Gospel,” i.e., not the harmonized or mixed gospel.
But obviously these men were trying to suppress traditional practice due to very different
views. Theodoret (loc. cit.) found more than two hundred copies of the work “held in respect
in the churches”; and the Doctrine of Addai (Edessa, third to fourth century) seems simply
to identify the Diatessaron and the New Testament.60 Outside of the Syriac speaking churches
we find no signs of any such use of the Diatessaron. It would seem, therefore, that at a quite
early stage the Diatessaron was very widely if not universally read in the Syriac churches,
and commented on by scholars as the gospel; that in time it fell under the condemnation
of some at least of the church leaders, who made violent efforts to suppress it; that it could
not be suppressed; that a commentary on it was (perhaps in the fifth century61) translated

into Armenian; that it was still discussed by commentators, and new Syriac mss. of it made
in the ninth century, and thought worth the labor of reproduction in Arabic in the beginning
of the eleventh century; that mss. of the Armenian volume continued to be made down to
the very end of the twelfth century, and of the Arabic edition down to the fourteenth century;
but that this long life was secured at the expense of a more or less rapid assimilation of the
text to that of the great Syriac Bible which from the fourth century onwards became more
and more exclusively used—the Peshitta.</p>
<p>17 The Author of the Diatessaron.—The Diatessaron is such an impersonal work that
we do not need to know very much about its compiler.62 It will suffice here to say that he
tells us himself that he was born “in the land of the Assyrians,” and brought up a heathen.
After travelling in search of knowledge, he settled at Rome, where he became a pupil of
Justin Martyr, professed Christianity, and wrote in Greek his Address to the Greeks,63
translated in vol. iii. of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library. He was too independent in his
attitude to maintain a permanent popularity, and after Justin’s death left Rome and returned
to Mesopotamia. It was probably here that he issued in Syriac his most important work,
the Diatessaron, which won such a warm place in the heart of the Syrian church. Among
the Greek scholars, however, he became more and more regarded as a heretic, Encratite
(ascetic), and Gnostic.</p>
<p>18 The Diatessaron as a Harmony.—Not very much need be said on this subject, as
every reader can collect the facts for himself. In its present form the Harmony draws from
all the four canonical gospels, and from very little else. Opinions differ as to whether it
originally indicated the gospel from which any given piece was drawn, and some uncertainty
must remain in special cases as to what gospel actually has been drawn upon. Professor G.
F. Moore, in a very interesting article on the Diatessaron,64 having counted the references
in the Arabic mss., states that the Arabic text contains 50 percent of Mark, 66 percent of
Luke, 76.5 percent of Matthew, and 96 percent of John. The summation of his figures gives
the following result: out of a total of 3780 verses in the four gospels, the Diatessaron quotes
2769 and omits 1011. As to the order in which the whole is arranged, Moore thinks that
Matthew has chiefly been followed; while Zahn regards the Fourth Gospel as normative.
For a specimen of the way in which words and phrases from the different gospels are woven
together, we may refer to § 52, 35 ff., and the notes thereon. In the Arabic mss., and probably
in the Syriac exemplar, the work is divided into fifty-four almost equal chapters, followed

by one short one—a feature that agrees well with what we have learned of the work as being
of old the lectionary of the Syrian church.</p>
<p>19 Problems Connected with the Diatessaron.—The Diatessaron opens up a very wide
field of study. A few points may be here enumerated (see also above, 8, and note there). In
what language was it written? On the view favoured by an increasing majority of scholars,
that it was written in Syriac, was it a translation or simply a compilation? What precisely
is its relation to the Syriac versions and the “Western” text generally? Then there is its
bearing on the date and formation of the canonical gospels; the phenomenon of its so long
supplying the place of those gospels; the analogy it presents to the Pentateuch, according
to the critical view of the origin of the latter. These and other issues make the Diatessaron
an important and interesting study.</p>
<p>20 The Present Translation.—The work of translation has been found much more tedious
than was anticipated, notwithstanding the fact that considerably more than half of it is the
work of my wife, which I have simply revised with special attention to the many obscurities
dealt with in the footnotes. We have, however, worked so much together that it is very
doubtful whether any one could assign the various parts to their respective sources. My
wife also verified the Arabic references to the gospels printed on the margin to the right of
the text,65 and prepared the Index to these references—an extremely laborious and perplexing
piece of work. This Index is inserted merely for the practical purpose of enabling the reader
to find any given gospel piece in the Diatessaron. When a verse is not found in the Index,
an equivalent passage from some of the other gospels should be looked for. On the margin
to the left of the text are indicated the pages of the Arabic text and the sections and verses
in Hill’s version.66</p>
<p>The aim has been to make a literal translation. As two freer translations already exist,
it seemed best to incline to the side of being overliteral. If, however, features due simply to
Arabic idiom have been preserved, this is an oversight. Uniformity could only have been
secured by devoting a much longer time to the work than the editor was able to allow. The
difficulties are due to the corrupt state of the Arabic text,67 and to the awkward reproduc-
<note type="footnote">65 The refs., except where the foot-notes indicate otherwise, are to the verses of the English or Greek Bible.
The numbers of the Arabic verse refs. (which follow the Vulgate and therefore in one or two passages differ
from the English numbers by one) may, however, have been occasionally retained through oversight. It is only
the name of the gospel that can possibly be ancient.</note>
<note type="footnote">66 It may be mentioned that it has been found very convenient to mark these figures on the margin of the
Arabic text. An English index (that given here, or that in Hill’s volume) can then be used for the Arabic text
also.</note>

tion68 or actual misunderstanding69 of the Syriac original by the author or authors of the
Arabic translation. It has been impossible to maintain consistency in dealing with these
phenomena. If any rendering seem strange, it will be well to consult the Syriac versions
before deciding that it is wrong. A good deal of attention, too, has to be paid to the usage
of the Arabic text, which, though it has many points of contact with other Arabic versions
of the gospels, e.g., the ms. described by Gildemeister (De evangg. in arab. e simp. Syr., 1865),
is as yet for us (see above, 8) a distinct version, possessed of an individuality of its own, one
pronounced feature being its very close adherence to its Syriac original. Another revision
of the present translation, in the light of a fuller study of these features, would doubtless
lead to changes both in the text and in the footnotes. The latter aim at preventing misunderstanding
and giving some examples of the peculiarities of the text, and of the differences
between the mss. To have dealt systematically with the text and various readings would
have required much more time and space than was available. The consequence of this incompleteness
has been some uncertainty at times what text to translate. As already stated
(paragraphs 4 and 6), Ciasca’s printed text neither represents any one ms. nor professes to
be based in its eclecticism on any systematic critical principles. On the whole Ciasca has
here been followed somewhat mechanically in deciding what to exhibit in the text and what
to relegate to the footnotes. As a rule conjectural emendations have not been admitted into
the text except where the ms. readings would hardly bear translation. Italics in the text denote
words supplied for the sake of English idiom; in the footnotes, quotations from the mss. It
is to be noted that many linguistic usages said, for shortness, in the footnotes to be characteristic
of the present work, i.e., as compared with ordinary Arabic, are common in Arabic
versions. “Syriac versions” means the three (Pesh., Cur., Sin.), or as many of them as contain
the passage in question; if the Peshitta alone is quoted, it may be assumed that Cur. and Sin.
are missing or diverge.</p>
<p>In conclusion we may say that an effort has been made to preserve even the order of
words; but it must be emphasized that it is very doubtful whether it is wise for any one to
use the Arabic Diatessaron for critical purposes who is not acquainted with Arabic and
Syriac. The tenses, e.g., are much vaguer in Arabic than in Greek and English, and are,
moreover, in this work often accommodated to Syriac idiom. The Greek and the Revised
Version have been used to determine in almost every case how the vague Arabic tenses and
conjunctions should be rendered. It is therefore only where it differs from these that our
translation can be quoted without investigation as giving positive evidence.</p>
<p>This is not a final translation. Few books have had a more remarkable literary history
than the Diatessaron, and that history is by no means done. Much careful argument will

yet be devoted to it, and perhaps discoveries as important as any hitherto made are yet to
shed light on the problems that encircle it. If our work can help any one to take a step in
advance, we shall not regret the toil.</p>

<p>In the name of the one God, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, to him be the
glory forever. We shall begin, with the help of God most high, the writing of the pure gospel,
the blooming garden, called Diatessaron (a word meaning “fourfold”), the work compiled
by Titianus the Greek out of the four evangelists—Matthew the elect, whose symbol is M,
Mark the chosen, whose symbol is R, Luke the approved, whose symbol is K, and John the
beloved, whose symbol is H. The work was translated from Syriac into Arabic by the excellent
and learned priest Abu’l Faraj ‘Abdulla ibn-at-Tayyib,70 may God grant him his favour. He
began with the first of71 And he said: The Beginning72 of the Gospel of Jesus the Son of the

according to the Brit. Mus. ms.), although not in the gospel text prefixed to the Comments as it now stands, or
indeed in any ms. Arabic gospel in the Brit. Mus. This would seem to militate against our theory of the original
form of this much-debated passage in the Introductory Notes, as indicated by the use of small type for the later
inserted phrases; and the difficulty appears at first to be increased by the following words in Ibn-at-Tayyib’s

which Tatianus the pupil of Justianus the philosopher wrote, the quotation is not written, “Isaiah,” but, “as it is
written in the prophet.” This is a remarkable statement about the Diatessaron. But the sentence is hardly
grammatical. Perhaps the words printed in italics originally formed a complete sentence by themselves, possibly
on the margin. If this conjecture be correct we might emend, e.g., by restoring them to the margin, and repeating
the last three words or some equivalent phrase in the text. It would be interesting to know how the Paris ms.

<p><del>1</del> <del>Arabic, p. 7</del> 173Now174 the birth of Jesus the Messiah was on this wise: In the time
when his mother was given in marriage to Joseph, before they came together, <del>2</del> she was
found with child of the Holy Spirit. 175And Joseph her husband was a just man and did not
wish to expose her, and he purposed to put her away secretly. <del>3</del> 176But when he thought
of this, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, and said unto him, Joseph, son
of David, fear not to take Mary thy wife, for that <del>4</del> which is begotten177 in her is of the
Holy Spirit. 178She shall bear a son, and thou shalt <del>5</del> call his name Jesus, and he shall
save179 his people from their sins. 180And all this was that the saying from the Lord by the
prophet might be fulfilled:</p>
<p><del>6</del> 181Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,</p>
<p>And they shall call his name Immanuel,</p>

<note type="footnote">174 This is preceded in Vat. ms. by the genealogy, Matt. i. 1–17 (see Introduction, 13), with the marginal note
The Beginning of the Gospel of Matthew. (Lagarde, op. cit., 1886, p. 154.) The text presents nothing worthy of
note in this place except that verse 16, construed on the same principle as the preceding verses, to which, except
in the words printed in italics, it is strictly parallel in construction, reads thus: “Jacob begat Joseph, the husband
of Mary, who of her begat Jesus, the Messiah” (cf. the remarkable reading of Sin. Syriac). As it stands, this is the
only possible interpretation of the words, for who is masculine. But a mistake in the gender of a relative pronoun
is very common in Arabic among illiterate people, while in Syriac there is, to begin with, no distinction. If then
we correct the relative, who of her will become of whom (fem.), and begat will of course be construed as passive.
We thus get the text followed in Ibn-at-Tayyib’s Commentary, the ordinary reading of the Peshitta, of whom
was born Jesus.</note>

this word has been used by the Vat. ms. in the sense of begat. Here the Borg. ms. has of her for in her; but Ibnat-

that he hate one of them and love the other, and honour one of them and despise the <del>2</del>
other. 754Ye cannot serve God and possessions. And because of this I say unto you, Be not
anxious for yourselves,755 what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink; neither for your bodies,
what ye shall put on. Is not the life better than the food, and the body <del>3</del> than the raiment?
756Consider the birds of the heaven, which sow not, nor reap, nor store in barns; and yet
your Father which is in heaven feedeth them. Are not ye <del>4</del> better than they? 757Who of
you when he trieth is able to add to his stature one <del>5</del> cubit? 758If then ye are not able for
a small thing, why are ye anxious about the <del>6, 7</del> rest? 759Consider the wild lily, how it
grows, although it toils not, nor spins; 760and I say unto you that Solomon in the greatness
of his glory was not clothed like one of <del>8</del> them. 761And if God so clothe the grass of the
field, which to-day is, and to-morrow <del>9</del> is cast762 into the oven, how much more shall be
unto you, O ye of little faith! 763Be not anxious, so as to say, What shall we eat? or, What
shall we drink? or, With <del>10</del> what shall we be clothed? 764Neither let your minds be perplexed
in this: 765all these things the nations of the world seek; and your Father which is in
heaven knoweth <del>11</del> your need of all these things. 766Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
and his righteousness; <del>12</del> [Arabic, p. 39] and all these shall come to you as something additional

is a greater than Jonah. 1150The unclean spirit, when he goeth out of the man, departeth,
and goeth about through places wherein are no waters, that he may find rest for himself;
and when he findeth it not, he <del>8</del> saith, I will return to my house whence I came out.
1151And if he come and find it <del>9</del> adorned and set in order, 1152then he goeth, and associateth

<p><del>1</del> 1266At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, and all the things
which came to pass at his hand; 1267and he marvelled, for he had obtained excellent <del>2</del> information
concerning him.1268 1269And some men said that John the Baptist was risen <del>3</del>
from among the dead; 1270and1271 others said that Elijah had appeared; and others,
Jeremiah; <del>4</del> and others, that a prophet of the old prophets was risen; 1272and others said
that he <del>5</del> was a prophet like one of the prophets. 1273Herod said to his servants, This is
John the Baptist, he whom I beheaded; he is risen from among the dead: therefore mighty
<del>6</del> [Arabic, p. 70] works result from him. 1274For Herod himself had sent and taken John,
and cast him into prison, for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, whom he <del>7</del>
had taken. 1275And John said to Herod, Thou hast no authority to take the wife of thy <del>8</del>
brother. 1276And Herodias avoided him and wished to kill him; and she could not. <del>9</del>
1277But Herod feared John, for he knew that he was a righteous man and a holy; and <del>10</del>
he guarded him, and heard him much, and did, and obeyed him with gladness. 1278And
he wished to kill him; but he feared the people, for they adhered to him as the <del>11</del> prophet.
1279And there was a celebrated day, and Herod had made a feast for his great men on the
day of his anniversary,1280 and for the officers and for the chief men <del>12</del> of Galilee. 1281And

the Father. 1385Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever believeth in me hath eternal <del>42,
43</del> life. 1386I am the bread of life. 1387Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and
<del>44</del> they died. 1388This is the bread which came down from heaven, that a man may eat
<del>45</del> of it, and not die. 1389I am the bread of life which came down from heaven: and if a
man eat of this bread he shall live for ever: 1390and the bread which I shall give is my body,
which I give for the life of the world.</p>
<p><del>46</del> 1391The Jews therefore quarrelled one with another, and said, How can he give us
<del>47</del> <del>Arabic, p. 77</del> his body that we may eat it? 1392Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, If ye do not eat the body of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye shall <del>48</del>
not have life in yourselves. 1393Whosoever eateth of my body and drinketh of my blood
<del>49</del> hath eternal life; and I will raise him up in the last day. 1394My body truly is meat,1395
and <del>50</del> my blood truly is drink.1396 1397Whosoever eateth my body and drinketh my
blood abideth <del>51</del> in me, and I in him—1398as the living Father sent me, and I am alive
because of the <del>52</del> Father; and whosoever eateth me, he also shall live because of me.
1399This is the bread which came down from heaven: and not according as your fathers ate
the <del>53</del> manna, and died: whosoever eateth of this bread shall live for ever. 1400This he
said in <del>54</del> the synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum. 1401And many of his

<del>2</del> that, and he said unto them, Doth this trouble you? 1403What if ye should see the Son
<del>3</del> of man then ascend to the place where he was of old? 1404It is the spirit that quickeneth,
and the body profiteth nothing: the words1405 that I speak unto you are spirit <del>4</del> and life.
1406But there are some of you that do not believe. And Jesus knew beforehand who they
were who should1407 not believe, and who it was that should betray <del>5</del> him. 1408And he
said unto them, Therefore I said unto you, No man can come unto me, if that hath not been
given him by the Father.</p>
<p><del>6</del> <del>Arabic, p. 78</del> 1409And because of this word many of his disciples turned back and

go away? 1411Simon Cephas answered and said, My Lord, to whom shall we go? thou <del>9</del>
hast the words of eternal life. 1412And we have believed and known that thou art the <del>10</del>
Messiah, the Son of the living God. 1413Jesus said unto them, Did not I choose you, <del>11</del> ye
company of the twelve, and of you one is a devil? 1414He said that because of Judas the son
of Simon Iscariot; for he, being of the twelve, was purposed to1415 betray him.</p>
<p><del>12</del> 1416And while he was speaking, one of the Pharisees came asking of him that he
<del>13</del> would eat with him: and he went in, and reclined to meat. 1417And that Pharisee, when

man from without cannot defile him; 1456because it entereth not into his heart; it entereth
into his stomach only, and thence is cast forth in the cleansing which maketh <del>41</del> clean all
the food?1457 1458The thing which goeth forth from the mouth of the man proceedeth <del>42</del>
from his heart, and it is that which defileth the man. 1459From within1460 the <del>43</del> heart of
men proceed evil thoughts, 1461fornication, adultery, theft, false witness, murder, injustice,
wickedness, deceit, stupidity, evil eye, calumny, pride, foolishness: <del>44</del> 1462these evils all

answered and said unto them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take thy

repentance. 1816I say unto you, Thus there shall be rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that

<p><del>40</del> 1921And when Jesus was teaching on the sabbath day in one of the synagogues,
<del>41</del> there was there a woman that had a spirit of disease eighteen years; 1922and she was
<del>42</del> bowed down, and could not straighten herself at all. 1923And Jesus saw her, and called
<del>43</del> her, and said unto her, Woman, be loosed from thy disease. 1924And he put his hand
<del>44</del> upon her; and immediately she was straightened, and praised God. 1925And the chief1926
of the synagogue answered with anger, because Jesus had healed on a sabbath, and said
unto the multitudes, There are six days in which work ought to be done; <del>45</del> come in them
and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. 1927But Jesus answered and said unto him, Ye
hypocrites, doth not each of you on the sabbath day loose <del>46</del> his ox or his ass from the
manger, and go and water it? 1928Ought not this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham,
and whom the devil1929 hath bound eighteen years, <del>47</del> to be loosed from this bond on the
sabbath day? 1930And when he said this, they were all put to shame, those standing, who
were opposing him:1931 and all the people were pleased with all the wonders that proceeded

near. 1934So the brethren of Jesus said unto him, Remove now hence, and go to Judæa, that
<del>3</del> thy disciples may see the deeds that thou doest. 1935 For no man doeth a thing secretly
<del>4</del> and wisheth to be apparent. 1936If thou doest this, shew thyself to the world. For <del>5</del>
up to this time not even the brethren of Jesus believed on him. 1937Jesus said unto them,
My time till now has not arrived; but as for you, your time is alway ready. <del>6</del> 1938It is not
possible for the world to hate you; but me it hateth, for I bear witness <del>7</del> against it, that its
deeds are evil. 1939As for you, go ye up unto this feast: but I go <del>8</del> not up now to this feast;
for my time has not yet been completed. 1940He said this, and remained behind in Galilee.</p>
<p><del>9</del> 1941But when his brethren went up unto the feast, he journeyed from Galilee, and
<del>10</del> came to the borders of Judæa, to the country beyond Jordan; 1942and there came after
<del>11</del> him great multitudes, and he healed them all there. 1943And he went out, and proceeded
<del>12</del> to the feast, not openly, but as one that conceals himself. 1944And the Jews sought him
<del>13</del> at the feast, and said, In what place is this man? 1945And there occurred much murmuring
there in the great multitude that came to the feast, on his account. For <del>14</del> some said,
He is good: and others said, Nay, but he leadeth the people astray. 1946But no man spake
of him openly for fear of the Jews.</p>

Jesus went <del>16</del> up to the temple, and taught. 1948And the Jews wondered, and said, How
doth <del>17</del> this man know writing,1949 seeing he hath not learned? 1950Jesus answered and
said, My doctrine1951 <del>18</del> is not mine, but his that sent me. 1952Whoever wisheth to do
his will understandeth my doctrine,1953 whether it be from God, or whether I speak of mine

law? 1956Why seek ye to kill me? The multitude answered and said unto him, Thou <del>22</del>
hast demons:1957 who seeketh to kill thee? 1958Jesus answered and said unto them, I did

(not because it is from Moses, but it is from the fathers); and ye on the sabbath <del>24</del> circumcise
a man. 1960And if a man is circumcised on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may
not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I healed on the sabbath <del>25</del> day the whole man?

known whence he is; and the Messiah, when he cometh, no man knoweth whence <del>29</del> he

do, since I have no place to store my produce? 1975And he said, I will do this: I will pull
down the buildings of my barns, and build them, and make <del>39</del> them greater; and store
there all my wheat and my goods. 1976And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods
laid by for many years; take thine ease, eat, <del>40</del> drink, enjoy thyself. 1977God said unto him,

<p><del>1</del> 2054And he spake a parable unto those which were bidden there, because he saw <del>2</del>
them choose the places that were in the highest part of the sitting room: 2055When a man
invites thee to a feast, do not go and sit at the head of the room; lest there <del>3</del> be there a man
more honourable than thou, 2056and he that invited you come and say unto thee, Give the
place to this man: and thou be ashamed when thou risest and <del>4</del> takest2057 another place.
2058But when thou art invited, go and sit last; so that when he that invited thee cometh, he
may say unto thee, My friend, go up higher: and <del>5</del> thou shalt have praise before all that
were invited with thee. 2059For every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and every
one that abaseth himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p><del>6</del> 2060And he said also to him that had invited him, When thou makest a feast2061 or
a banquet,2062 do not invite thy friends, nor even thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy
<del>7</del> rich neighbours; lest haply they also invite thee, and thou have this reward. 2063But
when thou makest a feast, invite the poor, and those with withered hand, and the <del>8</del> lame,
and the blind: 2064and blessed art thou, since they have not the means to reward <del>9</del> thee;
that thy reward may be at the rising of the righteous. 2065And when one of them that were
invited heard that, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of
God.</p>

time of the feast to inform them that were invited, 2071Everything is made ready for you;
come. And <del>13</del> they would not come, but began all of them with one voice to make excuse.
2072And the first said unto them, Say to him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out
<del>14</del> to see it: 2073I pray thee to release2074 me, for I ask to be excused. And another said,
I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to examine them: I pray thee <del>15</del> to release
me, for I ask to be excused. 2075And another said, I have married a wife, <del>16</del> and therefore
I cannot come. 2076And the king sent also other servants, and said, Say to those that were
invited, that my feast is ready, and my oxen and my fatlings are <del>17</del> slain, and everything
is ready: come to the feast. 2077But they made light of it, and <del>18</del> went, one to his field,

out quickly into the markets and into the partings of the ways of the city, and bring in
hither the poor, and those with pains, and the lame, and the blind. And the servants did as

feast. <del>26</del> 2087And those servants went out into the roads, and gathered all that they found,
good and <del>27</del> bad: and the banquet-house was filled with guests. 2088And the king entered
to see those <del>28</del> who were seated, and he saw there a man not wearing a festive garment:
2089and he said unto him, My friend, how didst thou come in here not having on festive
garments? <del>29</del> 2090And he was silent. Then the king said to the servants, Bind his hands

<p><del>31</del> 2092And after that, the time of the feast of unleavened bread of the Jews arrived,
<del>32</del> and Jesus went out to go to Jerusalem. 2093And as he went in the way, there met him

<del>34</del> said, Our Master, Jesus, have mercy upon us. 2095And when he saw them, he said unto
them, Go and shew yourselves unto the priests. And when they went, they <del>35</del> were
cleansed. 2096And one of them, when he saw himself cleansed, returned, and <del>36</del> was
praising God with a loud voice; 2097and he fell on his face before the feet of <del>37</del> Jesus, giving
him thanks: and this man was a Samaritan. 2098Jesus answered and said, <del>38</del> Were not

to come and praise God, but this man who is of a strange <del>39</del> people. 2100He said unto

<p><del>1</del> 2183And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, he went up to the temple of God, and found
<del>2</del> there oxen and sheep and doves. 2184And when he beheld those that sold and those that
bought, and the money-changers sitting, 2185he made for himself a scourge of rope, and
drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and the money-changers;
2186and he threw down their money, and upset their tables, and the seats of <del>3</del> them that
sold the doves; 2187and he was teaching, and saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
is a house of prayer for all peoples? and ye have made it a den <del>4</del> for robbers. 2188And he
said unto those that sold the doves, Take this hence, and <del>5</del> make not my Father’s house a
house of merchandise. 2189And he suffered not any <del>6</del> one to carry vessels inside the
temple. 2190And his disciples remembered the scripture, <del>7</del> The zeal of thy house hath
eaten me up. 2191The Jews answered and said unto him, <del>8</del> What sign hast thou shewn us,
that thou doest this? 2192Jesus answered and said unto <del>9</del> them, Destroy this temple, and
I shall raise it in three days. 2193The Jews said unto him, This temple was built in forty-six
years, and wilt thou raise it in three days? <del>10</del> 2194But he spake unto them of the temple
of his body, that when2195 they destroyed it, he <del>11</del> <del>Arabic, p. 122</del> would raise it in three

Pharisee stood apart,2205 and prayed thus, O Lord, I thank thee, since I am not like the rest
of men, the unjust, the profligate, the extortioners, or even like this publican; <del>19</del> 2206but
I fast two days a week, and tithe all my possessions.2207 2208And the publican was <del>20</del>
standing at a distance, and he would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but was <del>21</del> beating
upon his breast, and saying, O Lord, have mercy on me, me the sinner. 2209I say unto you,

unto him, My Master, we know that thou hast been sent from God as a teacher; and no man
can do these signs that thou doest, except him whom God is <del>29</del> with. 2219Jesus answered

old be born? can he, think you, return again to <del>31</del> his mother’s womb a second time, to
enter and be born? 2221Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, If
a man be not born of water and the Spirit, <del>32</del> he cannot enter the kingdom of God. 2222For
he that is born of flesh is flesh; and he that <del>33</del> is born of Spirit is spirit. 2223Wonder not

he and his <del>2</del> disciples. 2242And as they passed in the morning, the disciples saw that fig
tree <del>3</del> withered away from its root. 2243And they passed by, and said, How did the fig tree
dry <del>4</del> up immediately? 2244And Simon remembered, and said unto him, My Master, behold,
<del>5</del> that fig tree which thou didst curse hath dried up. 2245And Jesus answered and said <del>6</del>
unto them, Let there be in you the faith of God. 2246Verily I say unto you, if ye believe, and
doubt not in your hearts, and assure yourselves that that will be which <del>7</del> ye say, ye shall
have what ye say. 2247And if ye say to this mountain, Remove, and <del>8</del> fall2248 into the sea,

2250And the apostles2251 said unto our Lord, Increase our2252 faith. 2253He said unto them,
If there be in you faith like a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this fig tree, Be thou torn up,

thou shalt eat and drink also. <del>13</del> 2257Doth that servant haply, who did what he was bid,

not God still more do vengeance for his elect, who call upon him in the night <del>25</del> and in

<del>Arabic, p. 128</del> they did likewise with them. 2300So the owner of the vineyard said, What
shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will see him and be <del>49, 50</del> ashamed.

<del>2</del> and deliver him into the power of the judge,2316 and into the power of the ruler. 2317And
they sent unto him their disciples, with the kinsfolk of Herod; and they said unto him, <del>Arabic,
p. 129</del> Teacher, we know that thou speakest the truth, and teachest the way of God
with equity,2318 and art not lifted up2319 by any man: for thou actest not so as to <del>3</del> be seen
of any man. 2320Tell us now, What is thy opinion? Is it lawful that we should <del>4</del> pay the
tribute to Cæsar, or not? shall we give, or shall we not give? 2321But Jesus knew <del>5</del> their
deceit, and said unto them, 2322Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Shew me the <del>6</del> penny
of the tribute. 2323So they brought unto him a penny. Jesus said unto them, To whom belongeth
this image and inscription? They said unto him, To Cæsar. <del>7, 8</del> 2324He said unto
them, Give what is Cæsar’s to Cæsar, and what is God’s to God. 2325And they could not
make him slip in a single word before the people; and they marvelled at his word, and refrained.</p>
<p><del>9</del> 2326And on that day came the Sadducees, and said unto him,2327 There is no life for
<del>10</del> the dead. 2328And they asked him, and said unto him, Teacher, Moses said unto us, If
a man die, not having children, let his brother take his wife, and raise up seed <del>11</del> for his
brother. 2329Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first took a wife, <del>12</del> and died
without children; 2330and the second took his wife, and died without children; <del>13</del> 2331and

without leaving children. 2332And last of them all the woman died also. 2333At the resurrection,
then, which of these seven shall have this woman? for all of them took <del>16</del> her.
2334Jesus answered and said unto them, Is it not for this that ye have erred, <del>17</del> because ye
know not the scriptures, nor the power of God? 2335And the sons of this <del>18</del> world take
wives, and the women become the men’s;2336 2337but those that have become worthy of
that world, and the resurrection from among the dead, do2338 not take <del>19</del> <del>Arabic, p. 130</del>
wives, and the women also do2339 not become the men’s. 2340Nor is it possible that they
should die; but they2341 are like the angels, and are the children of <del>20</del> God, because they
have become the children of the resurrection. 2342For in2343 the resurrection of the dead,

<del>27</del> in the law? 2351Jesus said unto him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O <del>28</del>
Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one: 2352and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy thought, and with all thy <del>29, 30</del> strength.

it, is, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. And another commandment <del>31</del> greater

answered and said unto him, Thou art not far from the <del>35, 36</del> kingdom of God. 2361Thou
hast spoken rightly: do this, and thou shalt live. 2362And he, as his desire was to justify

<del>54, 55</del> 2587Jesus said unto them, Is not the day of twelve hours? If then a man walk in the
day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of the world. 2588But if <del>56</del> a man walk
in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no lamp in him. 2589This said Jesus: and after
that, he said unto them, Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep; but <del>57</del> I am going to awaken
him. 2590His disciples said unto him, Our Lord, if he hath <del>58</del> fallen asleep, he will recover.</p>
<p>2591But Jesus said that concerning his death: while they <del>59</del> supposed that he spake of lying
down to sleep. 2592Then Jesus said unto them plainly, <del>60</del> Lazarus is dead. 2593And I am
glad that I was not there for your sakes, that ye may <del>61</del> believe; but let us go thither.</p>

<p><del>1, 2</del> 2596And Jesus came to Bethany, and found him already four days in the grave.
2597And Bethany was beside Jerusalem, and its distance from it was a sum of fifteen furlongs;
2598 <del>3</del> 2599and many of the Jews came unto Mary and Martha, to comfort their heart
<del>4</del> because of their brother. 2600And Martha, when she heard that Jesus had come, went
<del>5</del> out to meet him: but Mary was sitting in the house. 2601Martha then said unto Jesus,
<del>6</del> My Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 2602But I know now that,
<del>7</del> whatever thou shalt ask of God, he will give thee. 2603Jesus said unto her, Thy brother
shall <del>8</del> rise. 2604Martha said unto him, I know that he shall rise in the resurrection at the
last day. <del>9</del> 2605Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: whosoever believeth
in <del>10</del> <del>Arabic, p. 144</del> me, even though he die, he shall live: 2606and every living one that
believeth <del>11</del> in me shall never die.Believest thou this? 2607She said unto him, Yea, my
Lord: I believe that thou art the Messiah, the Son of God, that cometh into the <del>12</del> world.</p>
<p>2608And when she had said that, she went and called Mary her sister secretly, <del>13</del> and said
unto her, Our Master hath come, and summoneth thee. 2609And Mary, when <del>14</del> she heard,
rose in haste, and came unto him. 2610(And Jesus then had not come into <del>15</del> the village,
but was in the place where Martha met him.) 2611And the Jews also that were with her in
the house, to comfort her, when they saw that Mary rose up and went out in haste, went
after her, because they supposed that she was going to the <del>16</del> tomb to weep. 2612And

Mary, when she came to where Jesus was, and saw him, fell at his feet, and said unto him,
If thou hadst been here, my Lord, my brother had <del>17</del> not died. 2613And Jesus came; and
when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were <del>18</del> with her weeping, he was troubled2614
in himself, and sighed; and he said, 2615In what <del>19</del> place have ye laid him? And they said
unto him, Our Lord, come and see. 2616And <del>20</del> the tears of Jesus came.2617 2618The Jews
therefore said, See the greatness of his love for <del>21</del> him! 2619But some of them said, Could
not this man, who opened the eyes of that <del>22</del> blind man, have caused that this man also
should not die? 2620And Jesus came to the place of burial, being troubled within himself.
And the place of burial was a cave, <del>23</del> and a stone was placed at its door. 2621Jesus therefore
said, Take these stones away. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto him, My
Lord, he hath come to <del>24</del> stink for some time: he hath been2622 four days dead. 2623Jesus
said unto her, Did not I say <del>25</del> <del>Arabic, p. 145</del> unto thee, If thou believest, thou shalt see
the glory of God? 2624And they removed those stones. And Jesus lifted his eyes on high,
and said, My Father, <del>26</del> I thank thee since thou didst hear me. 2625And I know that thou
at all times hearest me: but I say this unto thee because of this multitude that is standing,
that they <del>27</del> may believe that thou didst send me. 2626And when he had said that, he cried
with a <del>28</del> loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 2627And that dead man came out, having his
hands and feet bound with bandages, and his face wrapped in a scarf. Jesus said unto them,
Loose him, and let him go.</p>

know that after two days will be the passover, and the Son of man is delivered up to be <del>3</del>
crucified. 3020Then gathered together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders <del>4</del>
of the people, unto the court of the chief priest, who was called Caiaphas; 3021and they took
counsel together concerning Jesus, that they might seize him by subtilty, and <del>5</del> kill him.
3022But they said, Not during the feast, lest there take place a disturbance among the people;

to the last he loved them. 3034And at the time of the feast, Satan put into the <del>13</del> heart of
Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to deliver him up. 3035And Jesus, because he knew that
the Father had delivered into his hands everything, and that he came <del>14</del> forth from the
Father, and goeth unto God, 3036rose from supper, and laid aside his <del>15</del> garments; 3037and
took a towel, and girded his waist, and poured water into a bason, and began to wash the

<p>3038And when he came to Simon Cephas, Simon said unto <del>17</del> him, Dost thou, my Lord,
wash for me my feet? 3039Jesus answered and said unto <del>18</del> him, What I do, now thou
knowest not; but afterwards thou shalt learn. 3040Simon said unto him, Thou shalt never
wash for me my feet. Jesus said unto him, If I <del>19</del> wash thee not, thou hast no part with
me. 3041Simon Cephas said unto him, Then, my <del>20</del> Lord, wash not for me my feet alone,
but my hands also and my head. 3042Jesus said unto him, He that batheth3043 needeth not
to wash save his feet, whereas his whole <del>21</del> body is clean: and ye also are clean, but not all

and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will <del>2</del> shew
myself unto him. 3166Judas (not Iscariot) said unto him, My Lord, what is the <del>3</del> purpose

unto him, Whosoever loveth me will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and to

said to Cephas, This is our Lord. And Simon, when he heard that it was our Lord, took his
tunic, and girded it on his waist (for he was <del>32</del> naked), and cast himself into the sea to
come to Jesus. 3826But some others of the disciples came in the boat3827 (and they were not

<head>The Revelation of Peter.</head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The fragment here translated was discovered in 1886 by the French Archæological
Mission in an ancient burying place at Akhmîm in Upper Egypt. It was published at Paris
in 1892 (Bouriant, Mémoires publiés par les membres de la Mission Archéologique Française
au Caire, T. ix., fasc. 1, 1892). The ms. is now in the Gizeh Museum and has been held to
be of a date between the eighth and twelfth centuries. Until the discovery of the fragment,
the following was all that was known about the Revelation of Peter.</p>
<p>1. The so-called Muratorian Fragment, a list of sacred writings, first published by
Muratori in 1740, and found by him in a seventh or eighth century ms. belonging to the
Ambrosian Library in Milan, but which had previously belonged to the Columban Monastery
of Bobbio, is assigned on internal evidence to the third quarter of the second century. (Vide
Westcott, Canon of the N.T., p. 514.) At line 69 it says: “the Apocalypses also of John and
Peter only do we receive, which (latter) some among us would not have read in church.”</p>
<p>2. Clement of Alexandria (fl. c. 200 a.d.) in his Hypotoposes, according to the testimony
of Eusebius, H. E., vi., 14, gave “abridged accounts of all the canonical Scriptures, not even
omitting those that are disputed, I mean the book of Jude and the other general epistles.
Also the Epistle of Barnabas and that called the Revelation of Peter.” Also in his Eclogæ
Prophetiæ, chapters 41, 48 and 49, he gives three, or as some think, four quotations from
the Revelation of Peter, mentioning it twice by name.</p>
<p>3. The Catalogus Claromontanus, an Eastern list of Holy Scriptures, belonging to the
third century, gives at the end the Revelation of Peter (v. Westcott, Canon, p. 555). This
catalogue gives the length of the various books it enumerates measured in stichoi. Our book
is said to have two hundred and seventy, which makes it rather longer than the Epistle to
the Colossians which has two hundred and fifty-one.</p>
<p>4. Methodius, bishop of Olympus in Lycia in the beginning of the fourth century, in
his Symposium, ii., 6, says, “wherefore we have also learned from divinely inspired Scriptures
that untimely births even if they are the offspring of adultery are delivered to caretaking
angels.” Though Peter is not here mentioned, the purport of the passage is the same as that
of one of the quotations given by Clement of Alexandria.</p>
<p>5. Eusebius (<sic> c.</sic> 339 a.d.), in his Ecclesiastical History, iii., 25, expressly mentions the
Revelation of Peter along with the Acts of Paul and the Pastor as spurious books, while at
iii., 3, he says: “as to that which is called the Preaching and that called the Apocalypse of
<pb n="300"/>
Peter, we know nothing of their being handed down as Catholic writings. Since neither
among the ancients nor among the ecclesiastical writers of our own day, has there been
anyone that has appealed to testimony taken from them.”</p>
<p>6. Macarius Magnes (beginning of fifth century) in his Apocritica, iv., 6, quotes as from
a heathen opponent of Christianity the following: “Let us by way of superfluity cite also
that saying in the Apocalypse of Peter. It thus introduces the heaven as being about to undergo
judgment along with the earth. ‘The earth,’ it says, ‘shall present all men before God
at the day of judgment, being itself also to be judged along with the heaven also which encompasses
it.’” And at iv., 16, he examines this passage again, naming the revelation of
Peter, and supporting the doctrine of the passage by the authority of prophecy (Isaiah xxxiv.
4) and the Gospel (Matt. xxiv. 35).</p>
<p>7. Sozomen (middle of fifth century), H. E., vii., 19, says: “For instance, the so-called
Apocalypse of Peter which was esteemed as entirely spurious by the ancients, we have discovered
to be read in certain churches of Palestine up to the present day, once a year, on
the day of preparation, during which the people most religiously fast in commemoration
of the Saviour’s Passion” (i.e., on Good Friday). It is to be noted that Sozomen himself belonged
to Palestine.</p>
<p>8. In the list of the Sixty Books which is assigned to the fifth or sixth century the Revelation
of Peter is mentioned among the Apocrypha (v. Westcott, Canon, p. 551).</p>
<p>9. The so-called Stichometry of Nicephorus, a list of scriptures with notes of their extent,
ascribed to Nicephorus, Patriarch of Constantinople, 806–814 a.d., includes the Revelation
of Peter among the antilegomena or disputed writings of the New Testament, and gives it
three hundred stichoi or thirty more than the above-mentioned Catalogus Claromontanas.</p>
<p>10. The Armenian annalist Mkhitan (thirteenth century) in a list of the New Testament
antilegomena mentions the Revelation of Peter, after the Gospel of Thomas and before the
Periodoi Pauli, and remarks that he has himself copied these books. (Cf. Harnack, Geschichte
der altchristlichen Literatur.)</p>
<p>Up till lately these facts represented all that was positively known of the Revelation of
Peter. From them we gather that it must have been written before the middle of the second
century (so as to be known at Rome and included in the Muratorian Canon), that it had a
wide circulation, that it was for some time very popular, so that it would appear to have run
a considerable chance of achieving a place in the canon, but that it was ultimately rejected
and in the long run dropped out of knowledge altogether. But even previously to the discovery
at Akhmîm, the general character of the book had been inferred from the scanty
fragments preserved in ancient writers and from the common elements contained in other
and later apocalyptic writings which seemed to require some such book as the Revelation
of Peter as their ultimate source. Such writings are the (Christian) Apocalypse of Esdras,
the Vision of Paul, the Passion of S. Perpetua and the visions contained in the History of
<pb n="301"/>
Barlaam and Josaphat. (Cf. Robinson, Texts and Studies, i., 2, p. 37–43, and Robinson and
James, The Gospel according to Peter and the Revelation of Peter, 1892.)</p>
<p>The Revelation of Peter affords the earliest embodiment in Christian literature of those
pictorial presentations of heaven and hell which have exercised so widespread and enduring
an influence. It has, in its imagery, little or no kinship with the Book of Daniel, the Book
of Enoch, or the Revelation of S. John. Its only parallels in canonical scripture, with the
notable exception of the Second Epistle of Peter, are to be found in Isaiah lxvi. 24, Mark ix.
44, 48, and the parable of Dives and Lazarus in Luke xvi. 19. It is indeed Judaic in the
severity of its morality and even in its phraseology (cf. the frequent use of the word righteous,
and the idea that God and not Christ will come to judge sinners). But the true parallels for,
if not the sources of, its imagery of the rewards and punishments which await men after
death are to be found in Greek beliefs which have left their traces in such passages as the
Vision of Er at the end of Plato’s Republic.</p>
<p>The heaven of the Petrine Apocalypse is akin to the Elysian Fields and the Islands of
the Blest. In it the saints are crowned as with flowers and beautiful of countenance, singing
songs of praise in the fragrant air, in a land all lighted up with the light of the sun.3876 We
are reminded of “the Elysian Fields and the world’s end where is Rhadamanthus of the fair
hair, where life is easiest for men. No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain; but
alway Ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill West to blow cool on men” (Odyssey, iv.,
563), and of the garden of the gods on Olympus, which “is not shaken by winds, or ever wet
with rain, nor doth the snow come nigh thereto, but most clear air is spread about it
cloudless, and the white light floats over it” (Odyssey, vi., 43, Butcher and Lang’s transl.).
Perhaps the most striking parallel of all is afforded by the fragment of a dirge of Pindar:
“For them shineth below the strength of the sun, while in our world it is night, and the space
of crimson-flowered meadow before their city is full of the shade of frankincense trees, and
of fruits of gold. And some in horses, and in bodily feats, and some in dice, and some in
harp-playing have delight; and among them thriveth all fair-flowering bliss; and fragrance
streameth ever through the lovely land, as they mingle incense of every kind upon the altars
of the gods” (Pindar, E. Myer’s transl., p. 176). Beside this heaven the New Jerusalem of the
canonical Apocalypse is austere. But it is the spiritual city. “For the city had no need of the
sun, neither of the moon to shine on it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb were in
the midst of it and the Lamb was the light thereof.”</p>
<p>So likewise in the case of the torments of the wicked as presented in the Revelation of
Peter. We are not here in the Jewish Sheol, or among the fires of the valley of Hinnom, so
<note type="footnote">3876 Cf. “…the island valley of Avilion; Where falls not rain or hail or any snow, Nor ever wind blows loudly;
but it lies Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard lawns And bowery hollows crowned with summer seas.”
Tennyson, Passing of Arthur.</note>
    
<pb n="302"/>
much as among the tortures of Tartarus and the boiling mud of the Acherusian Lake (cf.
Plato, Phædo, p. 113; Aristophanes, Frogs, line 145), or where “wild men of fiery aspect…
seized and carried off several of them, and Ardiæus and others, they bound head and
foot and hand, and threw them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them
along the road at the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring to the passersby
what were their crimes, and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell” (Republic,
x., p. 616, Jowett’s transl.). It is not surprising that in later visions of the same kind the very
names of the Greek under-world are ascribed to localities of hell. It is across the river
Oceanus. It is called Tartarus. In it is the Acherusian Lake. Notice in this connection that
the souls of innocent victims are present along with their murderers to accuse them.</p>
<p>The Revelation of Peter shows remarkable kinship in ideas with the Second Epistle of
Peter. The parallels will be noted in the margin of the translation. It also presents notable
parallels to the Sibylline Oracles (cf. Orac. Sib., ii., 225 sqq.), while its influence has been
conjectured, almost with certainty, in the Acts of Perpetua and the visions narrated in the
Acts of Thomas and the History of Barlaam and Josaphat. It certainly was one of the sources
from which the writer of the Vision of Paul drew. And directly or indirectly it may be regarded
as the parent of all the mediæval visions of the other world.</p>
<p>The fragment begins in the middle of an eschatological discourse of Jesus, probably
represented as delivered after the resurrection, for verse 5 implies that the disciples had begun
to preach the Gospel. It ends abruptly in the course of a catalogue of sinners in hell and
their punishments. The fragments preserved in the writings of Clement of Alexandria and
Methodius probably belonged to the lost end of the book; that preserved by Macarius Magnes
may have belonged to the eschatological discourse at the beginning. Taking the length of
the whole at from two hundred and seventy to three hundred stichoi, the Akhmîm fragment
contains about the half.</p>
<p>The present translation is made from Harnack’s edition of the text, 2d ed., Leipzig, 1893.</p>
<p>There is another and later Apocalypse of Peter in Arabic, of which mss. exist in Rome
and Oxford. It is called the Apocalypse of Peter, or the narrative of things revealed to him by
Jesus Christ which had taken place from the beginning of the world and which shall take place
till the end of the world or the second coming of Christ. The book is said to have been written
by Clement, to whom Peter had communicated the secrets revealed to him. The writer
himself calls the book Librum Perfectionis or Librum Completum. Judging from the analysis
of its contents quoted by Tischendorf (Apocalypses Apocr.) it has no connection with the
present work.</p>

And going with him, we, the twelve disciples, begged that he would show us one of our
brethren, the righteous who are gone forth out of the world, in order that we might see of
what manner of form they are, and having taken courage, might also encourage3881 the men

the East, on whom we were not able to look;3882 7, for there came forth from their countenance
a ray as of the sun, and their raiment was shining, such as eye of man3883 never saw;
for no mouth is able to express or heart to conceive the glory with which they were endued,

thereof was mingled with the white, and I am utterly unable to express their beauty; 10, for

such was their seemliness.</p>

him: And where are all the righteous ones and what is the æon in which they are and have
this glory?</p>
<p>15. And the Lord showed me3886 a very great country outside of this world, exceeding
bright with light, and the air there lighted with the rays of the sun, and the earth itself
blooming with unfading flowers and full of spices and plants, fair-flowering and incorruptible
and bearing blessed fruit. 16. And so great was the perfume that it3887 was borne thence
even unto us. 17. And the dwellers in that place were clad in the raiment of shining angels
and their raiment was like unto their country; and angels hovered about them there. 18.
And the glory of the dwellers there was equal, and with one voice they sang praises alternately
to the Lord God, rejoicing in that place. 19. The Lord saith to us: This is the place of your
high-priests,3888 the righteous men.</p>
<p>20. And over against that place I saw another, squalid, and it was the place of punishment;
and those who were punished there and the punishing angels had their raiment
dark3889 like the air of the place.</p>
<p>21. And there were certain there hanging by the tongue: and these were the blasphemers
of the way of righteousness; and under them lay fire,3890 burning and punishing them.</p>
<p>22. And there was a great lake, full of flaming mire, in which were certain men that
pervert righteousness,3891 and tormenting angels afflicted them.</p>
<p>23. And there were also others, women, hanged by their hair over that mire that bubbled
up: and these were they who adorned themselves for adultery; and the men who mingled
with them in the defilement3892 of adultery, were hanging by the feet and their heads in that
mire. And I said: I did not believe that I should come into this place.</p>
<p>24. And I saw the murderers and those who conspired with them, cast into a certain
strait place, full of evil snakes, and smitten by those beasts, and thus turning to and fro in
that punishment; and worms,3893 as it were clouds of darkness, afflicted them. And the
souls of the murdered stood and looked upon the punishment of those murderers and said:
O God, thy judgment is just.</p>

<p>25. And near that place I saw another strait place into which the gore and the filth of
those who were being punished ran down and became there as it were a lake: and there sat
women having the gore up to their necks, and over against them sat many children who
were born to them out of due time, crying; and there came forth from them sparks of fire
and smote the women in the eyes: and these were the accursed who conceived and caused
abortion.</p>
<p>26. And other men and women were burning up to the middle and were cast into a
dark place and were beaten by evil spirits, and their inwards were eaten by restless worms:3894
and these were they who persecuted the righteous and delivered them up.</p>
<p>27. And near those there were again women and men gnawing their own lips, and being
punished and receiving a red-hot iron in their eyes: and these were they who blasphemed
and slandered3895 the way of righteousness.</p>
<p>28. And over against these again other men and women gnawing their tongues and
having flaming fire in their mouths: and these were the false witnesses.3896</p>
<p>29. And in a certain other place there were pebbles sharper than swords or any spit,
red-hot, and women and men in tattered and filthy raiment rolled about on them in punishment:
and these were the rich who trusted in their riches and had no pity for orphans and
widows, and despised the commandment3897 of God.</p>
<p>30. And in another great lake, full of pitch and blood and mire bubbling up, there stood
men and women up to their knees: and these were the usurers and those who take interest
on interest.</p>
<p>31. And other men and women were being hurled down from a great cliff and reached
the bottom, and again were driven by those who were set over them to climb up upon the
cliff, and thence were hurled down again, and had no rest from this punishment: and these
were they who defiled3898 their bodies acting as women; and the women who were with
them were those who lay with one another as a man with a woman.</p>
<p>32. And alongside of that cliff there was a place full of much fire, and there stood men
who with their own hands had made for themselves carven images instead of God. And
alongside of these were other men and women, having rods and striking each other and
never ceasing from such punishment.</p>

<head>Fragments of the Apocalypse of Peter.</head>
<p>1. Clemens Alexandrinus, Eclog. 48. For instance, Peter in the Apocalypse says that
the children who are born out of due time shall be of the better part: and that these are delivered
over to a care-taking angel that they may attain a share of knowledge and gain the
better abode [after suffering what they would have suffered if they had been in the body:
but the others shall merely obtain salvation as injured beings to whom mercy is shown, and
remain without punishment, receiving this as a reward].3900</p>
<p>2. Clem. Alex. Eclog. 49. But the milk of the women running down from their breasts
and congealing shall engender small flesh-eating beasts: and these run up upon them and
devour them.3901</p>
<p>3. Macarius Magnes, Apocritica iv., 6 cf. 16. The earth, it (sc. the Apoc. of Peter) says,
“shall present all men before God at the day of judgment, being itself also to be judged, with
the heaven also which encompasses it.”</p>
<p>4. Clem. Alex. Eclog. 41. The scripture says that infants that have been exposed are
delivered to a care-taking angel, by whom they are educated and so grow up, and they will
be, it says, as the faithful of a hundred years old are here.</p>
<p>5. Methodius, Conviv. ii., 6. Whence also we have received in divinely-inspired scriptures
that untimely births are delivered to care-taking angels, even if they are the offspring of
adultery.</p>

<head>The Vision of Paul.</head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The present translation of the Vision of Paul is made from the text of a Latin version,
edited by Mr. M. R. James in the Cambridge Texts and Studies, ii., 3, p. 11 ff.—from a ms.
of the eighth century now in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris.</p>
<p>Tischendorf’s Greek text was based on two mss., the earliest of which is at Munich and
is of the thirteenth century. This version has already been translated in the Ante-Nicene
Library, vol. xvi.</p>
<p>A translation into English from a Syriac version (date unknown) was published by the
Rev. J. Perkins, D.D., in the Journal of Sacred Literature, N. S., vol. vi., 1865, and republished
by Tischendorf alongside of the Greek version in his Apocalypses Apocryphæ.</p>
<p>The Revelation of Paul was known to S. Augustine, who thus refers to it in his Tractate
98 on the Gospel of John, § 8: “…There have been some vain individuals, who, with a presumption
that betrays the grossest folly, have forged a Revelation of Paul, crammed with
all manner of fables, which has been rejected by the Orthodox Church; affirming it to be
that whereof he had said that he was caught up into the third heavens, and there heard unspeakable
words ‘which it is not lawful for a man to utter.’ Nevertheless, the audacity of
such might be tolerable, had he said that he heard words which it is not as yet lawful for a
man to utter; but when he said ‘which it is not lawful for a man to utter,’ who are they that
dare to utter them with such impudence and non-success?”</p>
<p>Sozomen, H. E., vii., 19, after speaking of the Apocalypse of Peter, continues: “So the
work entitled ‘The Apocalypse of the Apostle Paul,’ though rejected by the ancients, is still
esteemed by most of the monks. Some persons affirm that the book was found during this
reign (i.e., of Theodosius) by divine revelation, in a marble box, buried beneath the soil, in
the house of Paul, at Tarsus, in Cilicia. I have been informed that this report is false, by a
presbyter of Tarsus, a man of very advanced age, as is indicated by his grey hairs.”</p>
<p>The book was probably composed, or rather compiled, for it is largely indebted to previous
Apocalyptic writings, about the time when it purports to have been discovered at
Tarsus, i.e., 388 a.d., the year of the consulship of Theodosius the Less and Cynegius. The
alleged sending of a copy of the original to Jerusalem probably indicates the place where it
was composed, or, at least, first found currency.</p>
<p>The Vision of Paul seems to have enjoyed great popularity during the Middle Ages.
Brandes (Halle, 1885), in his edition of two shorter Latin versions, enumerates twenty-two

<pb n="309"/>
different mss. of the Latin and “gives particulars of French, English, Danish, and Slavonic
forms of the legend.”</p>
<p>Of the three main versions, the Latin and Syriac are longer and fuller than the Greek,
which in its present form has been abbreviated. Taking advantage of the excellent comparative
table presented by Mr. M. R. James in his edition of the text, the translator has endeavoured
to point out to the reader, by notes in the margin, the passages where the Latin varies
from the Greek, and, to a less extent, from the Syriac. Parallel passages in other and earlier
Apocalyptic writings are also indicated in the notes.</p>

<head>The Vision of Paul.</head>
<p>Here Begins the Vision of Saint Paul the Apostle.</p>
<p>“But I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord: I know a man in Christ fourteen
years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or out of the body, I know not, God knoweth)
snatched up in this manner to the third heaven: and I know such a man, whether in the
body or out of the body I know not, God knoweth; how that he was snatched up into Paradise
and heard secret words which it is not lawful for men to speak; on behalf of such a one will
I glory; but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my infirmities.”—2 Cor. xii. 1–5.</p>
<p>1. At what time was this revelation made? In the consulship of Theodosius Augustus
the Younger and Cynegius,3902 a certain nobleman then living in Tharsus, in the house
which was that of Saint Paul, an angel appearing in the night revealed to him, saying that
he should open the foundations of the house and should publish what he found, but he
thought that these things were dreams.</p>
<p>2. But the angel coming for the third time beat him and forced him to open the
foundation. And digging he found a marble box, inscribed on the sides; there was the revelation
of Saint Paul, and his shoes in which he walked teaching the word of God. But he
feared to open that box and brought it to the judge; when he had received it, the judge, because
it was sealed with lead, sent it to the Emperor Theodosius, fearing lest it might be
something else; which when he had received the emperor opened it, and found the revelation
of Saint Paul; a copy of it he sent to Jerusalem, and retained the original himself.</p>
<p>3. While I was in the body in which I was snatched up to the third heaven, the word of
the Lord came to me saying: speak to the people: until when will ye transgress, and heap
sin upon sin, and tempt the Lord who made you? Ye are the sons of God, doing the works
of the devil in the faith of Christ, on account of the impediments of the world. Remember
therefore and know that while every creature serves God, the human race alone sins. But
it reigns over every creature and sins more than all nature.</p>
<p>4. For indeed the sun, the great light, often addressed the Lord saying: Lord God
Almighty, I look out upon the impieties and injustices of men; permit me and I shall do
unto them what are my powers, that they may know that thou art God alone. And there
came a voice saying to him: I know all these things, for mine eye sees and ear hears, but my
patience bears them until they shall be converted and repent. But if they do not return to
me I will judge them all.</p>
<note type="footnote">3902 Theodosius the younger and Cynegius, Consuls, 388 a.d.</note>
    
<pb n="311"/>
<p>5. For sometimes the moon and stars addressed the Lord saying: Lord God Almighty,
to us thou hast given the power of the night; till when shall we look down upon the impieties
and fornications and homicides done by the sons of men? Permit us to do unto them according
to our powers, that they may know that thou art God alone. And there came a voice
unto them saying: I know all these things, and mine eye looks forth and ear hears, but my
patience bears with them until they shall be converted and repent. But if they do not return
unto me I will judge them.</p>
<p>6. And frequently also the sea exclaimed saying: Lord God Almighty, men have defiled
thy holy name in me; permit me to arise and cover every wood and orchard and the whole
world, until I blot out all the sons of men from before thy face, that they may know that
thou art God alone. And the voice came again and said: I know all things; mine eye seeth
everything, and mine ear heareth, but my patience bears with them until they be converted
and repent. But if they do not return, I will judge them. Sometimes the waters3903 also
spoke against the sins of men saying: Lord God Almighty, all the sons of men have defiled
thy holy name. And there came a voice saying: I know all things before they come to pass,
for mine eye seeth and mine ear heareth all things, but my patience bears with them until
they be converted. But if not I will judge them. Frequently also the earth3904 too exclaimed
to the Lord against the sons of men saying: Lord God Almighty, I above every other creature
of thine am harmed, supporting the fornications, adulteries, homicides, thefts, perjuries
and magic and ill-doings of men and all the evil they do, so that the father rises up against
the son, and the son upon the father, the alien against the alien, so that each one defiles his
neighbour’s wife. The father ascends upon the bed of his own son, and the son likewise ascends
the couch of his own father; and in all these evils, they who offer the sacrifice to thy
name have defiled thy holy place. Therefore I am injured above every creature, desiring not
to shew my power to myself, and my fruits to the sons of men. Permit me and I will destroy
the virtue of my fruits. And there came a voice and said: I know all things, and there is
none who can hide himself from his sin. Moreover I know their impieties, but my holiness
suffers them until they be converted and repent. But if they do not return unto me I will
judge them.</p>
<p>7. Behold, ye sons of men, the creature is subject to God, but the human race alone
sins. For this cause, therefore, ye sons of men, bless the Lord God unceasingly, every hour
and every day: but more especially when the sun has set:3905 for at that hour all the angels
proceed to the Lord to worship him and to present the works of men, which every man has
wrought from the morning till the evening, whether good or evil. And there is a certain

angel who proceeds rejoicing concerning the man in whom he dwells. When therefore the
sun3906 has set in the first hour of night, in the same hour the angel of every people and
every man and woman, who protect and preserve them, because man is the image of God:
similarly also in the matin hour which is the twelfth of the night, all the angels of men and
women, go up to God to worship God, and present every work which each man has wrought,
whether good or evil. Moreover every day and night the angels show to God an account3907
of all the acts of the human race. To you, therefore, I say, ye sons of men, bless the Lord
God without fail all the days of your life.</p>
<p>8. Therefore at the appointed hour all the angels whatever, rejoicing at once together,
proceed before God that they may meet to worship at the hour determined. And behold
suddenly it became the hour of meeting, and the angels came to worship in the presence of
God, and the spirit proceeded to meet them: and there came a voice and said: Whence
come ye, our angels, bearing the burdens of tidings?</p>
<p>9. They answered and said: We come from those who have renounced this world for
the sake of thy holy name, wandering as pilgrims, and in caves of the rocks, and weeping
every hour in which they inhabited the earth, and hungering and thirsting because of thy
name, with their loins girded, having in their hands the incense of their hearts, and praying
and blessing every hour, and restraining and overcoming themselves, weeping and wailing
above the rest that inhabit the earth. And we indeed, their angels, mourn along with them:
whither therefore it shall please thee, command us to go and minister, lest others also do it,
but the destitute above the rest who are on earth. And there came the voice of God to them
saying: Know ye that now henceforward my grace is appointed unto you, and my help, who
is my well-beloved Son, shall be present with them, guiding them every hour; ministering
also to them, never deserting them, since their place is his habitation.</p>
<p>10. When therefore these angels had retired, behold other angels came to adore in the
presence of honour, in the assembly, who wept; and the spirit of God proceeded to meet
them, and there came the voice of God and said: Whence come ye, our angels, bearing the
burdens of the ministry of the tidings of the world? They answered and said in the presence
of God: We have arrived from those who called upon thy name, and the impediments of
the world made them wretched, devising many occasions every hour, not even making one
pure prayer, nor out of their whole heart, in all the time of their life; what need, therefore,
is there to be present with men who are sinners? And there came the voice of God to them:
It is necessary that ye should minister to them, until they be converted and repent: but if
they do not return to me I will judge them. Know therefore, sons of men, that whatever
things are wrought by you, these angels relate to God, whether good or evil.</p>

<p>11. And the angel answered and said unto me: Follow me, and I will show you the place
of the just where they are led when they are deceased, and after these things taking thee into
the abyss, I will show thee the souls of sinners and what sort of place they are led into when
they have deceased. And I proceeded back after the angel, and he led me into heaven, and
I looked back upon the firmament, and I saw in the same place power, and there was there
oblivion which deceives and draws down to itself the hearts of men, and the spirit of detraction,
and the spirit of fornication, and the spirit of madness, and the spirit of insolence, and
there were there the princes of vices: these I saw under the firmament of heaven: and again
I looked back, and I saw angels without mercy, having no pity, whose countenance was full
of madness, and their teeth sticking out beyond the mouth: their eyes shone like the
morning star of the east, and from the hairs of their head sparks of fire went out, or from
their mouth. And I asked the angel saying: Sir, who are those? And the angel answered
and said unto me: These are those who are destined to the souls of the impious in the hour
of need, who did not believe that they had the Lord for their helper, nor hoped in him.</p>
<p>12. And I looked on high and I saw other angels whose countenance shone as the sun,
their loins girded with golden girdles, having palms in their hands, and the sign of God,
clothed with garments in which was written the name of the Son of God, filled moreover
with all meekness and pity; and I asked the angels saying: Who are these, Lord, in so great
beauty and pity? And the angel answered and said unto me: These are the angels of justice
who are sent to lead up the souls of the just, in the hour of need, who believed that they had
the Lord for their helper. And I said to him: Do the just and sinners necessarily meet witnesses
when they have died? And the angel answered and said to me: There is one way by
which all pass over to God, but the just having their helper with them are not confounded
when they go to appear in the sight of God.</p>
<p>13. And I said to the angel: I wished to see the souls of the just and of sinners going
out of the world. And the angel answered and said unto me: Look down upon the earth.
And I looked down from heaven upon the earth, and saw the whole world, and it was
nothing in my sight and I saw the sons of men as though they were naught, and a-wanting,
and I wondered and said to the angel: Is this the greatness of men? And the angel answered
and said unto me: It is, and these are they who do evil from morning till evening. And I
looked and saw a great cloud of fire spread over the whole world, and I said to the angel:
What is this, my Lord? and he said to me: This is injustice stirred up by the princes of sinners.</p>
<p>14. I indeed when I had heard this sighed and wept, and said to the angel: I wished to
see the souls of the just and of sinners, and to see in what manner they go out of the body.
And the angel answered and said unto me: Look again upon the earth. And I looked and
saw all the world, and men were as naught and a-wanting: and I looked carefully and saw
a certain man about to die, and the angel said to me: This one whom thou seest is a just
man. And I looked again and saw all his works, whatever he had done for the sake of God’s

<pb n="314"/>
name, and all his desires, both what he remembered, and what he did not remember; they
all stood in his sight in the hour of need; and I saw the just man advance and find refreshment
and confidence, and before he went out of the world the holy and the impious angels both
attended: and I saw them all, but the impious found no place of habitation in him, but the
holy took possession of his soul, guiding it till it went out of the body: and they roused the
soul saying: Soul, know thy body whence thou goest out, for it is necessary that thou shouldst
return to the same body on the day of the resurrection, that thou mayest receive the things
promised to all the just. Receiving therefore the soul from the body, they immediately kissed
it as familiarly known to them, saying to it: Do manfully, for thou hast done the will of God
while placed in the earth. And there came to meet him the angel who watched him every
day, and said to him: Do manfully, soul; for I rejoice in thee, because thou hast done the
will of God on earth: for I related to God all thy works, such as they were. Similarly also
the spirit proceeded to meet him and said: Soul, fear not, nor be disturbed, until thou comest
into a place which thou hast never known, but I will be a helper unto thee: for I found in
thee a place of refreshment in the time when I dwelt in thee, while I was on earth. And his
spirit strengthened him, and his angel received him, and led him into heaven: and an angel
said: Whither runnest thou, O soul, and dost thou dare to enter into heaven? Wait and let
us see if there is anything of ours in thee: and behold we find nothing in thee. I see also thy
divine helper and angel, and the spirit is rejoicing along with thee, because thou hast done
the will of God on earth. And they led him along till he should worship in the sight of God.
And when they had ceased, immediately Michael and all the army of angels, with one voice,
adored the footstool of his feet, and his doom, saying at the same time to the soul: This is
your God of all things, who made you in his own image and likeness. Moreover the angel
returns and points him out saying: God, remember his labours: for this is the soul, whose
works I related to thee, doing according to thy judgment. And the spirit said likewise: I am
the spirit of vivification inspiring him: for I had refreshment in him, in the time when I
dwelt in him, doing according to thy judgment. And there came the voice of God and said:
In as much as this man did not vex me, neither will I vex him; for according as he had pity,
I also will have pity. Let him therefore be handed over to Michael, the angel of the Covenant,
and let him lead him into the Paradise of joy, that he himself may become co-heir with all
the saints. And after these things I heard the voices of a thousand thousand angels, and
archangels, and cherubim, and twenty-four elders saying hymns, and glorifying the Lord
and crying: thou art just, O Lord, and just are thy judgments, and there is no acceptance of
persons with thee, but thou rewardest unto every man according to thy judgment. And the
angel answered and said unto me: Hast thou believed and known, that whatever each man
of you has done, he sees in the hour of need? And I said: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>15. And he saith to me: Look again down on the earth, and watch the soul of an impious
man going out of the body, which vexed the Lord day and night, saying: I know nothing

<pb n="315"/>
else in this world, I eat and drink, and enjoy what is in the world; for who is there who has
descended into hell, and ascending has declared to us that there is judgment there! And
again I looked carefully, and saw all the scorn of the sinner, and all that he did, and they
stood together before him in the hour of need: and it was done to him in that hour, in which
he was threatened about his body at the judgment, and I said: It were better for him if he
had not been born. And after these things, there came at the same time, the holy angels,
and the malign, and the soul of the sinner and the holy angels did not find a place in it.
Moreover the malign angels cursed it; and when they had drawn it out of the body, the angels
admonished it a third time, saying: O wretched soul, look upon thy flesh, whence thou
camest out: for it is necessary that thou shouldst return to thy flesh in the day of resurrection,
that thou mayest receive the due for thy sins and thy impieties.</p>
<p>16. And when they had led it forth, the customary angel preceded it, and said to it: O
wretched soul, I am the angel belonging to thee, relating daily to the Lord thy malign works,
whatever thou didst by night or day: and if it were in my power, not for one day would I
minister to thee, but none of these things was I able to do: the judge is pitiful and just, and
he himself commanded us that we should not cease to minister to the soul, till you should
repent, but thou hast lost the time of repentance. I indeed was strange to thee and thou to
me. Let us go on then to the just judge: I will not dismiss thee, before I know from to-day
why I was strange to thee. And the spirit confounded him, and the angel troubled him.
When, therefore, they had arrived at the power, when he started to enter heaven, a labour
was imposed upon him, above all other labour: error and oblivion and murmuring met
him, and the spirit of fornication, and the rest of the powers, and said to him: Whither goest
thou, wretched soul, and darest thou to rush into heaven? hold, that we may see if we have
our qualities in thee, since we do not see that thou hast a holy helper. And after that I heard
voices in the height of heaven saying: Present that wretched soul to God, that it may know
that it is God that it despised. When, therefore, it had entered heaven, all the angels saw it,
a thousand thousand exclaimed with one voice, all saying: Woe to thee, wretched soul, for
the sake of thy works which thou didst on earth; what answer art thou about to give to God
when thou shalt have approached to adore him? The angel who was with it answered and
said: Weep with me, my beloved, for I have not found rest in this soul. And the angels
answered him and said: Let such a soul be taken away from the midst of ours, for from the
time he entered, the stink of him crosses to us angels. And after these things it was presented,
that it might worship in the sight of God, and an angel of God showed him God who made
him after his own image and likeness. Moreover his angel ran before him saying: Lord God
Almighty, I am the angel of this soul, whose works I presented to thee day and night, not

<pb n="316"/>
doing according to thy judgment. And the spirit likewise said: I am the spirit who dwelt
in it from the time it was made, in itself moreover I know it, and it has not followed my will:
judge it, Lord, according to thy judgment. And there came the voice of God to it and said:
Where is thy fruit which thou has made worthy of the goods which thou hast received?
Have I put a distance of one day between thee and the just man? Did I not make the sun to
arise upon thee as upon the just? But the soul was silent, having nothing to answer: and
again there came a voice saying: Just is the judgment of God, and there is no acceptance of
persons with God, for whoever shall have done mercy, on them shall he have mercy, and
whoever shall not have pitied neither shall God pity him. Let him therefore be handed over
to the angel Tartaruch, who is set over the punishments, and let him place him in outer
darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, and let him be there till the great
day of judgment. And after these things I heard the voice of angels and archangels saying:
Thou art just, Lord, and thy judgment is just.</p>
<p>17. And again I saw, and behold a soul which was led forward by two angels, weeping
and saying: Have pity on me, just God, God the judge, for to-day is seven days since I went
out of my body, and I was handed over to these two angels, and they led me through to
those places, which I had never seen. And God, the just judge, saith to him: What hast thou
done? for thou never didst mercy, wherefore thou wast handed over to such angels as have
no mercy, and because thou didst not do uprightly, so neither did they act piously with thee
in the hour of thy need. Confess therefore thy sins which thou didst commit when placed
in the world. And he answered and said: Lord, I did not sin. And the Lord, the just Lord,
was angered in fury when it said: I did not sin, because it lied; and God said: Dost thou
think thou art still in the world? if any one of you, sinning there, conceal and hide his sin
from his neighbour, here indeed nothing whatever shall be hid: for when the souls come
to adore in sight of the throne, both the good works and the sins of each one are made
manifest. And hearing these things the soul was silent, having no answer. And I heard the
Lord God, the just judge, again saying: Come, angel of this soul, and stand in the midst.
And the angel of the sinful soul came, having in his hands a manuscript, and said: These,
Lord, in my hands, are all the sins of this soul from his youth till to-day, from the tenth year
of his birth: and if thou command, Lord, I will also relate his acts from the beginning of his
fifteenth year. And the Lord God, the just judge, said: I say unto thee, angel, I do not expect
of thee an account of him since he began to be fifteen years old, but state his sins for five
years before he died and before he came hither. And again God, the just judge, said: For
by myself I swear, and by my holy angels, and by my virtue, that if he had repented five years
before he died, on account of one year’s life, oblivion would now be thrown over all the evils
which he sinned before, and he would have indulgence and remission of sins: now indeed
he shall perish. And the angel of the sinful soul answered and said: Lord, command that
angel to exhibit those souls.</p>
    
<pb n="317"/>
<p>18. And in that same hour the souls were exhibited in the midst, and the soul of the
sinner knew them; and the Lord said to the soul of the sinner: I say unto thee, soul, confess
thy work which thou wroughtest in these souls, whom thou seest, when they were in the
world. And he answered and said: Lord, it is not yet a full year since I slew this one and
poured his blood upon the ground, and with another (a woman) I committed fornication:
not this alone, but I also greatly harmed her in taking away her goods. And the Lord God,
the just judge, said: Either thou didst not know that he who does violence to another, if he
dies first who sustains the violence, is kept in this place until the doer of hurt dies, and then
both stand in the presence of the judge, and now each receives according to his deed. And
I heard a voice of one saying: Let that soul be delivered into the hands of Tartarus, and led
down into hell: he shall lead him into the lower prison and he shall be put in torments, and
left there till the great day of judgment. And again I heard a thousand thousand angels
saying hymns to the Lord, and crying: Thou art just, O Lord, and just are thy judgments.</p>
<p>19. The angel answered and said unto me: Hast thou perceived all these things? and I
said, Yes, sir. And he said to me: Follow me again, and I will take thee, and show thee the
places of the just. And I followed the angel, and he raised me to the third heaven, and placed
me at the entry of the door: and looking carefully I saw, and the door was of gold, and two
columns of gold, full above of golden letters, and the angel tuned again to me and said:
Blessed wert thou, if thou hadst entered into these doors, for it is not allowed to any to enter
except only to those who have goodness and innocence of body in all things. And I asked
the angel about everything and said: Sir, tell me on what account these letters are put upon
those tables? The angel answered and said unto me: These are the names of the just, serving
God with their whole heart, who dwell on the earth. And again I said: Sir, therefore their
names and countenance and the likeness of these who serve God are in heaven, and are
known to the angels: for they know who are the servants of God with all their heart, before
they go out of the world.</p>
<p>20. And when I had entered the interior of the gate of Paradise,3908 there came out to
meet me an old man whose countenance shone as the sun; and when he had embraced me
he said: Hail, Paul, beloved of God. And he kissed me with a cheerful countenance. He
wept, and I said to him: Brother, why dost thou weep? And again sighing and lamenting
he said: We are hurt by men, and they vex us greatly; for many are the good things which
the Lord has prepared, and great is his promise, but many do not perceive them. And I
asked the angel, and said: Sir, who is this? And he said to me: This is Enoch, the scribe of
righteousness. And I entered into the interior of that place, and immediately I saw the
sun,3909 and coming it saluted me laughing and rejoicing. And when it had seen (me), it
<note type="footnote">3908 Cf. Ascension of Isaiah ix. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">3909 And the sun. Not in Greek: Elias in Syriac.</note>
    
<pb n="318"/>
turned away and wept, and said to me: Paul, would that thou shouldst receive thy labours
which thou hast done in the human race. For me, indeed, I have seen the great and many
good things, which God has prepared for the just, and the promises of God are great, but
many do not perceive them; but even by many labours scarcely one or two enters into these
places.</p>
<p>21. And the angel answered and said to me,3910 Whatever I now show thee here, and
whatever thou shalt hear, tell it not to any one in the earth. And he led me and shewed me:
and there I heard words which it is not lawful for a man to speak. And again he said, For
now follow me, and I will shew thee what thou oughtest to narrate in public and relate.</p>
<p>And he took me down from the third heaven, and led me into the second heaven, and
again he led me on to the firmament and from the firmament he led me over the doors of
heaven: the beginning of its foundation was on the river which waters all the earth. And I
asked the angel and said, Lord, what is this river of water? and he said to me, This is
Oceanus! And suddenly I went out of heaven, and I understood that it is the light of heaven
which lightens all the earth. For the land there is seven times brighter3911 than silver. And
I said, Lord, what is this place? And he said to me, This is the land of promise. Hast thou
never heard what is written: Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth? The
souls therefore of the just, when they have gone out of the body, are meanwhile dismissed
to this place. And I said to the angel, Then this land will be manifested before the time?
The angel answered and said to me, When Christ, whom thou preachest, shall come to reign,
then, by the sentence of God,3912 the first earth will be dissolved and this land of promise
will then be revealed, and it will be like dew or cloud, and then the Lord Jesus Christ, the
King Eternal, will be manifested and will come with all his saints to dwell in it, and he will
reign over them a thousand years, and they will eat of the good things which I shall now
show unto thee.</p>
<p>22. And I looked around upon that land and I saw a river flowing of milk and honey,
and there were trees planted by the bank of that river, full of fruit: moreover each single
tree bore twelve fruits in the year, having various and diverse fruits: and I saw the created
things which are in that place and all the work of God, and I saw there palms of twenty cubits,
but others of ten cubits: and that land was seven times brighter than silver. And there were
trees full of fruits from the roots to the highest branches, of ten thousand fruits of palms
upon ten thousand fruits. The grape-vines moreover had ten thousand plants.3913 Moreover
in the single vines there were ten thousand thousand bunches and in each of these a thousand

<pb n="319"/>
single grapes: moreover these single trees bore a thousand fruits. And I said to the angel,
Why does each tree bear a thousand fruits? The angel answered and said unto me, Because
the Lord God gives an abounding flood of gifts to the worthy, because they also of their own
will afflicted themselves when they were placed in the world doing all things on account of
his holy name. And again I said to the angel, Sir, are these the only promises which the
Most Holy God makes? And he answered and said to me: No! there are seven times greater
than these. But I say unto thee that when the just go out of the body they shall see the
promises and the good things which God has prepared for them. Till then, they shall sigh,
and lament saying: Have we emitted any word from our mouth to vex our neighbour even
on one day? I asked and said again: Are these alone the promises of God? And the angel
answered and said unto me: These whom you now see are the souls of the married3914 and
those who kept the chastity of their nuptials, containing themselves. But to the virgins and
those who hunger and thirst after righteousness and those who afflicted themselves for the
sake of the name of God, God will give seven times greater than these, which I shall now
show thee.</p>
<p>And then he took me up from that place where I saw these things and behold, a river,
and its waters were greatly whiter than milk, and I said to the angel, What is this? And he
said to me: This is the Acherousian Lake where is the City of Christ, but not every man is
permitted to enter that city; for this is the journey which leads to God, and if anyone is a
fornicator and impious, and is converted and shall repent and do fruits worthy of repentance,
at first indeed when he shall have gone out of the body, he is led and adores God, and thence
by command of the Lord he is delivered to the angel Michael and he baptizes him in the
Acherousian Lake—thus he leads them into the City of Christ alongside of those who have
never sinned. But I wondered and blessed the Lord God for all the things which I saw.</p>
<p>23. And the angel answered and said unto me: Follow me and I will lead thee into the
City of Christ. And he was standing on the Acherousian Lake and he put me into a golden
ship3915 and angels as it were three thousand were saying hymns before me till I arrived at
the City of Christ. Moreover those who inhabited the City of Christ greatly rejoiced over
me as I went to them, and I entered and saw the City of Christ, and it was all of gold, and
twelve walls encircled it, and twelve interior towers, and each wall had between them single
stadia in the circuit: And I said to the angel, Sir, how much is a stadium? The angel answered
and said to me: As much as there is between the Lord God and the men who are on the
earth, for the City of Christ is alone great. And there were twelve gates in the circuit of the
city, of great beauty, and four rivers which encircled it. There was, moreover, a river of
honey and a river of milk, and a river of wine and a river of oil. And I said to the angel:
<note type="footnote">3914 (In Syriac, but not in Greek version.)</note>
<note type="footnote">3915 The Greek has not the golden ship, the angels or the walls. They are given in the Syriac.</note>
    
<pb n="320"/>
What are these rivers surrounding that city? And he saith to me: These are the four rivers
which flow sufficiently for those who are in this land of promise, of which the names3916
are: the river of honey is called Fison, and the river of milk Euphrates, and the river of oil
Gion, and the river of wine Tigris, such therefore they are for those who when placed in the
world did not use the power of these things, but they hungered for these things and afflicted
themselves for the sake of the Lord God: so that when these enter into this city, the Lord
will assign them these things on high above all measure.</p>
<p>24. I indeed entering the gates saw trees great and very high before the doors of the
city, having no fruit but leaves only, and I saw a few men scattered in the midst of the trees,
and they lamented greatly when they saw anyone enter the city. And those trees were sorry
for them and humbled themselves and bowed down and again erected themselves. And I
saw and wept with them and I asked the angel and said: Sir, who are these who are not admitted
to enter into the City of Christ? And he said to me: These are they who zealously
abstained day and night in fasts, but they had a proud heart above other men, glorifying
and praising themselves and doing nothing for their neighbours. For they gave some friendly
greeting, but to others they did not even say hail! and indeed they shewed hospitality to
those only whom they wished, and if they did anything whatever for their neighbour they
were immoderately puffed up. And I said: What then, Sir? Did their pride prevent them
from entering into the City of Christ? And the angel answered and said unto me: Pride is
the root of all evils. Are they better than the Son of God who came to the Jews with much
humility? And I asked him and said: Why is it that the trees humble themselves and erect
themselves again? And the angel answered and said to me: The whole time which these
men passed on earth zealously serving God, on account of the confusion and reproaches of
men at the time, they blushed and humiliated themselves, but they were not saddened. nor
did they repent that they should recede from their pride which was in them. This is why
the trees humble themselves, and again are raised up. And I asked and said: For what cause
were they admitted to the doors of the city? The angel answered and said unto me: Because
of the great goodness of God, and because there is the entry of his holy men entering into
this city: for this cause they are left in this place, but when Christ the King Eternal enters
with his saints, as he enters just men may pray for these, and then they may enter into the
city along with them: but yet none of them is able to have assurance such as they have who
humbled themselves, serving the Lord God all their lives.</p>
<p>25. But I went on while the angel instructed me, and he carried me to the river of honey,
and I saw there Isaiah and Jeremiah3917 and Ezekiel and Amos, and Micah and Zechariah,
the minor and major prophets, and they saluted me in the city. I said to the angel: What
<note type="footnote">3916 Not in the Greek, but given in the Syriac. Cf. Genesis ii. 11 ff.</note>
<note type="footnote">3917 Names not in the Greek. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Moses and all the Prophets in the Syriac.</note>
    
<pb n="321"/>
way is this? And he said to me: This is the way of the prophets, every one who shall have
afflicted his soul and not done his own will because of God, when he shall have gone out of
the world and have been led to the Lord God and adored him, then by the command of God
he is handed over to Michael, and he leads him into the city to this place of the prophets,
and they salute him as their friend and neighbour because he did the will of God.</p>
<p>26. Again he led me where there is a river of milk, and I saw in that place all the infants
whom Herod slew because of the name of Christ, and they saluted me, and the angel said
to me: All who keep their chastity with purity, when they shall have come out of the body,
after they adore the Lord God are delivered to Michael and are led to the infants and they
salute them, saying that they are our brothers and friends and members; in themselves they
shall inherit the promises of God.</p>
<p>27. Again he took me up and carried me to the north of the city and led me where there
was a river of wine, and there I saw Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, Lot and Job and other
saints,3918 and they saluted me: and I asked and said: What is this place, my Lord? The
angel answered and said to me: All who are receivers of pilgrims, when they go out of the
world, first adore the Lord God, and are delivered to Michael and by this way are led into
the city, and all the just salute him as son and brother, and say unto him: Because thou hast
observed humanity and the receiving of pilgrims, come, have an inheritance in the city of
the Lord our God: every just man shall receive good things of God in the city, according to
his own action.</p>
<p>28. And again he carried me near the river of oil on the east of the city. And I saw there
men rejoicing and singing psalms, and I said: Who are those, my Lord? And the angel saith
to me: Those are they who devoted themselves to God with their whole heart and had no
pride in themselves. For all those who rejoice in the Lord God and sing psalms to the Lord
with their whole heart are here led into this city.</p>
<p>29. And he carried me into the midst of the city near the twelve walls.3919 But there
was in this place a higher wall, and I asked and said: Is there in the City of Christ a wall
which in honour exceeds this place? And the angel answering said to me: There is a second
better than the first, and similarly a third than the second, as each exceeds the other, unto
the twelfth wall. And I said: Tell me, Sir, why one exceeds another in glory? And the angel
answered and said unto me: All who have in themselves even a little detraction or zeal or
pride, something of his glory would be made void even if he were in the city of Christ: look
backward!</p>
<p>And turning round I saw golden thrones placed in each gate, and on them men having
golden diadems and gems:3920 and I looked carefully and I saw inside between the twelve
<note type="footnote">3918 Names not in the Greek or Syriac.</note>
<note type="footnote">3919 Not in Greek, which here has the altar in the city and David. The Syriac is the same as the Latin.</note>
<note type="footnote">3920 Not in the Greek. Cf. Ascension of Isaiah viii. 36.</note>
    
<pb n="322"/>
men thrones placed in another rank which appeared of much glory, so that no one is able
to recount their praise. And I asked the angel and said: My lord, who is on the throne?
And the angel answered and said unto me: Those thrones belong to those who had goodness
and understanding of heart and made themselves fools for the sake of the Lord God, nor
knew new Scriptures nor psalms, but, mindful of one chapter of the commands of God, and
hearing what it contained they wrought thereby in much diligence and had a right zeal before
the Lord God, and the admiration of them will seize all the saints in presence of the Lord
God, for talking with one another they say, Wait and see the unlearned who know nothing
more: by which means they merited so great and such a garment and so great glory on account
of their innocence.</p>
<p>And I saw in the midst of this city a great altar, very high, and there was one standing
near the altar whose countenance shone as the sun, and he held in his hands a psaltery and
harp, and he sang psalms, saying Halleluia! And his voice filled the whole city: at the same
time when all they who were on the towers and gates heard him they responded Halleluia!
so that the foundations of the city were shaken: and I asked the angel and said, Sir, who is
this of so great power? And the angel said to me: This is David: this is the city of Jerusalem,
for when Christ the King of Eternity shall come with the assurance of His kingdom, he again
shall go before him that he may sing psalms, and all the just at the same time shall sing
psalms responding Halleluia! And I said, Sir, how did David alone above the other saints
make a beginning of psalm-singing? And the angel answered and said unto me: Because
Christ the Son of God sits at the right hand of His Father, and this David sings psalms before
him in the seventh heaven, and as is done in the heavens so also below, because the host
may not be offered to God without David, but it is necessary that David should sing psalms
in the hour of the oblation of the body and blood of Christ: as it is performed in heaven so
also on earth.</p>
<p>30. And I said to the angel: Sir, what is Alleluia? And the angel answered and said to
me: You ask questions about everything. And he said to me, Alleluia is said in the Hebrew
language of God and angels, for the meaning of Alleluia is this: tecel cat. marith macha.3921
And I said, Sir, what is tecel cat. marith macha? And the angel answered and said unto me:
Tecel cat. marith macha is: Let us all bless him together. I asked the angel and said, Sir, do
all who say Alleluia bless the Lord? And the angel answered and said to me: It is so, and
again, therefore, if any one sing Alleluia and those who are present do not sing at the same
time, they commit sin because they do not sing along with him. And I said: My lord, does
he also sin if he be hesitating or very old? The angel answered and said unto me: Not so,
<note type="footnote">3921 These letters are unintelligible. In the Greek version, the interpretation of Alleluia is given as thebel
marematha, which is also unintelligible. In the Syriac the interpretation of Alleluia is correctly given.</note>
    
<pb n="323"/>
but he who is able and does not join in the singing, know such as a despiser of the Word,
and it would be proud and unworthy that he should not bless the Lord God his maker.</p>
<p>31. Moreover when he had ceased speaking to me, he led me outside the city through
the midst of the trees and far from the places of the land of the good, and put me across the
river of milk and honey: and after that he led me over the ocean which supports the
foundations of heaven.</p>
<p>The angel answered and said unto me: Dost thou understand why thou goest hence?
And I said: Yes, sir. And he said to me: Come and follow me, and I will show thee the souls
of the impious and sinners, that thou mayest know what manner of place it is. And I proceeded
with the angel and he carried me by the setting of the sun, and I saw the beginning
of heaven founded on a great river of water, and I asked: What is this river of water? And
he said to me: This is Ocean which surrounds all the Earth. And when I was at the outer
limit of Ocean I looked, and there was no light in that place, but darkness and sorrow and
sadness: and I sighed.</p>
<p>And I saw there a fervent river of fire, and in it a multitude of men and women immersed
up to the knees, and other men up to the navel, others even up to the lips, others moreover
up to the hair. And I asked the angel and said: Sir, who are those in the fiery river? And
the angel answered and said to me: They are neither hot nor cold, because they were found
neither in the number of the just nor in the number of the impious.3922 For those spent
the time of their life on earth passing some days in prayer, but others in sins and fornications,
until their death. And I asked him and said: Who are these, Sir, immersed up to their knees
in fire? He answered and said to me: These are they who when they have gone out of church
throw themselves into strange conversations to dispute. Those indeed who are immersed
up to the navel are those who, when they have taken the body and blood of Christ go and
fornicate and did not cease from their sins till they died. Those who are immersed up to
the lips are the detractors of each other when they assemble in the church of God: those up
to the eyebrows are those who nod approval of themselves and plot spite against their
neighbour.3923</p>
<p>32. And I saw on the north a place of various and diverse punishments full of men and
women,3924 and a river of fire ran down into it. Moreover I observed and I saw pits great
in depth, and in them several souls together, and the depth of that place was as it were three

<pb n="324"/>
thousand cubits, and I saw them groaning and weeping and saying: Have pity on us, O
Lord! and none had pity on them. And I asked the angel and said: Who are these, Sir? And
the angel answered and said unto me: These are they who did not hope in the Lord, that
they would be able to have him as their helper. And I asked and said: Sir, if these souls remain
for thirty or forty generations thus one upon another, if they were sent deeper, the
pits I believe would not hold them. And he said to me: The Abyss has no measure, for
beyond3925 this it stretches down below him who is down in it: and so it is, that if perchance
anyone should take a stone and throw it into a very deep well and after many hours it should
reach the bottom, such is the abyss. For when the souls are thrown in there, they hardly
reach the bottom in fifty years.</p>
<p>33. I, indeed, when I heard this, wept and groaned over the human race. The angel
answered and said unto me: Why dost thou weep? Art thou more pitiful than God? For
though God is good, He knows also that there are punishments, and He patiently bears with
the human race, dismissing each one to work his own will in the time in which he dwells
on the earth.</p>
<p>34. I further observed the fiery river and saw there a man being tortured by Tartaruchian
angels having in their hands an iron with three hooks with which they pierced the bowels
of that old man: and I asked the angel, and said: Sir, who is that old man on whom such
torments are imposed? And the angel answered and said to me: He whom you see was a
presbyter who did not perform well his ministry: when he had been eating and drinking
and committing fornication he offered the host to the Lord at his holy altar.</p>
<p>35. And I saw not far away another old man led on by malign angels running with
speed, and they pushed him into the fire up to his knees, and they struck him with stones
and wounded his face like a storm, and did not allow him to say: Have pity on me! And I
asked the angel and he said to me: He whom you see was a bishop, and did not perform
well his episcopate, who indeed accepted the great name but did not enter into the witness
of him who gave him the name in all his life, seeing that he did not do just judgment, and
did not pity widows and orphans, but now he receives retribution according to his iniquity
and his works.</p>
<p>36. And I saw another man in the fiery river up to his knees. Moreover his hands were
stretched out and bloody, and worms proceeded from his mouth and nostrils and he was
groaning and weeping, and crying he said: Have pity on me! for I am hurt above the rest
who are in this punishment. And I asked, Sir, who is this? And he said to me: This man
whom thou seest, was a deacon who devoured the oblations and committed fornications
and did not right in the sight of God, for this cause he unceasingly pays this penalty.</p>

<pb n="325"/>
<p>And I looked closely and saw alongside of him another3926 man whom they delivered
up with haste and cast into the fiery river, and he was (in it) up to the knees: and there came
the angel who was set over the punishments having a great fiery razor, and with it he cut
the lips of that man and the tongue likewise. And sighing, I lamented and asked: Who is
that, sir. And he said to me, He whom thou seest was a reader and read to the people, but
he himself did not keep the precepts of God: now he also pays the proper penalty.</p>
<p>37. And I saw another multitude of pits in the same place, and in the midst of it a river
full of a multitude of men and women,3927 and worms3928 consumed them. But I lamented
and sighing asked the angel and said: Sir, who are these? And he said to me: These are
those who exacted interest3929 on interest and trusted in their riches and did not hope in
God that He was their helper.</p>
<p>And after that I looked and saw another place, very narrow, and it was like a wall, and
fire round about it. And I saw inside men and women gnawing3930 their tongues, and I
asked: Sir, who are these. And he said to me: These are they who in church disparage the
Word of God, not attending to it, but as it were make naught of God and His angels: for
that cause they now likewise pay the proper penalty.</p>
<p>38. And I observed and saw another old man down in a pit and his countenance was
like blood, and I asked and said, Sir, what is this place? And he said to me: Into that pit
stream all the punishments. And I saw men and women immersed up to the lips and I
asked, Sir, who are these? And he said to me: These are the magicians who prepared for
men and women evil magic arts and did not find how to stop them till they died.</p>
<p>And again I saw men and women with very black faces in a pit of fire,3931 and I sighed
and lamented and asked, Sir, who are these? And he said to me: These are fornicators and
adulterers who committed adultery having wives of their own: likewise also the women
committed adultery having husbands of their own: therefore they unceasingly suffer penalties.</p>
<p>39. And I saw there girls having black3932 raiment, and four terrible angels having in
their hands burning chains, and they put them on the necks of the girls and led them into
darkness: and I, again weeping, asked the angel: Who are these, Sir? And he said to me:

These are they who, when they were virgins, defiled their virginity unknown to their parents;
for which cause they unceasingly pay the proper penalties.</p>
<p>And again I observed there men and women with hands cut and their feet placed naked
in a place of ice and snow, and worms devoured them. But seeing them I lamented and
asked: Sir, who are these? And he said to me: These are they who harmed orphans and
widows and the poor,3933 and did not hope in the Lord, for which cause they unceasingly
pay the proper penalties.</p>
<p>And I observed and saw others hanging over a channel of water, and their tongues were
very dry, and many fruits were placed in their sight, and they were not permitted to take of
them, and I asked: Sir, who are these? And he said to me: These are they who break their
fast3934 before the appointed hour, for this cause they unceasingly pay these penalties.</p>
<p>And I saw other men and women hanging by their eyebrows and their hair,3935 and a
fiery river drew them, and I said: Who are these, my Lord? And he said to me:3936 These
are they who join themselves not to their own husbands and wives but to whores, and
therefore they unceasingly pay the proper penalties.
And I saw other men and women covered with dust, and their countenance was like
blood, and they were in a pit of pitch and sulphur and running down into a fiery river, and
I asked: Sir, who are these?3937 And he said to me: These are they who committed the
iniquity of Sodom and Gomorrah, the male with the male, for which reason they unceasingly
pay the penalties.</p>
<p>40. And3938 I observed and saw men and women clothed in bright garments, having
their eyes blind, placed in a pit, and I asked: Sir, who are these? And he said to me: These
are of the people who did alms, and knew not the Lord God, for which reason they unceasingly
pay the proper penalties. And I observed and saw other men and women on an obelisk
of fire, and beasts tearing them in pieces, and they were not allowed to say, Lord have pity
on us! And I saw the angel3939 of penalties putting heavy punishments on them and saying:
Acknowledge the Son of God; for this was predicted to you, when the divine Scriptures were
read to you, and you did not attend; for which cause God’s judgment is just, for your actions
have apprehended you and brought you into these penalties. But I sighed and wept, and I
asked and said: Who are these men and women who are strangled in fire and pay their

penalties? And he answered me: These are women who defiled the image of God when
bringing forth infants out of the womb, and these are the men who lay with them. And
their infants addressed the Lord God and the angels who were set over the punishments,
saying:3940 Cursed be the hour to our parents, for they defiled the image of God, having
the name of God but not observing His precepts: they gave us for food to dogs and to be
trodden down of swine: others they threw into the river. But their infants3941 were handed
over to the angels of Tartarus who were set over the punishments, that they might lead them
to a wide place of mercy: but their fathers and mothers were tortured in a perpetual punishment.</p>
<p>And after that I saw men and women clothed with rags full of pitch and fiery sulphur,
and dragons were coiled about their necks and shoulders and feet, and angels having fiery
horns restrained them and smote them, and closed their nostrils, saying to them: Why did
ye not know the time in which it was right to repent and serve God, and did not do it? And
I asked: Sir, who are these? And he said to me: These are they who seem to give up the
world for God,3942 putting on our garb, but the impediments of the world made them
wretched, not maintaining agapæ, and they did not pity widows and orphans: they did not
receive the stranger and the pilgrim, nor did they offer the oblations, and they did not pity
their neighbour. Moreover their prayer did not even on one day ascend pure to the Lord
God, but many impediments of the world detained them, and they were not able to do right
in the sight of God, and the angels enclosed them in the place of punishments. Moreover
they saw those who were in punishments and said to them: We indeed when we lived in
the world neglected God, and ye also did likewise: as we also truly when we were in the
world knew that ye were sinners. But ye said: These are just and servants of God, now we
know why ye were called by the name of the Lord: for which cause they also pay their own
penalties.</p>
<p>And sighing I wept and said: Woe unto men, woe unto sinners! why were they born?
And the angel answered and said unto me: Why dost thou lament?3943 Art thou more pitiful
than the Lord God who is blessed forever, who established judgment and sent forth
every man to choose good and evil in his own will and do what pleases him? Then I
lamented again very greatly, and he said to me: Dost thou lament when as yet thou hast not
seen greater punishments? Follow me and thou shalt see seven times greater than these.</p>
<p>41. And he carried me south and placed me above a well, and I found it sealed with
seven seals: and answering, the angel who was with me said to the angel of that place: Open

the mouth of the well that Paul, the well-beloved of God, may see, for authority is given him
that he may see all the pains of hell. And the angel said to me: Stand afar off that thou
mayest be able to bear the stench of this place. When therefore the well was opened, immediately
there arose from it a certain hard and malign stench, which surpasses all punishments:
and I looked into the well and I saw fiery masses glowing in every part, and narrow places,
and the mouth of the well was narrow so as to admit one man only. And the angel answered
and said unto me: If any man shall have been put into this well of the abyss and it shall have
been sealed over him, no remembrance of him shall ever be made in the sight of the Father
and His Son and the holy angels. And I said: Who are these, Sir, who are put into this well?
And he said to me: They are whoever shall not confess that Christ has come in the flesh
and that the Virgin Mary brought him forth, and whoever says that the bread and cup of
the Eucharist of blessing are not this body and blood of Christ.</p>
<p>42. And I looked to the south in the west and I saw there a3944 restless worm and in
that place there was gnashing of teeth: moreover the worms were one cubit long, and had
two heads, and there I saw men and women in cold and gnashing of teeth. And I asked and
said, Sir, who are these in this place? And he said to me: These are they who say that Christ
did not rise from the dead and that this flesh will not rise again. And I asked and said: Sir,
is there no fire nor heat in this place? And he said to me: In this place there is nothing else
but cold and snow:3945 and again he said to me: Even if the sun should rise upon them,
they do not become warm on account of the superabundant cold of that place and the snow.
But hearing these things I stretched out my hands and wept, and sighing again, I said:
It were better for us if we had not been born,3946 all of us who are sinners.</p>
<p>43. But when those who were in the same place saw me weeping with the angel, they
themselves cried out and wept saying, Lord God have mercy upon us! And after these things
I saw the heavens open, and Michael3947 the archangel descending from heaven, and with
him was the whole army of angels, and they came to those who were placed in punishment
and seeing him, again weeping, they cried out and said, Have pity on us! Michael the
archangel, have pity on us and on the human race, for on account of thy prayers the earth
standeth. We now see the judgment and acknowledge the Son of God! It was impossible
for us before these things to pray for this, before we entered into this place: for we heard
that there was a judgment before we went out of the world, but impediments and the life of
the world did not allow us to repent. And Michael answered and said: Hear Michael
speaking! I am he who stands in the sight of God every hour: As the Lord liveth, in whose

sight I stand, I do not intermit one day or one night praying incessantly for the human race,
and I indeed pray for those who are on the earth: but they do not cease doing iniquity and
fornications, and they do not bring to me any good while they are placed on earth: and ye
have consumed in vanity the time in which ye ought to have repented. But I have always
prayed thus and I now beseech that God may send dew and send forth rains upon the earth,
and now I desire until the earth produce its fruits and verily I say, that if any have done but
a little good, I will agonise for him, protecting him till he have escaped the judgment of
penalties. Where therefore are your prayers? Where are your penances? Ye have lost your
time contemptuously. But now weep and I will weep with you and the angels who are with
me with the well-beloved Paul, if perchance the merciful God will have pity and give you
refreshment. But hearing these words they cried out and wept greatly, and all said with one
voice: Have pity on us, Son of God! And I, Paul, sighed and said: O Lord God! have pity
on thy creature, have pity on the sons of men, have pity on thine image.</p>
<p>44. And I looked and saw the heaven move like a tree shaken by the wind. Suddenly,
moreover, they threw themselves on their faces in the sight of the throne. And I saw twentyfour
elders and twenty-four thousand adoring God, and I saw an altar and veil and throne,
and all were rejoicing; and the smoke of a good odour was raised near the altar of the throne
of God, and I heard the voice of one saying: For the sake of what do ye our angels and
ministers intercede? And they cried out saying: We intercede seeing thy many kindnesses
to the human race. And after these things I saw the Son of God descending from heaven,
and a diadem was on his head. And seeing him those who were placed in punishment exclaimed
all with one voice saying: Have pity, Son of the High God! Thou art He who
shewest refreshment for all in the heavens and on earth, and on us likewise have pity, for
since we have seen Thee, we have refreshment. And a voice went out from the Son of God
through all the punishments saying: And what work have ye done that ye demand refreshment
from me? My blood was poured out for your sakes, and not even so did ye repent:
for your sakes I wore the crown of thorns on my head: for you I received buffets on my
cheeks, and not even so did ye repent. I asked water when hanging on the cross and they
gave me vinegar mixed with gall, with a spear they opened my right side, for my name’s
sake they slew my prophets and just men, and in all these things I gave you a place of repentance
and ye would not. Now, however, for the sake of Michael the archangel of my covenant
and the angels who are with him, and because of Paul the well-beloved, whom I would not
vex, for the sake of your brethren who are in the world and offer oblations, and for the sake
of your sons, because my precepts are in them, and more for the sake of mine own kindness,
on the day on which I rose from the dead, I give to you all who are in punishment a night
and a day of refreshment forever. And they all cried out and said, We bless thee, Son of
God, that Thou hast given us a night and a day of respite. For better to us is a refreshment
of one day above all the time of our life which we were on earth, and if we had plainly known

<pb n="331"/>
that this was intended for those who sin, we would have worked no other work, we would
have done no business, and we would have done no iniquity: what need had we for pride
in the world? For here our pride is crushed which ascended from our mouth against our
neighbour: our plagues and excessive straitness and the tears and the worms which are
under us, these are much worse to us than the pains which we have left behind us. When
they said thus, the malign angels of the penalties were angered with them, saying: How long
do ye lament and sigh? for ye had no pity. For this is the judgment of God who had no pity.
But ye received this great grace of a day and a night’s refreshment on the Lord’s Day for the
sake of Paul the well-beloved of God who descended to you.</p>
<p>45. And after that the angel said to me: Hast thou seen all these things? And I said:
Yes, Sir. And he said to me: Follow me and I will lead thee into Paradise, that the just who
are there may see thee, for lo! they hope to see thee, and they are ready to come to meet thee
in joy and gladness. And I followed the angel by the impulse of the Holy Spirit, and he
placed me in Paradise and said to me: This is Paradise in which Adam and his wife erred.
Moreover I entered Paradise and saw the beginning of waters, and there was an angel
making a sign to me and he said to me: Observe, said he, the waters, for this is the river of
Physon which surrounds all the land of Evilla, and the second is Geon which surrounds all
the land of Egypt and Ethiopia, and the third is Thigris which is over against the Assyrians,
and another is Eufrates which waters all the land of Mesopotamia. And when I had gone
inside I saw a tree planted from whose roots water flowed out, and from this beginning there
were four rivers. And the spirit of God rested on that tree, and when the Spirit blew, the
waters flowed forth, and I said: My Lord, is it this tree itself which makes the waters flow?
And he said to me: That from the beginning, before the heavens and earth were manifested,
and all things here invisible, the Spirit of God was borne upon the waters, but from the time
when the command of God made the heavens and earth to appear, the Spirit rested upon
this tree: wherefore whenever the Spirit blows, the waters flow forth from the tree. And he
held me by the hand and led me near the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and he said:
This is the tree by which death entered into the world, and receiving of it through his wife
Adam ate and death entered into the world. And he shewed me another tree in the midst
of Paradise, and saith to me: This is the tree of life.</p>
<p>46. While I was yet looking upon the tree, I saw a virgin coming from afar and two
hundred angels before her saying hymns, and I asked and said: Sir, who is she who comes
in so great glory? And he said to me: This is Mary the Virgin, the Mother of the Lord. And
coming near she saluted me and said: Hail, Paul! well-beloved of God and angels and men.
For all the saints prayed my Son Jesus who is my Lord that thou mightest come hither in
the body that they might see thee before thou goest out of the world. And the Lord said to
them: Bear and be patient: yet a little and ye shall see him and he shall be with you for ever:
and again they all said to him together: Do not vex us, for we desire to see him in the flesh,

<pb n="331"/>
for by him Thy name was greatly glorified in the world, and we have seen that he endured
all the labours whether of the greater or of the less. This we learn from those who come
hither. For when we say: Who is he who directed you in the world? they reply to us: There
is one in the world whose name is Paul, he preaches and announces Christ, and we believe
that many have entered into the kingdom through the virtue and sweetness of his speeches.
Behold all the just men are behind me coming to meet thee, Paul, and I first come for this
cause to meet them who did the will of my Son and my Lord Jesus Christ, I first advance to
meet them and do not send them away to be as wanderers until they meet in peace.</p>
<p>47. When she had thus spoken, I saw three coming from afar, very beautiful in the
likeness of Christ, and their forms were shining, and their angels, and I asked: Sir, who are
these? And he said to me: Dost thou not know those? And I said: No, Sir. And he
answered: These are the fathers of the people, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And coming
near they saluted me, and said: Hail, Paul, well-beloved of God and men; blessed is he who
suffers violence for the Lord’s sake. And Abraham answered me and said: This is my son
Isaac, and Jacob my well-beloved, and we have known the Lord and followed him; blessed
are all they who believed in thy word, that they may be able to inherit the Kingdom of God
by labour, by renunciation, and sanctification, and humility, and charity, and meekness,
and right faith in the Lord; and we also have had devotion to the Lord whom thou preachest
in the testament, that we might assist those who believed in him with their whole soul, and
might minister unto them as fathers minister to their children.
When they had thus spoken, I saw other twelve coming from afar in honour, and I
asked: Sir, who are these? And he said: These are the patriarchs. And coming near they
saluted me and said: Hail, Paul, well-beloved of God and men: the Lord did not vex us,
that we might see thee yet in the body, before thou goest out of the world. And each one of
them reminded me of his name in order, from Ruben to Benjamin: and Joseph said to me:
I am he who was sold; but I say to thee, Paul, that all the things, whatever my brothers did
to me, in nothing did I act maliciously with them, nor in all the labour which they imposed
on me, nor in any point was I hurt by them on that account from morning till evening:
blessed is he who receives some hurt on account of the Lord, and bears it, for the Lord will
repay it to him manifold, when he shall have gone out of the world.</p>
<p>48. When he had spoken thus far, I saw another beautiful one coming from afar, and
his angels saying hymns, and I asked: Sir, who is this that is beautiful of countenance? And
he saith to me: Dost thou not know him? And I said: No, Sir. And he said to me: This is
Moses the law-giver, to whom God gave the law. And when he had come near me, he immediately
wept, and after that he saluted me: and I said to him: What dost thou lament?
for I have heard that thou excellest every man in meekness. And he answered saying: I
weep for those whom I planted with toil, because they did not bear fruit, nor did any profit
by them; and I saw all the sheep whom I fed, that they were scattered and become as if they

<pb n="332"/>
had no shepherd, and because all the toils which I endured for the sake of the sons of Israel
were accounted as naught, and how greatsoever virtues I did in the midst of them these they
did not understand, and I wonder that strangers and uncircumcised and idol-worshippers
have been converted and have entered into the promises of God, but Israel has not entered;
and now I say unto thee, brother Paul, that in that hour when the people hanged Jesus whom
thou preachest, that the Father, the God of all, who gave me the law, and Michael and all
the angels and archangels, and Abraham and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the just wept over the
Son of God hanging on the cross. In that hour all the saints attended on me looking (upon
me) and they said to me: See, Moses, what men of thy people have done to the Son of God.
Wherefore thou art blessed, Paul, and blessed the generation and race which believed in thy
word.</p>
<p>49. When he had spoken thus far, there came other twelve, and seeing me said: Art
thou Paul the glorified in heaven and on earth? And I answered and said: What are ye?
The first answered and said: I am Esaias whom Manasses cut asunder with a wooden saw.
And the second said likewise: I am Jeremias who was stoned by the children of Israel and
slain. And the third said: I am Ezekiel whom the children of Israel dragged by the feet over
a rock in a mountain till they knocked out my brains, and we endured all these toils, wishing
to save the children of Israel: and I say unto thee that after the toils which they laid upon
me, I cast myself on my face in the sight of the Lord praying for them, bending my knees
until the second hour of the Lord’s day, till Michael came and lifted me up from the earth.
Blessed art thou, Paul, and blessed the nation which believed through thee.</p>
<p>And as these passed by, I saw another, beautiful of countenance, and I asked: Sir, Who
is this? Who when he had seen me, rejoiced and said to me: This is Lot3948 who was found
just in Sodom. And approaching3949 he saluted me and said: Blessed art thou, Paul, and
blessed the generation to which thou didst minister. And I answered and said to him: Art
thou Lot who wast found just in Sodom? And he said: I entertained angels, as travellers,
and when they of the city wished to violate them, I offered them my two virgin daughters
who had not yet known men, and gave them to them saying: use them as ye will, but only
to these men ye shall do no evil; for this cause they entered under the roof of my house. For
this cause, therefore, we ought to be confident and know that if anyone shall have done
anything, God shall repay him manifold when they shall come to him. Blessed art thou,
Paul, and blessed the nation which believed in thy word.
When, therefore, he had ceased talking to me, I saw another coming from a distance,
very beautiful of countenance, and smiling, and his angels saying hymns: and I said to the
angel who was with me: Has then each of the just an angel for companion? And he said to
<note type="footnote">3948 Lot and Job, in the Syriac but not in the Greek.</note>
<note type="footnote">3949 For adproprians read adpropinquans.</note>
    
<pb n="333"/>
me: Each one of the saints has his own (angel) assisting him, and saying a hymn, and the
one does not depart from the other. And I said: Who is this, Sir? And he said: This is Job.
And approaching, he saluted me and said: Brother Paul, thou hast great praise with God
and men. And I am Job, who laboured much for a period of thirty years from a plague in
the blood; and verily in the beginning, the wounds which went forth from my body were
like grains of wheat. But on the third day, they became as the foot of an ass; worms moreover
which fell four digits in length: and on the third (day) the devil appeared and said to me:
Say something against God and die. I said to him: If such be the will of God that I should
remain under a plague all the time of my life till I die, I shall not cease from blessing the
Lord, and I shall receive more reward. For I know that the labours of that world are nothing
to the refreshment which is afterwards: for which cause blessed art thou, Paul, and blessed
the nation which believed through thee.</p>
<p>50. When he had spoken thus far, another came calling from afar and saying: Blessed
art thou, Paul, and blessed am I because I saw thee, the beloved of the Lord. And I asked
the angel: Sir, who is this? And he answered and said unto me: This is Noe in the time of
the deluge. And immediately we saluted each other: and greatly rejoicing he said to me:
Thou art Paul the most beloved of God. And I asked him: Who art thou? And he said: I
am Noe, who was in the time of the deluge. And I say to thee, Paul, that working for a
hundred years, I made the ark, not putting off the tunic with which I was clad, nor did I cut
the hair of my head. Till then also I cherished continence, not approaching my own wife:
in those hundred years not a hair of my head grew in length, nor did my garments become
soiled: and I besought men at all times saying: Repent, for a deluge of waters will come
upon you. But they laughed at me, and mocked my words; and again they said to me: But
this is the time of those who are able to play and sin freely, desiring her with whom it is
possible to commit fornication frequently: for God does not regard this, and does not know
what things are done by us men, and there is no flood of waters straightway coming upon
this world. And they did not cease from their sins, till God destroyed all flesh which had
the breath of life in it. Know then that God loveth one just man more than all the world of
the impious. Wherefore, blessed art thou, Paul, and blessed is the nation which believes

<p>51. And turning round, I saw other just ones coming from afar, and I asked the angel:
Sir, who are those? And he answered me: These are Elias and Eliseus.3950 And they saluted
me: and I said to them: Who are ye? And one of them answered and said: I am Elias, the
prophet of God; I am Elias who prayed, and because of my word, the heaven did not rain
for three years and six months, on account of the unrighteousness of men. God is just and
true, who doeth the will of his servants: for the angels often besought the Lord for rain, and

he said: Be patient till my servant Elias shall pray and petition for this and I will send rain
on the earth.3951</p>
<p>The End of the Vision of Saint Paul.</p>
<note type="footnote">3951 The Latin version here breaks off abruptly, as does also the Greek. In the Syriac as translated by the Rev.
J. Perkins, D.D. (cf. Journal of Sacred Literature, N. S., vi., 1865, p. 399), the narrative runs as follows: “And often
the angels asked that he would give them rain, and he gave not, until I called upon him again; then he gave unto
them. But blessed art thou, O Paul, that thy generation, and those thou teachest, are the sons of the Kingdom.
And know thou, O Paul, that every man who believes through thee hath a great blessing, and a blessing is reserved
for him.” Then he departed from me. And the angel who was with me led me forth, and said unto me: “Lo,
unto thee is given this mystery and revelation; as thou pleasest, make it known unto the sons of men.” And I,
Paul, returned unto myself, and I knew all that I had seen; and in life I had not rest that I might reveal this
mystery, but I wrote it and deposited it under the ground and the foundation of a certain faithful man with
whom I used to be, in Tarsus, a city of Cilicia. And when I was released from this life of time and stood before
my Lord, thus said He unto me: “Paul, have we shown all these things unto thee, that thou shouldst deposit
them under the foundation of a house? Then send, and disclose, concerning this Revelation that men may read
it, and turn to the way of truth, that they also may not come to these bitter torments.” Then follows the story of
the discovery of the Revelation at Tarsus in the reign of Theodosius as given at the beginning of the Greek and
Latin versions.</note>

<head>Introduction.</head>
    
<p>The present translation of this Apocalypse3952 is made from the text as published by
Mr. M. R. James in Texts and Studies, ii., 3, from a ms. in the Bodleian Library, which he
assigns to the eleventh century. The original he conjecturally assigns to the ninth century,
and regards it as a late and clumsy compilation based on (1) the Assumption Legends and
(2) the Apocalypse of Paul. Its main feature, intercession for the lost, it has in common
with the Testament of Abraham, the Apocalypse of Paul, 4 Esdras, the Apocalypse of Baruch,
the Apocalypse of Esdras and the Apocalypse of Sedrach. Parallels are pointed out in the
notes.</p>
<note type="footnote">3952 In this Apocalypse and that of Sedrach which follows, the text is in many places so obviously corrupt
that the translator cannot be confident that he has given the correct meaning of the original in all cases.—A.R.</note>

<head>The Apocalypse of the Holy Mother of God Concerning
the Chastisements.</head>
<p>I. The all-holy mother of God was about to proceed to the Mount of Olives to pray;
and praying to the Lord our God she said: In the name of the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit; let the archangel Gabriel descend, that he may tell me concerning the chastisements
and concerning things in heaven and on the earth and under the earth. And as she
said the word the archangel Michael descended with the angels of the East and the West
and angels of the South and the North, and they saluted the highly favoured one and said
to her: Hail, reflection of the Father, hail dwelling of the Son, hail command of the Holy
Spirit, hail firmament of the seven heavens, hail firmament of the eleven strongholds, hail
worship of the angels, hail loftier than the prophets unto the throne of God. And the holy
mother of God said to the angel: Hail Michael, commander-in-chief, the minister of the
invisible Father, hail Michael, commander-in-chief, associate of my Son, hail Michael,
commander-in-chief, most dread of the six-winged, hail Michael, commander-in-chief,
who rules through all things and art worthy to stand beside the throne of the Lord, hail
Michael, commander-in-chief, who art about to sound the trumpet and awaken those who
have been asleep for ages: hail Michael, commander-in-chief, first of all unto the throne of
God.</p>
<p>II. And having greeted all the angels in like manner, the highly favoured one prayed
the commander-in-chief regarding the chastisements, saying: Tell to me all things on the
earth. And the commander-in-chief said to her: If thou askest me, highly favoured one, I
will tell thee. And the highly favoured one said to him: How many are the chastisements
with which the race of man is chastised? And the archangel said to her: The chastisements
are innumerable. And the highly favoured one said to him: Tell me the things in heaven
and on the earth.</p>
<p>III. Then the commander-in-chief, Michael, commanded the Western angels that revelation
should be made, and Hades opened, and she saw those who were chastised3953 in
Hades: and there lay there a multitude of men and women, and there was a great lamentation.
And the highly favoured one asked the commander-in-chief: Who are these and what
is their sin? And the commander-in-chief said: These, all holy, are those who did not
worship the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and for this cause they are thus chastised
here.</p>
<note type="footnote">3953 Cf. Vision of Paul, 31.</note>
    
<pb n="337"/>
<p>IV. And she saw in another place3954 a great darkness: and the all holy said: What is
this darkness and who are they who are being chastised? And the commander-in-chief
said: Many souls are lying in this darkness. And the all holy one said: Let this darkness be
taken away in order that I may see this chastisement also. And the commander-in-chief
said to the highly favoured one: It is not possible, all holy, that thou shouldst see this chastisement
also. And the angels guarding them answered and said: We have a command
from the invisible Father that they shall not see the light till thy blessed Son shall shine forth.
And plunged in grief the all holy lifted up her eyes to the angels touching the undefiled word
of the Father, and said: In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit let the
darkness be taken away, that I may see this chastisement also. And straightway that darkness
was lifted up and covered the seven heavens: and there lay a great multitude of both men
and women, and there arose a great lamentation and a great cry began. And seeing them
the all holy wept and said to them: What are ye doing, wretched ones? Who are ye? And
how are ye found there? and there was no voice or hearkening. And the angels guarding
them said: Why do ye not speak to the highly favoured one? And those who were under
chastisement said to her: O highly favoured one, from eternity we see not the light, and we
are not able to keep off that up there. And splashing pitch flowed down upon them: and
seeing them the all holy wept. And again those who were being chastised said to her: How
dost thou ask concerning us, holy lady, Mother of God? Thy blessed Son came to The earth
and did not make enquiry concerning us, neither Abraham the patriarch, nor John the
Baptist, nor Moses the great prophet, nor the Apostle Paul, and unto us their light shone
not: and now, all holy Mother of God, the armour of the Christians, the bringer of great
comfort on account of the Christians, how dost thou ask concerning us? Then the all holy
Mother of God said to Michael, the commander-in-chief: What is their sin? And Michael,
the commander-in-chief, said: These are they who did not believe in the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit, and did not confess thee3955 to be the Mother of God, and that the
Lord Jesus Christ was born of thee and took flesh, and for this cause they are chastised there.
And again weeping, the all holy Mother of God said to them: Why did ye so greatly err,
wretched ones? Did ye not hear that the whole creation names my name? And having said
these words the darkness fell over them as it was from the beginning.</p>
<p>V. And the commander-in-chief said: Whither wouldst thou go, highly favoured one?
to the West or to the South? And the highly favoured answered: Let us go to the South.
And immediately there appeared the cherubim and the seraphim and four hundred angels,
and led out the highly favoured one to the South, where came out the river of fire,3956 and

<pb n="338"/>
there there lay a multitude of men and women, some up to the girdle, others up to the neck,
and others up to the crown of the head: and seeing them the all holy Mother of God cried
out with a loud voice to the commander-in-chief and said: Who are these, and what is their
sin who stand in the fire up to the girdle? And the commander-in-chief said: These, all
holy one, are they who inherited the curse of father and mother, and for this cause they are
thus chastised here as accursed.</p>
<p>VI. And the all holy one said: And who are these standing in the fire up to the breasts?
And the commander-in-chief said: These are whosoever cast off their wives and defiled
them in adultery, and for this cause they are thus chastised here.</p>
<p>VII. And the all holy one said to the commander-in-chief: Who are these standing up
to the neck in the flame of the fire? And the commander-in-chief said: These, all holy one,
are whosoever ate of the flesh of men. And the all holy one said: And how is it possible for
one man to eat of the flesh of another? And the commander-in-chief said: Listen, all holy
one, and I will tell thee: These are they whosoever brought down their own children out of
their own wombs and cast them out3957 as food for dogs, and whosoever gave up their
brothers in the presence of kings and governors, these ate the flesh of man, and for this
cause they are thus chastised.</p>
<p>VIII. And the all holy one said: Who are these set in the fire up to the crown? And the
commander-in-chief said: These, all holy one, are whosoever lay hold of the precious cross
and swear to a lie: by the power of the cross of the Lord. The angels tremble and worship
with fear, and men lay hold of it and swear to a lie and do not know what they testify: and
for this cause they are thus chastised here.</p>
<p>IX. And in another place the all holy one saw a man hung by the feet,3958 and worms
devoured him. And she asked the commander-in-chief: Who is this and what is his sin?
And the commander-in-chief said: This is he who took usury3959 for his gold, and for this
cause he is thus chastised here.</p>
<p>X. And she saw a woman hanging by her two ears, and all the beasts3960 came out of
her mouth and gnawed her in pieces: and the highly favoured one asked the commanderin-
chief: Who is she, and what is her sin? And the commander-in-chief said: She is she
who turned aside into strange houses and those of her neighbours and spoke evil words to
make strife, and for that cause she is thus chastised here.</p>

<p>XI. And seeing these things the all holy Mother of God wept and said to the commander-
in-chief: It were well for man that he had not been born. And the commander-in-chief
said: Verily, all holy one, thou hast not seen the great chastisements. And the all holy one
said to the commander-in-chief: Come, Michael, great commander-in-chief, and lead me
that I may see all the chastisements. And the commander-in-chief said: Where dost thou
wish, all holy one, that we should go? And the highly favoured one answered: To the West:
and straightway the cherubim appeared and led the highly favoured to the West.</p>
<p>XII. And she saw a cloud full of fire and in it there was a3961 multitude of men and
women. And the all holy one said: What was their sin? And the commander-in-chief said:
These, all holy one, are they who on the morning of the Lord’s day sleep like the dead, and
for that reason they are thus chastised here. And the all holy one said: If anyone cannot
rise, what shall he do? And the commander-in-chief said: Listen, all holy one: if anyone’s
house is fastened on the four (sides?) and surrounds him and he cannot come out, he has
forgiveness.</p>
<p>XIII. And she saw in another place burning benches of fire and on them sat a multitude
of men and women and burned on them. And the all holy one asked: Who are these and
what is their sin? And the commander-in-chief said: These, all holy one, are they who do
not rise up to the presbyter when they enter into the church of God, and for this cause they
are thus chastised here.</p>
<p>XIV. And the all holy one saw in another place an iron tree and it had branches of iron,
and on it there hung a multitude of men and women by their tongues.3962 And seeing them
the all holy one wept, and asked the commander-in-chief saying: Who are these and what
was their sin? And the commander-in-chief said: These are perjurers, blasphemers, slanderers,
whosoever divided brothers from brothers. And the all holy one said: How is it
possible to divide brothers from brothers? And the commander-in-chief said: Listen, all
holy one, and I will tell thee about this: When some from among the nations desired to be
baptised, he would say to them one word: Thou foul-feeding, unbelieving Gentile; because
he thus blasphemed, he shall receive ceaseless retribution.</p>
<p>XV. And in another place the all holy one saw a man hanging from his four extremities,
and from his nails blood gushed vehemently, and his tongue3963 was tied in a flame of fire,
and he was unable to groan and say the Kyrie eleïson me. And when she had seen him the
all holy one wept and herself said the Kyrie eleïson thrice: and after the saying of the prayer,
came the angel who had authority over the scourge and loosed the man’s tongue: and the
all holy one asked the commander-in-chief: Who is this wretched one who has this chastise-

ment? And the commander-in-chief said: This, all holy one, is the steward who did not
the will of God, but ate the things of the church and said: “He who ministers to the altar
shall be nourished from the altar”:3964 and for this cause he is thus chastised here. And the
all holy one said: Let it be unto him according to his faith. And again he tied his tongue.</p>
<p>XVI. And Michael, the commander-in-chief said: Come hither, all holy one, and I will
show unto thee where the priests are chastised. And the all holy one came out and saw
presbyters hanging by their twenty nails, and fire came out of their heads. And seeing them
the all holy one asked the commander-in-chief: Who are these and what is their sin? And
the commander-in-chief said: These, all holy one, are they who stand beside the throne of
God, and when they sang of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, the pearls fell out, and the
awful throne of heaven shook and the footstool of our Lord Jesus Christ trembled, and they
did not perceive it: and for this cause they are thus chastised here.</p>
<p>XVII. And the all holy one saw a man and a winged beast having three heads like flames
of fire: the two heads were towards his eyes and the third head towards his mouth. And
seeing him the all holy one asked the commander-in-chief: Who is this, that he cannot save
himself from the mouth of the dragon? And the commander-in-chief said to her: This, all
holy one, is the reader who does not practise in his own habits according to what is worthy
of the holy Gospel: and for this cause he is thus chastised here.</p>
<p>XVIII. And the commander-in-chief said: Come hither, all holy one, and I will show
thee where the angelic and archangelic form is chastised. She proceeded and saw3965 them
lying in the fire and the sleepless worm gnawed them: and the all holy one said: Who are
these, and what is their sin? And the commander-in-chief said: These, all holy one, are
they who possessed the archangelic and apostolic form: hearken, all holy one, concerning
this: on earth they were called patriarchs and bishops, and they were not worthy of their
name: on earth they heard ‘Bless (the Lord) ye saints,’ and in heaven they were not called
saints, because they did not act as bearers of the archangelic form: and for this cause they
are thus chastised here.</p>
<p>XIX. And she saw women hanging by their nails, and a flame of fire came out of their
mouth and burned them: and all the beasts3966 coming out of the fire gnawed them to
pieces, and groaning they cried out: Have pity on us, have pity, for we are chastised worse
than all those who are under chastisement. And seeing them the all holy one wept, and
asked the commander-in-chief, Michael: Who are these and what is their sin? And the
commander-in-chief said: These are the wives of presbyters who did not honour the pres-

chastised here.</p>
<p>XX. And the all holy one saw after the same manner also a deaconess hanging from a
crag and a beast with two heads devoured her breasts. And the all holy one asked: What is
her sin? And the commander-in-chief said: She, all holy one, is an archdeaconess who defiled
her body in fornication, and for this cause she is thus chastised here.</p>
<p>XXI. And she saw other women hanging over the fire, and all the beasts devoured them.
And the all holy one asked the commander-in-chief: Who are these and what is their sin?
And he said: These are they who did not do the will of God, lovers of money and those who
took interest3967 on accounts, and the immodest.</p>
<p>XXII. And when she had heard these things the all holy one wept and said: Woe unto
sinners. And the commander-in-chief said: Why dost thou lament, all holy one? Now
verily thou hast not seen the great chastisements. And the highly favoured one said: Come,
Michael, the great commander-in-chief of the powers above, tell me how I may see all the
chastisements. And the commander-in-chief said: Where dost thou wish that we should
go, all holy one? to the East or towards the left parts of Paradise? And the all holy one said:
To the left parts of Paradise.</p>
<p>XXIII. And immediately when she had spoken, the cherubim and seraphim stood beside
her and led the highly favoured one out to the left parts of Paradise. And behold, there was
a great river, and the appearance of the river was blacker than pitch, and in it there were a
multitude3968 of men and women: it boiled like a furnace of forges, and its waves were like
a wild sea over the sinners: and when the waves rose, they sank the sinners ten thousand
cubits and they were unable to keep it off and say: Have mercy on us, thou just judge: for
the sleepless worm devoured them, and there was no reckoning of the number of those who
devoured them. And seeing the all holy Mother of God the angels3969 who chastised them
cried out with one voice: Holy is God who has compassion on account of the Mother of
God: we give thee thanks, O Son of God, that from eternity we did not see the light, and
to-day through the Mother of God we have seen the light: and again they shouted with one
voice, saying: Hail, highly favoured Mother of God: Hail, lamp of the inaccessible light:
Hail to thee also, Michael, the commander-in-chief, thou that art ambassador from the
whole creation: for we, seeing the chastisement of sinners are greatly grieved. And the all
holy one, when she saw the angels humbled on account of the sinners, lamented and said:
Woe to sinners and their neighbours. And the all holy one said: Let us see the sinners.

angels lifted up one voice saying: Lord have mercy. And after the making of the prayer
earnestly, the wave of the river rested and the fiery waves grew calm, and the sinners appeared
as a grain of mustard-seed: and seeing them the all holy one lamented and said: What is
this river, and what are its waves? And the commander-in-chief said: This river is the
outer fire, and those who are being tortured are the Jews who crucified our Lord Jesus Christ
the Son of God, and who refused holy baptism, and those who commit fornication and sin
against the sweet and passionless perfume of marriage, and he who debauches mother and
daughter, and the poisoners and those who slay with the sword, and the women who strangle
their offspring. And the all holy one said: According to their faith so be it unto them. And
straightway the waves rose over the sinners and the darkness covered them. And the commander-
in-chief said: Hearken, thou highly favoured one: if anyone shall be cast into this
darkness,3970 his remembrance shall never be in the sight of God. And the all holy Mother
of God said: Woe to sinners, because the flame of the fire is everlasting.</p>
<p>XXIV. And the commander-in-chief said: Come hither, all holy one, and I will show
unto thee the lake of fire: and see thou where the race of the Christians is chastised.3971
And the all holy one proceeded and saw: and some she heard, but others she did not see:
and she asked the commander-in-chief: Who are these, and what is their sin? And the
commander-in-chief said: These, all holy one, are those who were baptised and arrayed
under the oracle of Christ, but worked the works of the devil and wasted the time of their
repentance: and for this cause they are thus chastised here.</p>
<p>XXV. And she said: I pray, one request will I make of thee, let me also be chastised
with the Christians, because they are the children of my son. And the commander-in-chief
said: Rest thou in Paradise, holy lady, Mother of God. And the all holy one said: I pray
thee, move the fourteen firmaments and the seven heavens, and let us pray for the Christians
that the Lord our God may hearken unto us and have mercy on them.3972 And the commander-
in-chief said: As the Lord God liveth, the great name, seven times a day and seven
times a night, when we lead up the hymn of the Lord, we make remembrance for the sake
of sinners, and the Lord accounts us as naught.</p>
<p>XXVI. And the all holy one said: I pray thee, commander-in-chief, command the armies
of the angels and let them place me on the height of heaven and let me into the presence of
the invisible Father. And immediately the commander-in-chief commanded, and the
chariot of the cherubim and seraphim appeared, and they exalted the highly favoured one
to the height of heaven and placed her in the presence of the invisible Father: And she
stretched forth her hands to the undefiled throne of the Father and said: Have mercy, O

Lord, on the Christian sinners, for I saw them being chastised and I cannot bear their complaint.
Let me go forth and be chastised myself for the Christians. I do not pray, O Lord,
for the unbelieving Jews, but for the Christians I entreat thy compassion. And there came
a second voice from the invisible Father saying: How can I have mercy on them, when they
did not have mercy on their own brothers?3973 And the all holy one said: Lord, have mercy
on the sinners: behold the chastisements, for every creature on the earth calls upon my
name: and when the soul comes forth out of the body, it cries saying, “Holy Lady, Mother
of God.” Then the Lord said to her: Hearken, all holy Mother of God, if anyone names and
calls upon thy name, I will not forsake him, either in heaven or on earth.</p>
<p>XXVII. And the all holy one said: Where is Moses? Where are all the prophets and
fathers who never sinned? Where art thou, holy Paul of God? where is the holy Lord’s Day,
the boast of the Christians? where is the power of the precious and life-giving cross, which
delivered Adam and Eve from the ancient curse? Then Michael and all the angels raised
one voice saying: Lord, have mercy on the sinners. Then Moses also cried: Have mercy,
Lord, on those to whom I gave thy law. Then John also called: Have mercy, Lord, on those
to whom I gave thy Gospel. Then Paul cried: Have mercy, Lord, on those to whom I brought
thy epistles in the Church. And the Lord God said: Hearken, all ye righteous: if according
to the law which Moses gave, and according to the Gospel which John gave, and according
to the epistles which Paul carried, they thus be judged. And they had nothing to say except,
Have mercy, O just judge.</p>
<p>XXVIII. And the all holy Mother of God said: Have mercy, Lord, on the Christians,
because they kept thy law and gave heed to thy gospel, but they were simple ones. Then the
Lord said to her: Hearken, all holy one: if anyone did evil to them and they did not requite
him the evil, thou sayest well that they attended to both my law and my gospel, but if he did
not do them wrong and they requited him evil, how may I say that these are holy men? now
they shall be rewarded according to their wrongdoing. Then all hearing the voice of the
Lord had nothing to answer; and the all holy one, when she saw that the saints were at a
loss, and their Lord did not hear, and his mercy was hidden from them, then the all holy
one said: Where is Gabriel, who announced unto me the “Hail, thou that from eternity
shalt conceive him who is without beginning like the Father,” and now does not look upon
sinners? Where is the great commander-in-chief? come hither, all ye saints whom God
justified, and let us fall down in the presence of the invisible Father, in order that the Lord
God may hear us, and have mercy on sinners. Then Michael, the commander-in-chief, and
all the saints fell on their faces in the presence of the invisible Father, saying: Have mercy,
Lord, on the Christian sinners.</p>
<note type="footnote">3973 Cf. Esdras, l. c., pp. 469, 470.</note>
    
<pb n="344"/>
<p>XXIX. Then the Lord, seeing the prayer of the saints, had compassion and said: Go
down, my beloved son, and because of the prayer of the saints let thy face shine on earth to
sinners. Then the Lord came down from his undefiled throne: and when they saw Him,
those who were under chastisement raised one voice saying: Have mercy on us, King of
ages. Then the Lord of all things said: Hearken, all ye sinners and righteous men: I made
paradise and made man after my image: but he transgressed, and for his own sins was delivered
to death: but I did not suffer the works of my hands to be tyrannized over by the
serpent: wherefore I bowed the heavens and came down and was born of Mary, the holy
undefiled Mother of God, that I might set you free: I was baptised in Jordan in order that
I might save the creature (nature) which had grown old under sin: I was nailed to the
cross3974 to free you from the ancient curse: I asked for water and ye gave me vinegar
mingled with gall: I was laid in the grave: I trampled on the enemy: I raised up mine elect,
and even thus ye would not hear me. But now, because3975 of the prayer of my mother
Mary, because she has wept much for your sake, and because of Michael my archangel, and
because of the multitude of my saints, I grant you to have rest on the day of Pentecost to
glorify the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>XXX. Then all the angels and archangels, thrones, lordships, authorities, governments,
powers, and the many-eyed cherubim and the six-winged seraphim and all the apostles and
prophets and martyrs and all the saints raised one voice, saying: Glory to thee, O Lord:
glory to thee, lover of men: glory to thee, King of ages: glory be to thy compassion: glory
be to thy long suffering: glory be to thy unspeakable justice of judgment, because thou hast
been long-suffering with sinners and impious men: Thine is it to pity and to save. To him
be the glory and the power to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The translation is from Mr. M. R. James’s text in Texts and Studies, ii. 3, p. 130ff., published
from a fifteenth century ms. in the Bodleian Library. The original, Mr. James conjecturally
assigns to the tenth or eleventh century. It is notable for its close resemblance in
several passages to 4 Esdras, to the Greek original of which the author seems to have had
direct access.</p>
<p>Like the Apocalypse of Esdras it deals with the subject of intercession for sinners and
the reluctance of the seer to die. The parallel passages in 4 Esdras and the Apocalypse of
Esdras are pointed out in the margin of the translation.</p>
<p>Chapter I. consists of a few lines from the beginning and end of a homily on love which
appears in the ms. at the beginning of the Apocalypse, but which Mr. James regards as “quite
unimportant and quite irrelevant.”</p>

<head>The Apocalypse of Sedrach.</head>
<p>The Word of the holy and blessed Sedrach concerning love and concerning repentance
and Orthodox Christians, and concerning the Second Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Lord give thy blessing.</p>
<p>I. Beloved, let us prefer nothing in honour except sincere love: for in many things we
stumble every day and night and hour. And for this cause let us gain love, for it covereth a
multitude of sins: for what is the profit, my children, if we have all things, and have not
saving love…</p>
<p>O blessed love, supplier of all good things. Blessed is the man who has gained the true
faith and sincere love, according as the Master said, there is no greater love than this that a
man should lay down his life for his friend. Cf. John xv. 13.</p>
<p>II. And invisibly he received a voice in his ears: Come hither, Sedrach, since thou
wishest and desirest to converse with God and ask of him that he may reveal unto thee
whatever thou wishest to ask. And Sedrach said: What, Sir? And the voice said to him: I
was sent to thee to raise thee here into heaven. And he said: I desired to speak mouth to
mouth with God: I am not fit, Sir, to come into heaven. And stretching out his wings he
took him up and he came into heaven to the very flame, and he set him as high as the third
heaven, and in it stood the flame of the divinity.</p>
<p>III. And the Lord saith to him: Welcome, my beloved Sedrach: What suit hast thou
against God who created thee, that thou saidst, I desired to speak face to face with God?
Sedrach saith to him:3976 Yea, verily, the son hath a suit with the Father: my Lord, why
didst thou make the earth? The Lord saith to him: For man’s sake. Sedrach saith: And
why didst Thou make the sea? Why didst Thou scatter every good thing on the earth? The
Lord saith to him: For man’s sake. Sedrach saith to him:3977 If thou didst these things,3978
why wilt Thou destroy him? And the Lord said: Man is my work and the creature of my
hands, and I discipline him as I find good.</p>
<p>IV. Sedrach saith to him: Chastisement and fire are thy discipline: they are bitter, my
Lord:3979 it were well for man if he had not been born: why then didst thou make him, my
Lord? Why didst thou weary thine undefiled hands3980 and create man, since thou didst
not intend to have mercy on him? God saith to him: I made Adam the first creature and

placed him in Paradise in the midst of the tree of life and said to him: Eat of all the fruits,
but beware of the tree of life: for if thou eat of it, thou shalt die the death. But he transgressed
my commandment, and being beguiled by the devil ate of the tree.</p>
<p>V. Sedrach saith to him: Of thy will Adam was beguiled, my Lord: Thou commandest
thine3981 angels to make approach to Adam, and the first of the angels himself transgressed
thy commandment and did not make approach to him, and Thou didst banish him, because
he transgressed thy commandment and did not make any approach to the work of thine
hands: if thou lovedst man, why didst Thou not slay the devil, the worker of unrighteousness?
Who is able to fight an invisible spirit? And he as a smoke enters into the hearts of
men and teaches them every sin: he fights against thee, the immortal God, and what can
wretched man then do to him? But have mercy, O Lord, and stop the chastisements: but
if not, count me also with the sinners: if thou wilt have no mercy on the sinners, where are
thy mercies, where is thy3982 compassion, O Lord?</p>
<p>VI. God saith to him: Be it known unto thee that I ordered all things to be placable to
him: I gave him understanding and made him the heir of heaven and earth, and I subjected
all things to him, and every living thing flees from him and from before his face: but he,
having received of mine, became alien, adulterous, and sinful: tell me, what father, having
given his son his portion, when he takes his substance and leaves his father and goes away
and becomes an alien and serves an alien, when the father sees that the son has deserted
him, does not darken his heart, and does not the father go and take his substance and banish
him from his glory because he deserted his father? And how have I, the wonderful and
jealous God, given him everything, and he having received these things has become an
adulterer and a sinner?</p>
<p>VII. Sedrach saith to him: Thou, O Lord, didst create man. Thou knewest of what sort
of mind he was and of what sort of knowledge we are, and thou makest it a cause for chastisement:
but cast him forth; for shall not I alone fill up the heavenly places? But if that is
not to be so save man too, O Lord. He failed by thy will, wretched man. Why dost thou
waste words on me, Sedrach? I created Adam and his wife and the sun and said: Behold
each other how bright he is, and the wife of Adam is brighter in the beauty of the moon and
he was the giver of her life.3983 Sedrach saith: but of what profit are beauties if they die
away into the earth? How didst thou say, O Lord, Thou shalt not return evil for evil? How
is it, O Lord? the word of Thy divinity never lies, and why dost Thou retaliate on man? or
dost thou not in so doing render evil for evil? I know that among the quadrupeds there is
no other so wily and unreasonable as the mule. But we strike it with the bridle when we

wish: and thou hast angels: send them forth to guard them, and when man inclines towards
sin, to take hold of his foot and not let him go whither he would.</p>
<p>VIII. God saith to him: If I catch him by the foot, he will say, Thou hast given me no
joy in the world. But I have left him to his own will because I loved him. Wherefore I sent
forth my righteous angels to guard him night and day. Sedrach saith:3984 I know, O Lord,
that of all thy creatures Thou chiefly lovedst man, of the quadrupeds the sheep, of woods
the olive, of fruits the vine, of flying things the bee, of rivers the Jordan, of cities Jerusalem.
And all these man also loves, my Lord. God saith to Sedrach: I will ask thee one thing,
Sedrach: if thou answerest me, then I may fitly help thee, even though thou hast tempted
thy creator. Sedrach saith: Speak.3985 The Lord God saith: Since I made all things, how
many men were born and how many died, and how many are to die and how many hairs
have they? Tell me, Sedrach,3986 since the heaven was created and the earth, how many
trees grew in the world, and how many fell, and how many are to fall, and how many are to
arise, and how many leaves have they? Tell me, Sedrach, since I made the sea, how many
waves arose and how many fell, and how many are to arise, and how many winds blow along
the margin of the sea? Tell me, Sedrach, from the creation of the world of the æons, when
the air rained, how many drops fell upon the world, and how many are to fall? And Sedrach
said: Thou alone knowest all these things, O Lord; thou only understandest all these things:
only, I pray thee, deliver man from chastisement, and I shall not be separated from our race.</p>
<p>IX. And God said to his only begotten Son: Go,3987 take the soul of Sedrach my beloved,
and place it in Paradise. The only begotten Son saith to Sedrach: Give me the trust which
our Father deposited in the womb of thy mother in the holy tabernacle of thy body from a
child. Sedrach saith: I will not give thee my soul. God saith to him: And wherefore was I
sent to come hither, and thou pleadest against me? For I was commanded by my Father
not to take thy soul with violence; but if not, (then) give me thy most greatly desired soul.</p>
<p>X. And Sedrach saith to God: And whence dost Thou intend to take my soul, and from
which limb? And God saith to him: Dost thou not know that it is placed in the midst of
thy lungs and thy heart and is dispersed into all thy limbs? It is brought up through the
throat and gullet and the mouth and at whatever hour it is predestined to come forth, it is
scattered, and brought together from the points of the nails and from all the limbs, and there
is a great necessity that it should be separated from the body and parted from the heart.
When Sedrach had heard all these things and had considered the memory of death he was

greatly astounded, and Sedrach said to God: O Lord, give me a little respite that I may weep,
for I have heard that tears are able to do much and much remedy comes to the lowly body
of thy creature.</p>
<p>XI. And weeping and bewailing he began to say: O marvellous head of heavenly adornment:
O radiant as the sun which shines on heaven and earth: thy hairs are known from
Teman, thine eyes from Bosor, thine ears from thunder, thy tongue from a trumpet, and
thy brain is a small creation, thy head the energy of the whole body: O friendly and most
fair beloved by all, and now falling into the earth it must become forgotten. O hands, mild,
fair-fingered, worn with toil by which the body is nourished: O hands, deftest of all, heaping
up from all quarters ye made ready houses. O fingers adorned and decked with gold and
silver (rings): and great worlds are led by the fingers: the three joints enfold the palms, and
heap up beautiful things: and now ye must become aliens to the world. O feet, skilfully
walking about, self-running, most swift, unconquerable: O knees, fitted together, because
without you the body does not move: the feet run along with the sun and the moon in the
night and in the day, heaping up all things, foods and drinks, and nourishing the body: O
feet, most swift and fair runners, moving on the face of the earth, getting ready the house
with every good thing: O feet which bear up the whole body, that run up to the temples,
making repentance and calling on the saints, and now ye are to remain motionless. O head
and hands and feet, until now I have kept you. O soul, what sent thee into the humble and
wretched body? and now being separated from it, thou art going up where the Lord calleth
thee, and the wretched body goes away to judgment. O body well-adorned, hair clothed
with stars, head of heavenly adornment and dress: O face well-anointed, light-bringing
eyes, voice trumpet-like, tongue placable, chin fairly adorned, hairs like the stars, head high
as heaven, body decked out, light-bringing eyes that know all things—and now you shall
fall into the earth and under the earth your beauty shall disappear.</p>
<p>XII. Christ saith to him: Stay, Sedrach; how long dost thou weep and groan? Paradise
is opened to thee, and, dying, thou shalt live. Sedrach saith to him: Once more I will speak
unto thee, O Lord: How long shall I live before I die? and do not disregard my prayer. The
Lord saith to him: Speak, O Sedrach. Sedrach saith: If a man shall live eighty or ninety or
an hundred years, and live these years in sin, and again shall turn, and the man live in repentance,
in how many days dost thou forgive him his sins? God saith to him: If he shall
live an hundred or eighty years and shall turn and repent for three years and do the fruit of
righteousness, and death shall overtake him, I will not remember all his sins.</p>
<p>XIII. Sedrach saith to him: The three years are a long time, my Lord, lest death overtake
him and he fulfil not his repentance: have mercy, Lord, on thine image and have compassion,
for the three years are many. God saith to him: If a man live an hundred years and remember
his death and confess before men and I find him, after a time I will forgive all his sins.
Sedrach saith again: I will again beseech thy compassion for thy creature. The time is long

<pb n="351"/>
lest death overtake him and snatch him suddenly. The Saviour saith to him: I will ask thee
one word, Sedrach, my beloved, then thou shalt ask me in turn: if the man shall repent for
forty days I will not remember all his sins which he did.</p>
<p>XIV. And Sedrach saith3988 to the archangel Michael: Hearken to me, O powerful
chief, and help thou me and be my envoy that God may have mercy on the world. And
falling on their faces, they besought the Lord and said: O Lord, teach us how and by what
sort of repentance and by what labour man shall be saved. God saith: By repentances, by
intercessions, by liturgies, by tears in streams, in hot groanings. Dost thou not know that
my prophet David was saved by tears, and the rest were saved in one moment? Thou
knowest, Sedrach, that there are nations which have not the law and which do the works of
the law: for if they are unbaptized and my divine spirit come unto them and they turn to
my baptism, I also receive them with my righteous ones into Abraham’s bosom. And there
are some who have been baptized with my baptism and who have shared in my divine part
and become reprobate in complete reprobation and will not repent: and I suffer them with
much compassion and much pity and wealth3989 in order that they may repent, but they
do the things which my divinity hates, and did not hearken to the wise man asking (them),
saying, we by no means justify a sinner. Dost thou not most certainly know that it is written:
And those who repent never see chastisement? And they did not hearken to the Apostles
or to my word in the Gospels, and they grieve my angels, and verily they do not attend to
my messenger in the assemblies (for communion) and in my services, and they do not stand
in my holy churches, but they stand and do not fall down and worship in fear and trembling,
but boast things which I do not accept, or my holy angels.</p>
<p>XV. Sedrach saith to God: O Lord, Thou alone art sinless and very compassionate,
having compassion and pity for sinners, but thy divinity said: I am not come to call the
righteous but sinners to repentance. And the Lord said to Sedrach: Dost thou not know,
Sedrach, that the thief was saved in one moment to repent? Dost thou not know that my
apostle and evangelist was saved in one moment? “Peccatores enim non salvantur,” for their
hearts are like rotten stone: these are they who walk in impious ways and who shall be
destroyed with Antichrist. Sedrach saith: O my Lord, Thou also saidst: My divine spirit
entered into the nations which, not having the law, do the things of the law. So also the
thief and the apostle and evangelist and the rest of those who have already got into thy
Kingdom. O my Lord; so likewise do Thou pardon those who have sinned to the last: for
life is very toilsome and there is no time for repentance.</p>
<p>XVI. The Lord saith to Sedrach: I made man in three stages: when he is young, I
overlooked his stumblings as he was young: and again when he was a man I considered his
<note type="footnote">3988 Cf. Test. of Abraham, Rec. A. §§ xiv., xviii.</note>
<note type="footnote">3989 Rom. ii. 4.</note>
    
<pb n="352"/>
purpose: and again when he grows old, I watch him till he repent. Sedrach saith: O Lord,
Thou knowest and understandest all these things: but have sympathy for sinners. The Lord
saith to him: Sedrach, my beloved, I promise to have sympathy and bring down the forty
days to twenty: and whosoever shall remember thy name shall not see the place of chastisement,
but shall be with the just in a place of refreshment and rest: and if anyone shall record
this wonderful word his sins shall not be reckoned against him for ever and ever.3990 And
Sedrach saith: O Lord, and if anyone shall bring enlightenment to thy servant, save him, O
Lord, from all evil. And Sedrach, the servant of the Lord, saith: Now take my soul, O Lord.
And God took him and placed him in Paradise with all the saints. To whom be the glory
and the power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>The Testament of Abraham.</head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The Greek text of both the recensions of this work is published for the first time in
“Texts and Studies,” Vol. II., No. 2 (Cambridge, 1892), by Montague Rhodes James, M.A.
None of the manuscripts are older than the thirteenth century; of the six which contain the
longer version the best is a Paris ms. written 1315, and the principal ms. of the shorter recension
(also in Paris) belongs to the fifteenth century. There are also versions in Roumanian,
Slavonic, Ethiopic, and Arabic.</p>
<p>The work itself has hitherto been little noticed, and it is doubtful how far it was well
known in ancient times. It is perhaps that cited as “Abraham” in early lists of Apocryphal
works, and some passages in early Christian writers may indicate their knowledge of such
a work. The evidence for this is given in full by the editor of the Greek text in his introduction
(pp. 7–29). The conclusions drawn by him from these notices, and from the work itself, are
“that it was written in the second century, that it embodies legends earlier than that century,
that it received its present form perhaps in the ninth or tenth century.” Certain features in
it also “seem to point to Egypt as its birthplace,” such as the conception of Death in the
longer recension, which has parallels in the Coptic Apocryphal books, the weighing of souls,
and the presence of recording angels at the judgment scene.</p>
<p>Neither of the two versions can be supposed to be true copies of the original work. They
differ from each other not only in length, but in arrangement. The shorter recension may
preserve more of the original language, but it transposes certain sections, thereby confusing
the order of the narrative, and in this the Arabic version generally agrees with it. The most
essential discrepancy begins with Chap. X. of the longer recension, where Abraham, after
being taken up on the cloud, is first shown the iniquities that take place on earth. The
shorter text places this at the end of his journey, quite destroying the original moral of the
writer, who wishes to emphasize the mercy of God, and to show how Abraham’s righteous
indignation is replaced by feelings of compassion for the sinner. The vision of judgment is
then altered in the shorter version, the doubtful soul being there condemned, instead of
being saved by the intercession of Abraham. In this point the editor thinks that the shorter
recension may have been influenced by the Apocalypse of Paul, as would also seem to be
the case with Michael’s reason for leaving Abraham in Chap. IV, which is quite different
from the pretext given in the longer text. It is also remarkable that in the shorter form there
is no word. of Abraham’s unwillingness to die, which is so prominent a feature of the other,
<pb n="354"/>
and is no doubt original, as the idea is not otherwise unknown in Apocryphal literature.
The conclusion of the shorter version is very much curtailed, compared with the longer one.</p>
<p>On account of these many differences between the recensions of this remarkable work,
it has been judged best to give both of them entire, and so arranged that the reader can
readily discover in what respects the one differs from the other.</p>
<p>The tone of the work is perhaps rather Jewish than Christian, but as phrases and conceptions
of a New Testament character appear in it, especially in the judgment scene, it is
most probably to be assigned to a Jewish Christian, who for the substance of it drew partly
on older legends, and partly on his own imagination. Some of its features are very striking,
and a few of them do not seem to occur elsewhere in literature of this class; it is possible
that some of these do not go further back than the medieval editors of the text. Among the
most remarkable points may be noticed the age of Abraham, variously given in different
mss., his hospitality, and the sending of Michael to announce his death (Chap. I.): Michael’s
refusal to mount a horse (Chap. II.): the tree speaking with a human voice (Chap. III.); the
tears of Michael turning into precious stones (ibid.); and the devouring spirit sent to consume
the food for him (Chap. IV.). In Chap. VI. the narrative of Genesis is recalled by Sarah’s
recognizing Michael as one of the three who came to Abraham at the oak of Mamre, with
the added circumstance of the calf rising up whole after being eaten. The dream of Isaac in
Chap. VII. is perhaps remotely suggested by that of Joseph. The whole vision of judgment,
with the presence of Adam and Abel, is very noteworthy, as also the conception of Death,
and the explanation of his various forms.</p>

<head>The Testament of Abraham.</head>
<head>Version I.</head>
<p>I. Abraham lived the measure of his life, nine hundred and ninety-five years, and having
lived all the years of his life in quietness, gentleness, and righteousness, the righteous one
was exceeding hospitable; for, pitching his tent in the cross-ways at the oak of Mamre, he
received every one, both rich and poor, kings and rulers, the maimed and the helpless,
friends and strangers, neighbors and travelers, all alike did the devout, all-holy, righteous,
and hospitable Abraham entertain. Even upon him, however, there came the common, inexorable,
bitter lot of death, and the uncertain end of life. Therefore the Lord God, summoning
his archangel Michael, said to him: Go down, chief-captain3991 Michael, to Abraham
and speak to him concerning his death, that he may set his affairs in order, for I have blessed
him as the stars of heaven, and as the sand by the sea-shore, and he is in abundance of long
life and many possessions, and is becoming exceeding rich. Beyond all men, moreover, he
is righteous in every goodness, hospitable and loving to the end of his life; but do thou,
archangel Michael, go to Abraham, my beloved friend, and announce to him his death and
assure him thus: Thou shalt at this time depart from this vain world, and shalt quit the
body, and go to thine own Lord among the good.</p>
<p>II. And the chief-captain departed from before the face of God, and went down to Abraham
to the oak of Mamre, and found the righteous Abraham in the field close by, sitting
beside yokes of oxen for ploughing, together with the sons of Masek and other servants, to
the number of twelve. And behold the chief-captain came to him, and Abraham, seeing the
chief-captain Michael coming from afar, like to a very comely warrior, arose and met him
as was his custom, meeting and entertaining all strangers. And the chief-captain saluted
him and said: Hail, most honored father, righteous soul chosen of God, true son of the
heavenly one. Abraham said to the chief-captain: Hail, most honored warrior, bright as
the sun and most beautiful above all the sons of men; thou art welcome; therefore I beseech
thy presence, tell me whence the youth of thy age has come; teach me, thy suppliant, whence
and from what army and from what journey thy beauty has come hither. The chief-captain
said: I, O righteous Abraham, come from the great city. I have been sent by the great king
to take the place of a good friend of his, for the king has summoned him. And Abraham
said, Come, my Lord, go with me as far as my field. The chief-captain said: I come; and
going into the field of the ploughing, they sat down beside the company. And Abraham
said to his servants, the sons of Masek: Go ye to the herd of horses, and bring two horses,
quiet, and gentle and tame, so that I and this stranger may sit thereon. But the chief-captain
<note type="footnote">3991 Literally Commander-in-chief, or Chief-General.</note>
    
<pb n="356"/>
said, Nay, my Lord, Abraham, let them not bring horses, for I abstain from ever sitting upon
any four-footed beast. Is not my king rich in much merchandise, having power both over
men and all kinds of cattle? but I abstain from ever sitting upon any four-footed beast. Let
us go, then, O righteous soul, walking lightly until we reach thy house. And Abraham said,
Amen, be it so.</p>
<p>III. And as they went on from the field toward his house, beside that way there stood
a cypress tree, and by the command of the Lord the tree cried out with a human voice, saying,
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God that calls himself to those that love him; but Abraham hid
the mystery, thinking that the chief-captain had not heard the voice of the tree. And coming
nigh to the house they sat down in the court, and Isaac seeing the face of the angel said to
Sarah his mother, My lady mother, behold, the man sitting with my father Abraham is not
a son of the race of those that dwell on the earth. And Isaac ran, and saluted him, and fell
at the feet of the Incorporeal, and the Incorporeal blessed him and said, The Lord God will
grant thee his promise that he made to thy father Abraham and to his seed, and will also
grant thee the precious prayer of thy father and thy mother. Abraham said to Isaac his son,
My son Isaac, draw water from the well, and bring it me in the vessel, that we may wash the
feet of this stranger, for he is tired, having come to us from off a long journey. And Isaac
ran to the well and drew water in the vessel and brought it to them, and Abraham went up
and washed the feet of the chief captain Michael, and the heart of Abraham was moved, and
he wept over the stranger. And Isaac, seeing his father weeping, wept also, and the chief
captain, seeing them weeping, also wept with them, and the tears of the chief captain fell
upon the vessel into the water of the basin and became precious stones. And Abraham
seeing the marvel, and being astonished, took the stones secretly, and hid the mystery,
keeping it by himself in his heart.</p>
<p>IV. And Abraham said to Isaac his son: Go, my beloved son, into the inner chamber
of the house and beautify it. Spread for us there two couches, one for me and one for this
man that is guest with us this day. Prepare for us there a seat and a candlestick and a table
with abundance of every good thing. Beautify the chamber, my son, and spread under us
linen and purple and fine linen. Burn there every precious and excellent incense, and bring
sweet-smelling plants from the garden and fill our house with them. Kindle seven lamps
full of oil, so that we may rejoice, for this man that is our guest this day is more glorious
than kings or rulers, and his appearance surpasses all the sons of men. And Isaac prepared
all things well, and Abraham taking the archangel Michael went into the chamber, and they
both sat down upon the couches, and between them he placed a table with abundance of
every good thing. Then the chief captain arose and went out, as if by constraint of his belly
to make issue of water, and ascended to heaven in the twinkling of an eye, and stood before
the Lord, and said to him: Lord and Master, let thy power know that I am unable to remind
that righteous man of his death, for I have not seen upon the earth a man like him, pitiful,

<pb n="357"/>
hospitable, righteous, truthful, devout, refraining from every evil deed. And now know,
Lord, that I cannot remind him of his death. And the Lord said: Go down, chief-captain
Michael, to my friend Abraham, and whatever he say to thee, that do thou also, and whatever
he eat, eat thou also with him. And I will send my Holy Spirit upon his son Isaac, and will
put the remembrance of his death into the heart of Isaac, so that even he in a dream may
see the death of his father, and Isaac will relate the dream, and thou shalt interpret it, and
he himself will know his end. And the chief-captain said, Lord, all the heavenly spirits are
incorporeal, and neither eat nor drink, and this man has set before me a table with abundance
of all good things earthly and corruptible. Now, Lord, what shall I do? How shall I escape
him, sitting at one table with him? The Lord said: Go down to him, and take no thought
for this, for when thou sittest down with him, I will send upon thee a devouring spirit, and
it will consume out of thy hands and through thy mouth all that is on the table. Rejoice together
with him in everything, only thou shalt interpret well the things of the vision, that
Abraham may know the sickle of death and the uncertain end of life, and may make disposal
of all his possessions, for I have blessed him above the sand of the sea and as the stars of
heaven.</p>
<p>V. Then the chief captain went down to the house of Abraham, and sat down with him
at the table, and Isaac served them. And when the supper was ended, Abraham prayed after
his custom, and the chief-captain prayed together with him, and each lay down to sleep
upon his couch. And Isaac said to his father, Father, I too would fain sleep with you in this
chamber, that I also may hear your discourse, for I love to hear the excellence of the conversation
of this virtuous man. Abraham said, Nay, my son, but go to thy own chamber and
sleep on thy own couch, lest we be troublesome to this man. Then Isaac, having received
the prayer from them, and having blessed them, went to his own chamber and lay down
upon his couch. But the Lord cast the thought of death into the heart of Isaac as in a dream,
and about the third hour of the night Isaac awoke and rose up from his couch, and came
running to the chamber where his father was sleeping together with the archangel. Isaac,
therefore, on reaching the door cried out, saying, My father Abraham, arise and open to me
quickly, that I may enter and hang upon thy neck, and embrace thee before they take thee
away from me. Abraham therefore arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and hung
upon his neck, and began to weep with a loud voice. Abraham therefore being moved at
heart, also wept with a loud voice, and the chief-captain, seeing them weeping, wept also.
Sarah being in her room, heard their weeping, and came running to them, and found them
embracing and weeping. And Sarah said with weeping, My Lord Abraham, what is this that
ye weep? Tell me, my Lord, has this brother that has been entertained by us this day brought
thee tidings of Lot, thy brother’s son, that he is dead? is it for this that ye grieve thus? The
chief-captain answered and said to her, Nay, my sister Sarah, it is not as thou sayest, but thy
<pb n="358"/>
son Isaac, methinks, beheld a dream, and came to us weeping, and we seeing him were
moved in our hearts and wept.
189</p>
<p>VI. Then Sarah, hearing the excellence of the conversation of the chief-captain,
straightway knew that it was an angel of the Lord that spoke. Sarah therefore signified to
Abraham to come out towards the door, and said to him, My Lord Abraham, knowest thou
who this man is? Abraham said, I know not. Sarah said, Thou knowest, my Lord, the three
men from heaven that were entertained by us in our tent beside the oak of Mamre, when
thou didst kill the kid without blemish, and set a table before them. After the flesh had been
eaten, the kid rose again, and sucked its mother with great joy. Knowest thou not, my Lord
Abraham, that by promise they gave to us Isaac as the fruit of the womb? Of these three
holy men this is one. Abraham said, O Sarah, in this thou speakest the truth. Glory and
praise from our God and the Father. For late in the evening when I washed his feet in the
basin I said in my heart, These are the feet of one of the three men that I washed then; and
his tears that fell into the basin then became precious stones. And shaking them out from
his lap he gave them to Sarah, saying, If thou believest me not, look now at these. And Sarah
receiving them bowed down and saluted and said, Glory be to God that showeth us wonderful
things. And now know, my Lord Abraham, that there is among us the revelation of some
thing, whether it be evil or good!</p>
<p>VII. And Abraham left Sarah, and went into the chamber, and said to Isaac, Come
hither, my beloved son, tell me the truth, what it was thou sawest and what befell thee that
thou camest so hastily to us. And Isaac answering began to say, I saw, my Lord, in this night
the sun and the moon above my head, surrounding me with its rays and giving me light.
As I gazed at this and rejoiced, I saw the heaven opened, and a man bearing light descend
from it, shining more than seven suns. And this man like the sun came and took away the
sun from my head, and went up into the heavens from whence he came, but I was greatly
grieved that he took away the sun from me. After a little, as I was still sorrowing and sore
troubled, I saw this man come forth from heaven a second time, and he took away from me
the moon also from off my head, and I wept greatly and called upon that man of light, and
said, Do not, my Lord, take away my glory from me; pity me and hear me, and if thou takest
away the sun from me, then leave the moon to me. He said, Suffer them to be taken up to
the king above, for he wishes them there. And he took them away from me, but he left the
rays upon me. The chief-captain said, Hear, O righteous Abraham; the sun which thy son
saw is thou his father, and the moon likewise is Sarah his mother. The man bearing light
who descended from heaven, this is the one sent from God who is to take thy righteous soul
from thee. And now know, O most honored Abraham, that at this time thou shalt leave
this worldly life, and remove to God. Abraham said to the chief captain O strangest of
marvels! and now art thou he that shall take my soul from me? The chief-captain said to
him, I am the chief-captain Michael, that stands before the Lord, and I was sent to thee to

<pb n="359"/>
remind thee of thy death, and then I shall depart to him as I was commanded. Abraham
said, Now I know that thou art an angel of the Lord, and wast sent to take my soul, but I
will not go with thee; but do thou whatever thou art commanded.</p>
<p>VIII. The chief-captain hearing these words immediately vanished, and ascending into
heaven stood before God, and told all that he had seen in the house of Abraham; and the
chief-captain said this also to his Lord, Thus says thy friend Abraham, I will not go with
thee, but do thou whatever thou art commanded; and now, O Lord Almighty, doth thy glory
and immortal kingdom order aught? God said to the chief-captain Michael, Go to my friend
Abraham yet once again, and speak to him thus, Thus saith the Lord thy God, he that brought
thee into the land of promise, that blessed thee above the sand of the sea and above the stars
of heaven, that opened the womb of barrenness of Sarah, and granted thee Isaac as the fruit
of the womb in old age, Verily I say unto thee that blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying
I will multiply thy seed, and I will give thee all that thou shalt ask from me, for I am the Lord
thy God, and besides me there is no other. Tell me why thou hast rebelled against me, and
why there is grief in thee, and why thou rebelled against my archangel Michael? Knowest
thou not that all who have come from Adam and Eve have died, and that none of the
prophets has escaped death? None of those that rule as kings is immortal; none of thy
forefathers has escaped the mystery of death. They have all died, they have all departed into
Hades, they are all gathered by the sickle of death. But upon thee I have not sent death, I
have not suffered any deadly disease to come upon thee, I have not permitted the sickle of
death to meet thee, I have not allowed the nets of Hades to enfold thee, I have never wished
thee to meet with any evil. But for good comfort I have sent my chief-captain Michael to
thee, that thou mayst know thy departure from the world, and set thy house in order, and
all that belongs to thee, and bless Isaac thy beloved son. And now know that I have done
this not wishing to grieve thee. Wherefore then hast thou said to my chief-captain, I will
not go with thee? Wherefore hast thou spoken thus? Knowest thou not that if I give leave
to death and he comes upon thee, then I should see whether thou wouldst come or not?</p>
<p>IX. And the chief-captain receiving the exhortations of the Lord went down to Abraham,
and seeing him the righteous one fell upon his face to the ground as one dead, and the chiefcaptain
told him all that he had heard from the Most High. Then the holy and just Abraham
rising with many tears fell at the feet of the Incorporeal, and besought him, saying, I beseech
thee, chief-captain of the hosts above, since thou hast wholly deigned to come thyself to me
a sinner and in all things thy unworthy servant, I beseech thee even now, O chief-captain,
to carry my word yet again to the Most High, and thou shalt say to him, Thus saith Abraham
thy servant, Lord, Lord, in every work and word which I have asked of thee thou hast heard
me, and hast fulfilled all my counsel. Now, Lord, I resist not thy power, for I too know that
I am not immortal but mortal. Since therefore to thy command all things yield, and fear
and tremble at the face of thy power, I also fear, but I ask one request of thee, and now, Lord
<pb n="360"/>
and Master, hear my prayer, for while still in this body I desire to see all the inhabited earth,
and all the creations which thou didst establish by one word, and when I see these, then if
I shall depart from life I shall be without sorrow. So the chief-captain went back again, and
stood before God, and told him all, saying, Thus saith thy friend Abraham, I desired to behold
all the earth in my lifetime before I died. And the Most High hearing this, again commanded
the chief-captain Michael, and said to him, Take a cloud of light, and the angels that have
power over the chariots, and go down, take the righteous Abraham upon a chariot of the
cherubim, and exalt him into the air of heaven that he may behold all the earth.</p>
<p>X. And the archangel Michael went down and took Abraham upon a chariot of the
cherubim, and exalted him into the air of heaven, and led him upon the cloud together with
sixty angels, and Abraham ascended upon the chariot over all the earth. And Abraham saw
the world as it was in that day, some ploughing, others driving wains, in one place men
herding flocks, and in another watching them by night, and dancing and playing and
harping, in another place men striving and contending at law, elsewhere men weeping and
having the dead in remembrance. He saw also the newly-wedded received with honor, and
in a word he saw all things that are done in the world, both good and bad. Abraham therefore
passing over them saw men bearing swords, wielding in their hands sharpened swords, and
Abraham asked the chief-captain, Who are these? The chief-captain said, These are thieves,
who intend to commit murder, and to steal and burn and destroy. Abraham said, Lord,
Lord, hear my voice, and command that wild beasts may come out of the wood and devour
them. And even as he spoke there came wild beasts out of the wood and devoured them.
And he saw in another place a man with a woman committing fornication with each other,
and said, Lord, Lord, command that the earth may open and swallow them, and straightway
the earth was cleft and swallowed them. And he saw in another place men digging through
a house, and carrying away other men’s possessions, and he said, Lord, Lord, command that
fire may come down from heaven and consume them. And even as he spoke, fire came
down from heaven and consumed them. And straightway there came a voice from heaven
to the chief-captain, saying thus, O chief-captain Michael, command the chariot to stop,
and turn Abraham away that he may not see all the earth, for if he behold all that live in
wickedness, he will destroy all creation. For behold, Abraham has not sinned, and has no
pity on sinners, but I have made the world, and desire not to destroy any one of them, but
wait for the death of the sinner, till he be converted and live. But take Abraham up to the
first gate of heaven, that he may see there the judgments and recompenses, and repent of
the souls of the sinners that he has destroyed.</p>
<p>XI. So Michael turned the chariot and brought Abraham to the east, to the first gate of
heaven; and Abraham saw two ways, the one narrow and contracted, the other broad and
spacious, and there he saw two gates, the one broad on the broad way, and the other narrow
on the narrow way. And outside the two gates there he saw a man sitting upon a gilded
<pb n="361"/>
throne, and the appearance of that man was terrible, as of the Lord.3992 And they saw many
souls driven by angels and led in through the broad gate, and other souls, few in number,
that were taken by the angels through the narrow gate. And when the wonderful one who
sat upon the golden throne saw few entering through the narrow gate, and many entering
through the broad one, straightway that wonderful one tore the hairs of his head and the
sides of his beard, and threw himself on the ground from his throne, weeping and lamenting.
But when he saw many souls entering through the narrow gate, then he arose from the
ground and sat upon his throne in great joy, rejoicing and exulting. And Abraham asked
the chief-captain, My Lord chief-captain, who is this most marvelous man, adorned with
such glory, and sometimes he weeps and laments, and sometimes he rejoices and exults?
The incorporeal one said: This is the first-created Adam who is in such glory, and he looks
upon the world because all are born from him, and when he sees many souls going through
the narrow gate, then he arises and sits upon his throne rejoicing and exulting in joy, because
this narrow gate is that of the just, that leads to life, and they that enter through it go into
Paradise. For this, then, the first-created Adam rejoices, because he sees the souls being
saved. But when he sees many souls entering through the broad gate, then he pulls out the
hairs of his head, and casts himself on the ground weeping and lamenting bitterly, for the
broad gate is that of sinners, which leads to destruction and eternal punishment. And for
this the first-formed Adam falls from his throne weeping and lamenting for the destruction
of sinners, for they are many that are lost, and they are few that are saved, for in seven
thousand there is scarcely found one soul saved, being righteous and undefiled.</p>
<p>XII. While he was yet saying these things to me, behold two angels, fiery in aspect, and
pitiless in mind, and severe in look, and they drove on thousands of souls, pitilessly lashing
them with fiery thongs. The angel laid hold of one soul, and they drove all the souls in at
the broad gate to destruction. So we also went along with the angels, and came within that
broad gate, and between the two gates stood a throne terrible of aspect, of terrible crystal,
gleaming as fire, and upon it sat a wondrous man bright as the sun, like to the Son of God.
Before him stood a table like crystal, all of gold and fine linen, and upon the table there was
lying a book, the thickness of it six cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits, and on the right
and left of it stood two angels holding paper and ink and pen. Before the table sat an angel
of light, holding in his hand a balance, and on his left sat an angel all fiery, pitiless, and
severe, holding in his hand a trumpet, having within it all-consuming fire with which to try
the sinners. The wondrous man who sat upon the throne himself judged and sentenced the
souls, and the two angels on the right and on the left wrote down, the one on the right the
righteousness and the one on the left the wickedness. The one before the table, who held
the balance, weighed the souls, and the fiery angel, who held the fire, tried the souls. And
<note type="footnote">3992 Two mss. read, “Of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</note>
<pb n="362"/>
Abraham asked the chief-captain Michael, What is this that we behold? And the chiefcaptain
said, These things that thou seest, holy Abraham, are the judgment and recompense.
And behold the angel holding the soul in his hand, and he brought it before the judge, and
the judge said to one of the angels that served him, Open me this book, and find me the sins
of this soul. And opening the book he found its sins and its righteousness equally balanced,
and he neither gave it to the tormentors, nor to those that were saved, but set it in the midst.</p>
<p>XIII. And Abraham said, My Lord chief-captain, who is this most wondrous judge?
and who are the angels that write down? and who is the angel like the sun, holding the balance?
and who is the fiery angel holding the fire? The chief-captain said, “Seest thou, most
holy Abraham, the terrible man sitting upon the throne? This is the son of the first created
Adam, who is called Abel, whom the wicked Cain killed, and he sits thus to judge all creation,
and examines righteous men and sinners. For God has said, I shall not judge you, but every
man born of man shall be judged. Therefore he has given to him judgment, to judge the
world until his great and glorious coming, and then, O righteous Abraham, is the perfect
judgment and recompense, eternal and unchangeable, which no one can alter. For every
man has come from the first-created, and therefore they are first judged here by his son,
and at the second coming they shall be judged by the twelve tribes of Israel, every breath
and every creature. But the third time they shall be judged by the Lord God of all, and then,
indeed, the end of that judgment is near, and the sentence terrible, and there is none to deliver.
And now by three tribunals the judgment of the world and the recompense is made,
and for this reason a matter is not finally confirmed by one or two witnesses, but by three
witnesses shall everything be established. The two angels on the right hand and on the left,
these are they that write down the sins and the righteousness, the one on the right hand
writes down the righteousness, and the one on the left the sins. The angel like the sun,
holding the balance in his hand, is the archangel, Dokiel the just weigher, and he weighs the
righteousnesses and sins with the righteousness of God. The fiery and pitiless angel, holding
the fire in his hand, is the archangel Puruel, who has power over fire, and tries the works of
men through fire, and if the fire consume the work of any man, the angel of judgment immediately
seizes him, and carries him away to the place of sinners, a most bitter place of
punishment. But if the fire approves the work of anyone, and does not seize upon it, that
man is justified, and the angel of righteousness takes him and carries him up to be saved in
the lot of the just. And thus, most righteous Abraham, all things in all men are tried by fire
and the balance.”</p>
<p>XIV. And Abraham said to the chief-captain, My Lord the chief-captain, the soul which
the angel held in his hand, why was it adjudged to be set in the midst? The chief-captain
said, Listen, righteous Abraham. Because the judge found its sins. and its righteousnesses
equal, he neither committed it to judgment nor to be saved, until the judge of all shall come.
Abraham said to the chief-captain, And what yet is wanting for the soul to be saved? The
<pb n="363"/>
chief-captain said, If it obtains one righteousness above its sins, it enters into salvation.
Abraham said to the chief-captain, Come hither, chief-captain Michael, let us make prayer
for this soul, and see whether God will hear us. The chief-captain said, Amen, be it so; and
they made prayer and entreaty for the soul, and God heard them, and when they rose up
from their prayer they did not see the soul standing there. And Abraham said to the angel,
Where is the soul that thou didst hold in the midst? And the angel answered, It has been
saved by thy righteous prayer, and behold an angel of light has taken it and carried it up
into Paradise. Abraham said, I glorify the name of God, the Most High, and his immeasurable
mercy. And Abraham said to the chief-captain, I beseech thee, archangel, hearken to my
prayer, and let us yet call upon the Lord, and supplicate his compassion, and entreat his
mercy for the souls of the sinners whom I formerly, in my anger, cursed and destroyed,
whom the earth devoured, and the wild beasts tore in pieces, and the fire consumed through
my words. Now I know that I have sinned before the Lord our God. Come then, O Michael,
chief-captain of the hosts above, come, let us call upon God with tears that he may forgive
me my sin, and grant them to me. And the chief-captain heard him, and they made entreaty
before the Lord, and when they had called upon him for a long space, there came a voice
from heaven saying, Abraham, Abraham, I have hearkened to thy voice and thy prayer, and
forgive thee thy sin, and those whom thou thinkest that I destroyed I have called up and
brought them into life by my exceeding kindness, because for a season I have requited them
in judgment, and those whom I destroy living upon earth, I will not requite in death.</p>
<p>XV. And the voice of the Lord said also to the chief-captain Michael, Michael, my servant,
turn back Abraham to his house, for behold his end has come nigh, and the measure
of his life is fulfilled, that he may set all things in order, and then take him and bring him
to me. So the chief-captain, turning the chariot and the cloud, brought Abraham to his
house, and going into his chamber he sat upon his couch. And Sarah his wife came and
embraced the feet of the Incorporeal, and spoke humbly, saying, I give thee thanks, my Lord,
that thou hast brought my Lord Abraham, for behold we thought he had been taken up
from us. And his son Isaac also came and fell upon his neck, and in the same way all his
men-slaves and women-slaves surrounded Abraham and embraced him, glorifying God.
And the Incorporeal one said to them, Hearken, righteous Abraham. Behold thy wife Sarah,
behold also thy beloved son Isaac, behold also all thy men-servants and maid-servants round
about thee. Make disposition of all that thou hast, for the day has come nigh in which thou
shalt depart from the body and go to the Lord once for all. Abraham said, Has the Lord
said it, or sayest thou this of thyself? The chief-captain answered, Hearken, righteous Abraham.
The Lord has commanded, and I tell it thee. Abraham said, I will not go with thee.
The chief-captain, hearing these words, straightway went forth from the presence of Abraham,
<pb n="364"/>
and went up into the heavens, and stood before God the Most High, and said, Lord Almighty,
behold I have hearkened to Thy friend Abraham in all he has said to Thee, and have fulfilled
his requests. I have shown to him Thy power, and all the earth and sea that is under heaven.
I have shown to him judgment and recompense by means of cloud and chariots, and again
he says, I will not go with thee. And the Most High said to the angel, Does my friend Abraham
say thus again, I will not go with thee? The archangel said, Lord Almighty, he says
thus, and I refrain from laying hands on him, because from the beginning he is Thy friend,
and has done all things pleasing in Thy sight. There is no man like him on earth, not even
Job the wondrous man, and therefore I refrain from laying hands on him. Command,
therefore, Immortal King, what shall be done.</p>
<p>XVI. Then the Most High said, Call me hither Death that is called the shameless
countenance and the pitiless look. And Michael the Incorporeal went and said to Death,
Come hither; the Lord of creation, the immortal king, calls thee. And Death, hearing this,
shivered and trembled, being possessed with great terror, and coming with great fear it stood
before the invisible father, shivering, groaning and trembling, awaiting the command of the
Lord. Therefore the invisible God said to Death, Come hither, thou bitter and fierce name
of the world, hide thy fierceness, cover thy corruption, and cast away thy bitterness from
thee, and put on thy beauty and all thy glory, and go down to Abraham my friend, and take
him and bring him to me. But now also I tell thee not to terrify him, but bring him with
fair speech, for he is my own friend. Having heard this, Death went out from the presence
of the Most High, and put on a robe of great brightness, and made his appearance like the
sun, and became fair and beautiful above the sons of men, assuming the form of an archangel,
having his cheeks flaming with fire, and he departed to Abraham. Now the righteous Abraham
went out of his chamber, and sat under the trees of Mamre, holding his chin in his
hand, and awaiting the coming of the archangel Michael. And behold, a smell of sweet odor
came to him, and a flashing of light, and Abraham turned and saw Death coming towards
him in great glory and beauty. And Abraham arose and went to meet him, thinking that it
was the chief-captain of God, and Death beholding him saluted him, saying, Rejoice, precious
Abraham, righteous soul, true friend of the Most High God, and companion of the holy
angels. Abraham said to Death, Hail thou of appearance and form like the sun, most glorious
helper, bringer of light, wondrous man, from whence does thy glory come to us, and who
art thou, and whence comest thou? Then Death said, Most righteous Abraham, behold I
tell thee the truth. I am the bitter lot of death. Abraham said to him, Nay, but thou art the
comeliness of the world, thou art the glory and beauty of angels and men, thou art fairer in
form than every other, and sayest thou, I am the bitter lot of death, and not rather, I am
fairer than every good thing. Death said, I tell thee the truth. What the Lord has named
me, that also I tell thee. Abraham said, For what art thou come hither? Death said, For thy
<pb n="365"/>
holy soul am I come. Then Abraham said, I know what thou meanest, but I will not go with
thee; and Death was silent and answered him not a word.</p>
<p>XVII. Then Abraham arose, and went into his house, and Death also accompanied him
thither. And Abraham went up into his chamber, and Death went up with him. And Abraham
lay down upon his couch, and Death came and sat by his feet. Then Abraham said,
Depart, depart from me, for I desire to rest upon my couch. Death said, I will not depart
until I take thy spirit from thee. Abraham said to him, By the immortal God I charge thee
to tell me the truth. Art thou death? Death said to him, I am Death. I am the destroyer of
the world. Abraham said, I beseech thee, since thou art Death, tell me if thou comest thus
to all in such fairness and glory and beauty? Death said, Nay, my Lord Abraham, for thy
righteousnesses, and the boundless sea of thy hospitality, and the greatness of thy love towards
God has become a crown upon my head, and in beauty and great peace and gentleness I
approach the righteous, but to sinners I come in great corruption and fierceness and the
greatest bitterness and with fierce and pitiless look. Abraham said, I beseech thee, hearken
to me, and show me thy fierceness and all thy corruption and bitterness. And Death said,
Thou canst not behold my fierceness, most righteous Abraham. Abraham said, Yes, I shall
be able to behold all thy fierceness by means of the name of the living God, for the might
of my God that is in heaven is with me. Then Death put off all his comeliness and beauty,
and all his glory and the form like the sun with which he was clothed, and put upon himself
a tyrant’s robe, and made his appearance gloomy and fiercer than all kind of wild beasts,
and more unclean than all uncleanness. And he showed to Abraham seven fiery heads of
serpents and fourteen faces, (one) of flaming fire and of great fierceness, and a face of
darkness, and a most gloomy face of a viper, and a face of a most terrible precipice, and a
face fiercer than an asp, and a face of a terrible lion, and a face of a cerastes and basilisk.
He showed him also a face of a fiery scimitar, and a sword-bearing face, and a face of lightning,
lightening terribly, and a noise of dreadful thunder. He showed him also another face
of a fierce stormy sea, and a fierce rushing river, and a terrible three-headed serpent, and a
cup mingled with poisons, and in short he showed to him great fierceness and unendurable
bitterness, and every mortal disease as of the odor of Death. And from the great bitterness
and fierceness there died servants and maid-servants in number about seven thousand, and
the righteous Abraham came into indifference of death so that his spirit failed him.</p>
<p>XVIII. And the all-holy Abraham, seeing these things thus, said to Death, I beseech
thee, all-destroying Death, hide thy fierceness, and put on thy beauty and the shape which
thou hadst before. And straightway Death hid his fierceness, and put on his beauty which
he had before. And Abraham said to Death, Why hast thou done this, that thou hast slain
all my servants and maidservants? Has God sent thee hither for this end this day? Death
said, Nay, my Lord Abraham, it is not as thou sayest, but on thy account was I sent hither.
Abraham said to Death, How then have these died? Has the Lord not spoken it? Death
<pb n="366"/>
said, Believe thou, most righteous Abraham, that this also is wonderful, that thou also wast
not taken away with them. Nevertheless I tell thee the truth, for if the right hand of God
had not been with thee at that time, thou also wouldst have had to depart from this life.
The righteous Abraham said, Now I know that I have come into indifference of death, so
that my spirit fails, but I beseech thee, all-destroying Death, since my servants have died
before their time, come let us pray to the Lord our God that he may hear us and raise up
those who died by thy fierceness before their time. And Death said, Amen, be it so.
Therefore Abraham arose and fell upon the face of the ground in prayer, and Death together
with him, and the Lord sent a spirit of life upon those that were dead and they were made
alive again. Then the righteous Abraham gave glory to God.</p>
<p>XIX. And going up into his chamber he lay down, and Death came and stood before
him. And Abraham said to him, Depart from me, for I desire to rest, because my spirit is
in indifference. Death said, I will not depart from thee until I take thy soul. And Abraham
with an austere countenance and angry look said to Death, Who has ordered thee to say
this? Thou sayest these words of thyself boastfully, and I will not go with thee until the
chief-captain Michael come to me, and I shall go with him. But this also I tell thee, if thou
desirest that I shall accompany thee, explain to me all thy changes, the seven fiery heads of
serpents and what the face of the precipice is, and what the sharp sword, and what the loudroaring
river, and what the tempestuous sea that rages so fiercely. Teach me also the unendurable
thunder, and the terrible lightning, and the evil-smelling cup mingled with poisons.
Teach me concerning all these. And Death answered, Listen, righteous Abraham. For seven
ages I destroy the world and lead all down to Hades, kings and rulers, rich and poor, slaves
and free men, I convoy to the bottom of Hades, and for this I showed thee the seven heads
of serpents. The face of fire I showed thee because many die consumed by fire, and behold
death through a face of fire. The face of the precipice I showed thee, because many men die
descending from the tops of trees or terrible precipices and losing their life, and see death
in the shape of a terrible precipice. The face of the sword I showed thee because many are
slain in wars by the sword, and see death as a sword. The face of the great rushing river I
showed thee because many are drowned and perish snatched away by the crossing of many
waters and carried off by great rivers, and see death before their time. The face of the angry
raging sea I showed thee because many in the sea falling into great surges and becoming
shipwrecked are swallowed up and behold death as the sea. The unendurable thunder and
the terrible lightning I showed thee because many men in the moment of anger meet with
unendurable thunder and terrible lightning coming to seize upon men, and see death thus.
I showed thee also the poisonous wild beasts, asps and basilisks, leopards and lions and
lions’ whelps, bears and vipers, and in short the face of every wild beast I showed thee, most
righteous one, because many men are destroyed by wild beasts, and others by poisonous
snakes, serpents and asps and cerastes and basilisks and vipers, breathe out their life and
<pb n="367"/>
die. I showed thee also the destroying cups mingled with poison, because many men being
given poison to drink by other men straightway depart unexpectedly.</p>
<p>XX. Abraham said, I beseech thee, is there also an unexpected death? Tell me. Death
said, Verily, verily, I tell thee in the truth of God that there are seventy-two deaths. One is
the just death, buying its fixed time, and many men in one hour enter into death being given
over to the grave. Behold, I have told thee all that thou hast asked, now I tell thee, most
righteous Abraham, to dismiss all counsel, and cease from asking anything once for all, and
come, go with me, as the God and judge of all has commanded me. Abraham said to Death,
Depart from me yet a little, that I may rest on my couch, for I am very faint at heart, for
since I have seen thee with my eyes my strength has failed me, all the limbs of my flesh seem
to me a weight as of lead, and my spirit is distressed exceedingly. Depart for a little; for I
have said I cannot bear to see thy shape. Then Isaac his son came and fell upon his breast
weeping, and his wife Sarah came and embraced his feet, lamenting bitterly. There came
also his men slaves and women slaves and surrounded his couch, lamenting greatly. And
Abraham came into indifference of death, and Death said to Abraham, Come, take my right
hand, and may cheerfulness and life and strength come to thee. For Death deceived Abraham,
and he took his right hand, and straightway his soul adhered to the hand of Death. And
immediately the archangel Michael came with a multitude of angels and took up his precious
soul in his hands in a divinely woven linen cloth, and they tended the body of the just Abraham
with divine ointments and perfumes until the third day after his death, and buried him
in the land of promise, the oak of Mamre, but the angels received his precious soul, and ascended
into heaven, singing the hymn of “thrice holy” to the Lord the God of all, and they
set it there to worship the God and Father. And after great praise and glory had been given
to the Lord, and Abraham bowed down to worship, there came the undefiled voice of the
God and Father saying thus, Take therefore my friend Abraham into Paradise, where are
the tabernacles of my righteous ones, and the abodes of my saints Isaac and Jacob in his
bosom, where there is no trouble, nor grief, nor sighing, but peace and rejoicing and life
unending. (And let us, too, my beloved brethren, imitate the hospitality of the patriarch
Abraham, and attain to his virtuous way of life, that we may be thought worthy of the life
eternal, glorifying the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; to whom be glory and power forever.
Amen.).</p>

<head>Version II.</head>
<p>I. It came to pass, when the days of the death of Abraham drew near, that the Lord said
to Michael: Arise and go to Abraham, my servant, and say to him, Thou shalt depart from
life, for lo! the days of thy temporal life are fulfilled: so that he may set his house in order
before he die.</p>
<p>II. And Michael went and came to Abraham, and found him sitting before his oxen for
ploughing, and he was exceeding old in appearance, and had his son in his arms. Abraham,
therefore, seeing the archangel Michael, rose from the ground and saluted him, not knowing
who he was, and said to him: The Lord preserve thee. May thy journey be prosperous with
thee. And Michael answered him: Thou art kind, good father. Abraham answered and
said to him: Come, draw near to me, brother, and sit down a little while, that I may order
a beast to be brought that we may go to my house, and thou mayest rest with me, for it is
toward evening, and in the morning arise and go whithersoever thou wilt, lest some evil
beast meet thee and do thee hurt. And Michael enquired of Abraham, saying: Tell me thy
name, before I enter thy house, lest I be burdensome to thee. Abraham answered and said,
My parents called me Abram, and the Lord named me Abraham, saying: Arise and depart
from thy house, and from thy kindred, and go into the land which I shall show unto thee.
And when I went away into the land which the Lord showed me, he said to me: Thy name
shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham. Michael answered and said
to him: Pardon me, my father, experienced man of God, for I am a stranger, and I have
heard of thee that thou didst go forty furlongs and didst bring a goat and slay it, entertaining
angels in thy house, that they might rest there. Thus speaking together, they arose and went
towards the house. And Abraham called one of his servants, and said to him: Go, bring
me a beast that the stranger may sit upon it, for he is wearied with his journey. And Michael
said: Trouble not the youth, but let us go lightly until we reach the house, for I love thy
company.</p>
<p>III. And arising they went on, and as they drew nigh to the city, about three furlongs
from it, they found a great tree having three hundred branches, like to a tamarisk tree. And
they heard a voice from its branches singing, “Holy art thou, because thou hast kept the
purpose for which thou wast sent.” And Abraham heard the voice, and hid the mystery in
his heart, saying within himself, What is the mystery that I have heard? As he came into
the house, Abraham said to his servants, Arise, go out to the flocks, and bring three sheep,
and slay them quickly, and make them ready that we may eat and drink, for this day is a
feast for us. And the servants brought the sheep, and Abraham called his son Isaac, and
said to him, My son Isaac, arise and put water in the vessel that we may wash the feet of this
stranger. And he brought it as he was commanded, and Abraham said, I perceive, and so
it shall be, that in this basin I shall never again wash the feet of any man coming to us as a
<pb n="369"/>
guest. And Isaac hearing his father say this wept, and said to him, My father what is this
that thou sayest, This is my last time to wash the feet of a stranger? And Abraham seeing
his son weeping, also wept exceedingly, and Michael seeing them weeping, wept also, and
the tears of Michael fell upon the vessel and became a precious stone.</p>
<p>IV. When Sarah, being inside in her house, heard their weeping, she came out and said
to Abraham, Lord, why is it that ye thus weep? Abraham answered, and said to her, It is no
evil. Go into thy house, and do thy own work, lest we be troublesome to the man. And
Sarah went away, being about to prepare the supper. And the sun came near to setting, and
Michael went out of the house, and was taken up into the heavens to worship before God,
for at sunset all the angels worship God and Michael himself is the first of the angels. And
they all worshipped him, and went each to his own place, but Michael spoke before the Lord
and said, Lord, command me to be questioned before thy holy glory! And the Lord said to
Michael, Announce whatsoever thou wilt! And the Archangel answered and said, Lord,
thou didst send me to Abraham to say to him, Depart from thy body, and leave this world;
the Lord calls thee; and I dare not, Lord, reveal myself to him, for he is thy friend, and a
righteous man, and one that receives strangers. But I beseech thee, Lord, command the remembrance
of the death of Abraham to enter into his own heart, and bid not me tell it him,
for it is great abruptness to say, Leave the world, and especially to leave one’s own body, for
thou didst create him from the beginning to have pity on the souls of all men. Then the
Lord said to Michael, Arise and go to Abraham, and lodge with him, and whatever thou
seest him eat, eat thou also, and wherever he shall sleep, sleep thou there also. For I will
cast the thought of the death of Abraham into the heart of Isaac his son in a dream.</p>
<p>V. Then Michael went into the house of Abraham on that evening, and found them
preparing the supper, and they ate and drank and were merry. And Abraham said to his
son Isaac, Arise, my son, and spread the man’s couch that he may sleep, and set the lamp
upon the stand. And Isaac did as his father commanded him, and Isaac said to his father,
I too am coming to sleep beside you. Abraham answered him, Nay, my son, lest we be
troublesome to this man, but go to thy own chamber and sleep. And Isaac not wishing to
disobey his father’s command, went away and slept in his own chamber.</p>
<p>VI. And it happened about the seventh hour of the night Isaac awoke, and came to the
door of his father’s chamber, crying out and saying, Open, father, that I may touch thee
before they take thee away from me. Abraham arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered
and hung upon his father’s neck weeping, and kissed him with lamentations. And Abraham
wept together with his son, and Michael saw them weeping and wept likewise. And Sarah
hearing them weeping called from her bed-chamber, saying, My Lord Abraham, why is this
weeping? Has the stranger told thee of thy brother’s son Lot that he is dead? or has aught
else befallen us? Michael answered and said to Sarah, Nay, Sarah, I have brought no tidings
of Lot, but I knew of all your kindness of heart, that therein ye excel all men upon earth,

<pb n="370"/>
and the Lord has remembered you. Then Sarah said to Abraham, How durst thou weep
when the man of God has come in to thee, and why have thy eyes3993 shed tears for today
there is great rejoicing? Abraham said to her, How knowest thou that this is a man of God?
Sarah answered and said, Because I say and declare that this is one of the three men who
were entertained by us at the oak of Mamre, when one of the servants went and brought a
kid and thou didst kill it, and didst say to me, Arise, make ready that we may eat with these
men in our house. Abraham answered and said, Thou has perceived well, O woman, for I
too, when I washed his feet knew in my heart that these were the feet which I had washed
at the oak of Mamre, and when I began to enquire concerning his journey, he said to me, I
go to preserve Lot thy brother from the men of Sodom, and then I knew the mystery.</p>
<p>VII. And Abraham said to Michael, Tell me, man of God, and show to me why thou
hast come hither. And Michael said, Thy son Isaac will show thee. And Abraham said to
his son, My beloved son, tell me what thou hast seen in thy dream today, and wast frightened.
Relate it to me. Isaac answered his father, I saw in my dream the sun and the moon, and
there was a crown upon my head, and there came from heaven a man of great size, and
shining as the light that is called the father of light. He took the sun from my head, and yet
left the rays behind with me. And I wept and said, I beseech thee, my Lord, take not away
the glory of my head, and the light of my house, and all my glory. And the sun and the
moon and the stars lamented, saying, Take not away the glory of our power. And that
shining man answered and said to me, Weep not that I take the light of thy house, for it is
taken up from troubles into rest, from a low estate to a high one; they lift him up from a
narrow to a wide place; they raise him from darkness to light. And I said to him, I beseech
thee, Lord, take also the rays with it. He said to me, There are twelve hours of the day, and
then I shall take all the rays. As the shining man said this, I saw the sun of my house ascending
into heaven, but that crown I saw no more, and that sun was like thee my father. And
Michael said to Abraham, Thy son Isaac has spoken truth, for thou shalt go, and be taken
up into the heavens, but thy body shall remain on earth, until seven thousand ages are fulfilled,
for then all flesh shall arise. Now therefore, Abraham, set thy house in order, and thy
children, for thou hast heard fully what is decreed concerning thee. Abraham answered
and said to Michael, I beseech thee, Lord, if I shall depart from my body, I have desired to
be taken up in my body that I may see the creatures that the Lord my God has created in
heaven and on earth. Michael answered and said, This is not for me to do, but I shall go
and tell the Lord of this, and if I am commanded I shall show thee all these things.</p>
<p>VIII. And Michael went up into heaven, and spoke before the Lord concerning Abraham,
and the Lord answered Michael, Go and take up Abraham in the body, and show him all
<note type="footnote">3993 “Eyes of the fountain of light” is apparently what the text has.</note>
    
<pb n="371"/>
things, and whatsoever he shall say to thee do to him as to my friend. So Michael went forth
and took up Abraham in the body on a cloud, and brought him to the river of Ocean.</p>
<p>XII. And after Abraham had seen the place of judgment, the cloud took him down
upon the firmament below, and Abraham, looking down upon the earth, saw a man committing
adultery with a wedded woman. And Abraham turning said to Michael, Seest thou
this wickedness? but, Lord, send fire from heaven to consume them. And straightway there
came down fire and consumed them, for the Lord had said to Michael, Whatsoever Abraham
shall ask thee to do for him, do thou. Abraham looked again, and saw other men railing at
their companions, and said, Let the earth open and swallow them, and as he spoke the earth
swallowed them alive. Again the cloud led him to another place, and Abraham saw some
going into a desert place to commit murder, and he said to Michael, Seest thou this
wickedness? but let wild beasts come out of the desert, and tear them in pieces, and that
same hour wild beasts came out of the desert, and devoured them. Then the Lord God
spoke to Michael saying, Turn away Abraham to his own house, and let him not go round
all the creation that I have made, because he has no compassion on sinners, but I have
compassion on sinners that they may turn and live, and repent of their sins and be saved.</p>
<p>(VIII.) And Abraham looked and saw two gates, the one small and the other large, and
between the two gates sat a man upon a throne of great glory, and a multitude of angels
round about him, and he was weeping, and again laughing, but his weeping exceeded his
laughter seven-fold. And Abraham said to Michael, Who is this that sits between the two
gates in great glory; sometimes he laughs, and sometimes he weeps, and his weeping exceeds
his laughter seven-fold? And Michael said to Abraham, Knowest thou not who it is? And
he said, No, Lord. And Michael said to Abraham, Seest thou these two gates, the small and
the great? These are they which lead to life and to destruction. This man that sits between
them is Adam, the first man whom the Lord created, and set him in this place to see every
soul that departs from the body, seeing that all are from him. When, therefore, thou seest
him weeping, know that he has seen many souls being led to destruction, but when thou
seest him laughing, he has seen many souls being led into life. Seest thou how his weeping
exceeds his laughter? Since he sees the greater part of the world being led away through the
broad gate to destruction, therefore his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold.</p>
<p>IX. And Abraham said, And he that cannot enter through the narrow gate, can he not
enter into life? Then Abraham wept, saying, Woe is me, what shall I do? for I am a man
broad of body, and how shall I be able to enter by the narrow gate, by which a boy of fifteen
years cannot enter? Michael answered and said to Abraham, Fear not, father, nor grieve,
for thou shalt enter by it unhindered, and all those who are like thee. And as Abraham stood
and marveled, behold an angel of the Lord driving sixty thousand souls of sinners to destruction.
And Abraham said to Michael, Do all these go into destruction? And Michael said to
him, Yea, but let us go and search among these souls, if there is among them even one

<pb n="373"/>
righteous. And when they went, they found an angel holding in his hand one soul of a woman
from among these sixty thousand, because he had found her sins weighing equally with all
her works, and they were neither in motion nor at rest, but in a state between; but the other
souls he led away to destruction. Abraham said to Michael, Lord, is this the angel that removes
the souls from the body or not? Michael answered and said, This is death, and he
leads them into the place of judgment, that the judge may try them.</p>
<p>X. And Abraham said, My Lord, I beseech thee to lead me to the place of judgment so
that I too may see how they are judged. Then Michael took Abraham upon a cloud, and
led him into Paradise, and when he came to the place where the judge was, the angel came
and gave that soul to the judge. And the soul said, Lord have mercy on me. And the judge
said, How shall I have mercy upon thee, when thou hadst no mercy upon thy daughter
which thou hadst, the fruit of thy womb? Wherefore didst thou slay her? It answered, Nay,
Lord, slaughter has not been done by me, but my daughter has lied upon me. But the judge
commanded him to come that wrote down the records, and behold cherubim carrying two
books. And there was with them a man of exceeding great stature, having on his head three
crowns, and the one crown was higher than the other two. These are called the crowns of
witness. And the man had in his hand a golden pen, and the judge said to him, Exhibit the
sin of this soul. And that man, opening one of the books of the cherubim, sought out the
sin of the woman’s soul and found it. And the judge said, O wretched soul, why sayest thou
that thou hast not done murder? Didst thou not, after the death of thy husband, go and
commit adultery with thy daughter’s husband, and kill her? And he convicted her also of
her other sins, whatsoever she had done from her youth. Hearing these things the woman
cried out, saying, Woe is me, all the sins that I did in the world I forgot, but here they were
not forgotten. Then they took her away also and gave her over to the tormentors.</p>
<p>XI. And Abraham said to Michael, Lord, who is this judge, and who is the other, who
convicts the sins? And Michael said to Abraham, Seest thou the judge? This is Abel, who
first testified, and God brought him hither to judge, and he that bears witness here is the
teacher of heaven and earth, and the scribe of righteousness, Enoch, for the Lord sent them
hither to write down the sins and righteousnesses of each one. Abraham said, And how can
Enoch bear the weight of the souls, not having seen death? or how can he give sentence to
all the souls? Michael said, If he gives sentence concerning the souls, it is not permitted;
but Enoch himself does not give sentence, but it is the Lord who does so, and he has no
more to do than only to write. For Enoch prayed to the Lord saying, I desire not, Lord, to
give sentence on the souls, lest I be grievous to anyone; and the Lord said to Enoch, I shall
command thee to write down the sins of the soul that makes atonement and it shall enter
into life, and if the soul make not atonement and repent, thou shalt find its sins written
<pb n="374"/>
down and it shall be cast into punishment. And about the ninth hour Michael brought
Abraham back to his house. But Sarah his wife, not seeing what had become of Abraham,
was consumed with grief, and gave up the ghost, and after the return of Abraham he found
her dead, and buried her.</p>
<p>XIII. But when the day of the death of Abraham drew nigh, the Lord God said to Michael,
Death will not dare to go near to take away the soul of my servant, because he is my
friend, but go thou and adorn Death with great beauty, and send him thus to Abraham, that
he may see him with his eyes. And Michael straightway, as he was commanded, adorned
Death with great beauty, and sent him thus to Abraham that he might see him. And he sat
down near to Abraham, and Abraham seeing Death sitting near to him was afraid with a
great fear. And Death said to Abraham, Hail, holy soul! hail, friend of the Lord God! hail,
consolation and entertainment of travelers! And Abraham said, Thou art welcome, servant
of the Most High. God. I beseech thee, tell me who thou art; and entering into my house
partake of food and drink, and depart from me, for since I have seen thee sitting near to me
my soul has been troubled. For I am not at all worthy to come near thee, for thou art an
exalted spirit and I am flesh and blood, and therefore I cannot bear thy glory, for I see that
thy beauty is not of this world. And Death said to Abraham, I tell thee, in all the creation
that God has made, there has not been found one like thee, for even the Lord himself by
searching has not found such an one upon the whole earth. And Abraham said to Death,
How durst thou lie? for I see that thy beauty is not of this world. And Death said to Abraham,
Think not, Abraham, that this beauty is mine, or that I come thus to every man. Nay, but
if any one is righteous like thee, I thus take crowns and come to him, but if it is a sinner I
come in great corruption, and out of their sin I make a crown for my head, and I shake them
with great fear, so that they are dismayed. Abraham therefore said to him, And whence
comes thy beauty? And Death said, There is none other more full of corruption than I am.
Abraham said to him, And art thou indeed he that is called Death? He answered him and
said, I am the bitter name. I am weeping.…</p>
<p>XIV. And Abraham said to Death, Show us thy corruption. And Death made manifest
his corruption; and he had two heads, the one had the face of a serpent and by it some die
at once by asps, and the other head was like a sword; by it some die by the sword as by bows.
In that day the servants of Abraham died through fear of Death, and Abraham seeing them
prayed to the Lord, and he raised them up. But God returned and removed the soul of Abraham
as in a dream, and the archangel Michael took it up into the heavens. And Isaac
buried his father beside his mother Sarah, glorifying and praising God, for to him is due
glory, honor and worship, of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, now and always and to all
eternity. Amen.</p>

<head>The Acts of Xanthippe and Polyxena.</head>
    
<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The original Greek text of this work is edited for the first time in Text and Studies, Vol.
II., No. 3 (1893), by Montague Rhodes James, M.A., from the only ms. known to him, a
Paris one of the eleventh century. References to these Acts are not common in works dealing
with the saints of the early church, and few writers seem to have known the work itself.</p>
<p>In substance the Acts are a religious novel, similar in form, and to some extent in matter,
to the Greek romances by Achilles Tatius, Heliodorus, and others, and based upon the belief
that St. Paul actually did visit Spain, according to the intention expressed by him in Romans
xv. 24. The editor of the Greek text is inclined to assign its composition to about the middle
of the third century, reasoning from its relations to the Acts of Paul, and those of other
apostles, which its author apparently knew and made use of. Thus a knowledge of the Acts
of Paul and Thecla may be inferred from c. xxvi., of the Acts of Peter from c. xxiv., and of
those of Andrew from cc. xxviii.–xxxi.</p>
<p>The first and longest part of the story (from c. i. to xxi.) gives an account of the conversion
of Xanthippe, wife of Probus, a man of rank in Spain. In this part the narrative is less
prominent than the speeches and prayers, which are numerous, and of considerable length.
With c. xxii. a new section of the story begins, of which no previous warning has been given
except in the title, containing the adventures of Polyxena, the sister of Xanthippe, who is
carried off in the latter’s absence. The rest of the story is much more diversified than the
early part, being full of incident and introducing a great variety of persons—the apostles
Peter, Philip, and Andrew, an ass-driver, the Jewess Rebecca, a wicked prefect and his kindhearted
son, and finally Onesimus, who brings Polyxena back to Spain.</p>
<p>This difference in the character of the narrative in the two parts causes also some difference
in the language, which in the earlier section is more diffuse and more difficult of exact
translation than in the later one. The meaning of some words is also doubtful: those
translated “lamp-stand” and “destroyer,” towards the end of c. xxi., are so rendered in accordance
with suggestions by his Exc. M. Gennadius, who also characterises the language
of the text as full of errors.</p>

<head>Life and Conduct of the Holy Women, Xanthippe,
Polyxena, and Rebecca.</head>
<p>I. When the blessed Paul was at Rome through the word of the Lord, it happened that
a certain servant of a ruler of Spain came to Rome with letters of his master’s, and heard the
word of God from Paul, the truly golden and beautiful nightingale. This servant being
greatly touched, and being unable to remain and be filled with the divine word because he
was hastened by the letters, returned into Spain in great grief, and being unable to show his
desire to any one, because his master was an idolater, he was always pained at heart and
sighing greatly. Now this servant was honoured and faithful to his masters, and as time
went past, the servant fell sick and grew lean of flesh, which his master perceiving said to
him, What has happened to thee that thou art thus fallen together in countenance? The
servant said, here is a great pain in my heart, and I can in no way find rest. His master said
to him, And what is the pain that cannot receive healing from my chief physician? The
servant said, While I was still in Rome, this pain and its recurring mishap made itself known
to me. His master said, And knowest thou not of any who have fallen into this disease and
been healed? The servant said, Yes, but where that physician is I know not, for I left him
in Rome. So many as have been attended by that physician and have gone through the water
m his hands, have received healing immediately. His master said, I ought not to grudge to
send thee yet again to Rome, if perchance thou mightest obtain healing.</p>
<p>II. And while they spoke thus, behold his mistress, by name Xanthippe, overhearing
these words, and learning of the teaching of Paul, said, What is the name of that physician,
and what is the healing to ward off such a disease? The servant said to her, The calling upon
a new name, and anointing with oil and washing with water. By this treatment I have seen
many that had incurable pains receive healings. As he said this, the images of the idols that
stood in the house began to be shaken and fall down. And his mistress beckoned to him,
saying, Seest thou, brother, the images of the idols being shaken, how they cannot endure
the power of the word? And his master, by name Probus, arose from his mid-day sleep with
a very gloomy countenance, for the Devil had greatly disturbed him, because the knowledge
of God had come into his house. And he questioned the servant of everything in order, and
the servant having been seized by sickness by the foreknowledge of God, disclosed to him
the life of man, and Xanthippe was incurable in her soul concerning this teaching. So Probus
too was grieved for Xanthippe, because from that time she was wasting herself away with
waking and abstinence and other austerities.</p>
<p>III. And Xanthippe going away to her couch and groaning, said, Woe is me, wretched
one, lying in darkness, that I have not learned the name of the new teacher, that I might

<pb n="376"/>
summon his prayer to help me, and what to say I know not. Shall I call upon him by the
name of his God? but I cannot say, The God that is preached by such a one. Nevertheless
I shall say thus by conjecture, O God, giving light in Hades, and guiding those in darkness,
Lord of free men and kings, and preached by worthy servants in all the world, called upon
as a brother by sinful men and quick to hear, to whom not even archangels can send up
worthy songs of praise, who hast shown to me, humble and unworthy, the ever-living and
abiding seed (though my ignorance permits me not to receive it), hasten also the things that
concern me, Lord, since by thy will thou hast made thyself heard by me, and in thy compassion
show me the proclamation of thy herald, that I may learn of him what is pleasing to
thee. Yea, I beseech thee look upon my ignorance, O God, and enlighten me with the light
of thy countenance, thou that never overlookest any of those that call upon thee in truth.
Probus, her husband said to her, Why troublest thou thyself so much, lady, and dost not at
all turn to sleep? Xanthippe said, I cannot sleep, for there is in me an incurable pain. Probus
said to her, And what is thy pain or grief, O lady, that I am not sufficient to comfort thee?
All that thou hast wished unto this day I have served thee in, and now what is it that thou
hast, and dost not tell me? Xanthippe says to him, I beseech thee this thing only, my lord,
permit me for a little and for this day only to sleep apart from thee. And Probus said to her,
Be it as thou wilt, lady; only leave off thy groaning.</p>
<p>IV. Then entering into her bed-chamber alone, she spoke thus with tears, In what way,
my God, I shall act, or what counsel I shall take, I know not. Shall I declare the thought that
has come upon me? I fear the madness and disorder of the city. Shall I fly from this impious
city? I fear the contrivance of the devil for seizing the sheep. Shall I await the mercy and
swiftness of the Lord? Again I fear the untimely snatching away of life, for the death of
sinners has no warning. Shall I depart and flee away to Rome? I fear the length of the
journey, being unable to go on foot. But while I say these things by conjecture, constrained
by my desire (for I cannot speak with surety), may I find pardon with thee, my God, and
do thou fulfil my desire with excess of right words, and think me but worthy to hear thy
preacher, for if I say, to see his face, I ask a great thing. Blessed is he that is found in the
company of thy preachers, and is satisfied with their precious countenances. Blessed are
they that are yoked under the preaching of thy commandments. Blessed are they that keep
thy commandments; but where now, Lord, are thy mercies to our fathers, that we also may
be their successors in love toward thee and heirs of faith. But behold now, Lord, I cannot
find any one that has love for thee, that communing with him I might even a little refresh
my soul. Speed therefore, Lord, to yoke me in desire for thee, and keep me under the
shadow of thy wings, for thou alone art God, glorified to all eternity. Amen.</p>
<p>V. Therefore Xanthippe saying these words and others like them, groaned continually
all the night, and Probus heard her and was greatly distressed, and arising from his couch
when the morning came he went in to her, and seeing her eyes inflamed with tears, he said,

<pb n="377"/>
Wherefore, lady, dost thou thus vex me, and wilt not tell me thy pain? Tell it me, that I may
do whatever is pleasing to thee, and distress me not with thy trouble. Xanthippe says to
him, Be of good cheer rather, my lord, and be not vexed, for my trouble shall not harm thee,
but if I have found favour before thee, go forth now to the salutation, and allow me to indulge
myself in it as I will, for it is not possible for man to take from me the insatiable pain. And
listening to her he went out immediately to receive the salutations of the men of the city,
for he was the great man among them, and was also known to Nero, the Emperor. And
sitting down, great grief appeared in his countenance, and being asked the reason of his
grief by the chief men of the city, he said to them that he had fallen into many and unfounded
charges.</p>
<p>VI. And Xanthippe went out into the garden, that she might await there looking closely
for certainty of her husband, and she saw the delight of the trees, and the various warbling
of the birds, and said, groaning, O beauty of the world! for that which we hitherto thought
to come of itself, we know now that all things are beautifully fashioned by the beautiful One.
O power and invention of wisdom! for not only has he placed in men a thousand tongues,
but also in birds he has distinguished various voices, as if from anthems and responses to
receive sweet-voiced and heart-stirring hymns from his own works. O delightfulness of the
air, declaring the inimitable creator! Who shall turn my sorrow into rejoicing? And again
she said, God to whom praise is sung by all, give me peace and comfort. As she said these
things, Probus also came up from the street to break his fast, and when he saw her countenance
altered by tears, he began to pull out the hairs of his head, but he dared not speak to
her then so as not to mingle other trouble with her trouble. So he went and fell upon his
couch, and said, groaning, Alas, that I had not even the consolation of a child from her, but
only acquire grief upon grief. Two years are not yet full since I was wedded to her, and
already she meditates divorce.</p>
<p>VII. But Xanthippe was always keeping watch through the doors into the streets of the
city, and the blessed Paul, the preacher and teacher and illuminator of the world, left Rome
and came even into Spain by the fore-knowledge of God. And coming up to the gates of
the city he stood and prayed, and crossing himself entered the city. When Xanthippe saw
the blessed Paul walking quietly and equally, and adorned with all virtue and understanding,
she was greatly delighted in him and her heart leaped continually, and as possessed with an
unexpected joy she said with herself, Why does my heart beat vehemently at the sight of
this man? Why is his walk quiet and equable, as of one who expects to take in his arms one
that is pursued? Why is his countenance kindly, as of one that tends the sick? Why does
he look so lovingly hither and thither, as one who desires to assist those who are seeking to
flee from the mouths of dragons? Who shall tell me that this is one from the flock of
preachers? If it were possible for me, I should wish to touch the hem of his garments, that

<pb n="378"/>
I may behold his kindness and readiness to receive and sweet odour; for the servant had
told her this also, that the hems of his garments had the odour of precious perfumes.</p>
<p>VIII. Now Probus heard her words, and straightway ran out by himself into the street,
and laying hold of Paul’s hand said to him, Man, who thou art I know not, but deign to
enter into my house; perchance thou mayest be to me a cause of salvation. Paul said to him,
It will be well with thee, son, after thy request! And they went in together to Xanthippe.
When Xanthippe therefore saw the great Paul, the intellectual eyes of her heart were uncovered,
and she read upon his forehead, having as it were golden seals, these words, Paul
the Preacher of God. Then exulting and rejoicing she threw herself at his feet, and twisting
her hair together she wiped his feet, saying, Welcome, O man of God, to us humble ones,
that live as shadows among shadows. For thou hast looked upon those who were running
into Hades as into something beautiful, who addressed the crooked serpent and destroyer
as provider and protector, who were running into the dark Hades as to their father, those
that were fashioned with a rational nature but have become like irrational creatures. Thou
hast sought me, lowly one, having the sun of righteousness in my heart. Now the poison is
stayed, when I have seen thy precious face. Now he that troubled me is flown away, when
thy most beautiful counsel has appeared to me. Now I shall be considered worthy of repentance,
when I have received the seal of the preacher of the Lord. Before now I have deemed
many happy who met with you, but I say boldly that from this time forth I myself shall be
called happy by others, because I have touched thy hem, because I have received thy prayers,
because I have enjoyed thy sweet and honeyed teaching. Thou hast not hesitated to come
to us, thou that fishest the dry land in thy course, and gatherest the fish that fall in thy way
into the net of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>IX. The great Paul said to her, Arise, daughter, and look not upon me as having been
sought out of thy ignorance by my foresight. For Christ, the provider of the world, the
searcher out of sinners and the lost, who has not only called to mind those upon earth, but
also by his own presence has redeemed those in Hades, he himself has pitied thee, and sent
me hither that he might visit and pity many others together with thee. For this mercy and
visitation are not of us, but are his injunction and command, even as we also have received
mercy and been saved by him. Probus hearing this was astonished at their words, for he
was altogether ignorant of these things. But Paul by force raised up Xanthippe from his
feet, and she running set a new gilded chair for Paul to sit down upon. The great Paul said
to her, My daughter Xanthippe, do not thus, for ye have not yet accorded to the faith of
Christ, but wait a little, till the Lord shall set in order what is necessary! Xanthippe said to
Paul, Sayest thou this to try me, O preacher of God, or hast thou any foreknowledge? Paul
said, No, daughter, but the devil, who hates the servants of God, sows wickedness in the
hearts of his own servants, to oppose those that labour for Christ in preaching, for his
wickedness has extended to the apostles and even to the Lord himself. Therefore it is fitting

<pb n="379"/>
to approach the unbelievers gently and kindly! Xanthippe said to Paul, I beseech thee, if
thou lovest thy servants, make prayer for Probus, and let me see if he that is hated by thee
can work in him; let me see if he can even stand against thy prayer. And Paul rejoiced exceedingly
at the words of her faith, and said to her, Believe me, daughter, that by his suggestion
and working I have not passed a single hour without chains and blows. Xanthippe said
to him, But thou sufferest these things by thy own free will, since thou hast not neglected
thy preaching even to scourging, but this again I tell thee, that thy bonds shall be the defeat
of the prompter, and thy humiliation their overthrow.</p>
<p>X. Now the report of his presence ran through the whole city and the country round
about, for some of that city having been at Rome had seen the signs and wonders that were
done by the blessed Paul, and came to see if this was he. Many therefore came into the house
of Probus, and he began to be annoyed and to say, I will not suffer my house to be made an
inn. Xanthippe knowing that the face of Probus had begun to be estranged, and that he
spoke thus, was greatly distressed, saying, Alas, wretched me, that we are not thought fully
worthy to keep this man in our house; for if Paul goes hence, the church also will be held
elsewhere. Then Xanthippe, considering these matters, put her hand on the foot of Paul,
and taking dust she called Probus to her, and placing her hand on his breast said, O Lord,
my God, who hast sought out me, lowly one and ignorant of thee, send what is fitting into
this heart. And Paul perceived her prayer, and made the sign of the cross, and for several
days the people entered unhindered, and as many as had sick and vexed by unclean spirits
brought them, and all were healed.</p>
<p>XI. And Xanthippe said to Paul, Teacher, my heart is greatly consumed because I have
not as yet received baptism. And after this Probus being again moved by the devil, cast Paul
out of the house and shut up Xanthippe in her chamber. Then one of the chief men,
Philotheus by name, besought the great Paul to come into his house, but the great Paul was
unwilling to do so, saying, Lest Probus trouble thy house on my account. Philotheus said
to him, Nay, father, I am not at all subject to him, for in no other thing is he greater than
me, except in rank, and that because the parents of Xanthippe are above me. But if Probus
come to me, I am above him in riches and in war. Then Paul, the great apostle of the Lord,
was persuaded, and went into the house of Philotheus the ex-prefect. All this was done by
the Evil one that Xanthippe might receive holy baptism with tribulation, and be faint-hearted
concerning the commandments of Christ.</p>
<p>XII. Xanthippe therefore, with tears, said to her servants, Have ye learned where Paul
is gone to? They said, Yea, in the house of Philotheus the ex-prefect, and Xanthippe rejoiced
greatly that Philotheus also believed, being able, as she said, to persuade Probus also. Then
Probus called Xanthippe to supper, and when she consented not, Probus said, Think not
that in bed also thou wilt keep away from me. But when he lay down to supper, Xanthippe
bending her knees, prayed to the Lord, saying, Eternal and immortal God, that didst take

<pb n="380"/>
dust from the ground, and didst not value it according to the nature of its creation, but didst
call it the son of immortality, thou who didst come from the heart of the father to the heart
of the earth for our sake, on whom the cherubim dare not fix their gaze, and for us wast
hidden in the womb that by taking up thy abode in a mother thou mightest make good the
offence of Eve. Thou that didst drink gall and vinegar, and wast pierced in the side by a
spear, that thou mightest heal the wound given by the rib to Adam. For Eve being his rib
wrought a blow for Adam, and through him for all the world. Thou that gavest a sleep
without perception to the serpent, so that he might not know thy Incarnation, remember
also my groaning and tears, and grant fulfilment to my sleep,3994 and bring sleep upon
Probus until I shall be deemed worthy of the gift of holy baptism, for I vehemently desire
to obtain this, to the glory and praise of thy holy name.</p>
<p>XIII. But Probus, while still at supper, commanded the doors of their house to be secured
by cruel and wicked soldiers, and having given these orders, he straightway fell asleep upon
the couch. Then the servants came and announced this to Xanthippe that he might be
awakened, but she said, Put out the lights, my children, and leave him thus. And in the first
sleep, taking three hundred pieces of gold, she went to the doors, saying with herself, Perchance
the porter will be persuaded by the amount of money. But he, being evil and froward,
would not be persuaded to do this, and she, loosing also her girdle, which was set with precious
stones and worth two hundred pieces of gold, gave it to him and went out saying,
Lord, I win over my own slaves with money, that thy preacher Paul may not be oppressed
by Probus. And Xanthippe went on to the house of Philotheus the ex-prefect, as to a great
and incredible work, running and praising God. As she therefore passed through a certain
place, the demons pursued her with fiery torches and lightnings, and she, turning, saw behind
her this terrible sight, and being possessed with great fear said, What has happened to thee
now, wretched soul? Thou hast been deprived of thy desire. Thou wast running to salvation,
thou wast running to baptism, and thou hast fallen into the serpent and his ministers, and
these things thy sins have prepared for thee. Speaking thus she was even fainting at heart
from great despair, but the great Paul being forewarned by God of the assault of the demons,
immediately stood beside her, being also preceded by a beautiful youth. And straightway
the vision of the demons disappeared, and Paul said to her, Arise, daughter Xanthippe, and
behold the Lord desired by thee, by whose flame the heavens are shaken and the deep is
dried up, coming to thee and pitying and saving thee. Behold him that accepts thy prayers
and straightway gives ear. See him coming in the shape of a man, and take courage against
the demons. Then she rising from the ground said to him, Master, why hast thou left me
solitary? Even now make haste to seal me, so that if death come upon me I may depart to
him who is full of compassion and has no arrogance.</p>
<note type="footnote">3994 So the text; perhaps “prayer” ought to be read.</note>

<pb n="381"/>
<p>XIV. Therefore the great Paul straightway taking her hand, went into the house of
Philotheus, and baptised her in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Then taking bread also he gave her the eucharist saying, Let this be to thee for a remission
of sins and for a renewing of thy soul. Then the blessed Xanthippe, receiving the divine
grace of holy baptism, returned to her own house, rejoicing and praising the Lord. The
porter seeing her complained loudly in violent words, that her going out might be deemed
to have been without his will if Probus should notice it; but he that gave her light along with
Paul kept the whole house, together with Probus, in a deep sleep, and they did not hear his
words at all. Then she went running into her bed-chamber, saying, What shall I say of thee,
searcher out of sinners, who art most present with us in tribulations. Thy goodness does
these things, since for the sake of man whom thou didst make thou didst go down even to
death, for, however much man stir thee to anger many times, yet thou, Lord, pourest out
thy mercies upon him. O depth of compassion and wealth of mercy; O immeasurable
goodness and incomparable kindness; O treasure of good things, and giver of mercy, and
enricher of all that believe in thee! If, therefore, one who loves thee say, Be near me, Lord,
thou hast already anticipated him. If he say, I give thee thanks; hear my words, before they
are spoken, thou understandest. And as for those that ask of thee, thou givest to each after
his asking. Thy goodness seeks out those that know thee not, and thou runnest to sinners.
O cheerful look, filling the ways of sinners with mercy; O excellent watching and exhortation
of the ignorant! Who shall tell my lord Paul of the salvation that has now befallen me, that
he might come and give words of thanksgiving for me to this protector of sinners? Come
many and behold and know the Lord, who hates sin, but has mercy on sinners. Come, now,
O Paul, preacher of God, for with thee even now I sit under instruction, and give words of
thanksgiving for me, for I desire to keep silence, since human reason makes me afraid, lest
I have not the grace of eloquence. I desire to keep silence, and am compelled to speak, for
some one inflames and sweetens me within. If I say, I will shut my mouth, there is some
one that murmurs in me. Shall I say a great thing? Is it not that teacher that is in Paul,
without arrogance, filling the heavens, speaking within and waiting without, sitting on the
throne with the father and stretched upon the cross by man. What, therefore, I shall do I
know not. My worthless mind delights me, and is not unfolded to the end. Thou that hadst
thy hands fixed with nails and thy side pierced with the spear, thou star out of Jacob and lion’s
whelp out of Judah, thou rod out of Jesse, and man and God out of Mary, thou invisible
God in the bosom of the Father, and that canst not be looked upon by cherubim, and art
mocked in Israel, glory be to thee, who didst appear on the earth and wast taken by the
people, hung upon the tree and by the report of the wicked falsely said to be stolen, and that
hast bought us all together.</p>
<p>XV. While she was still speaking thus, there appeared a cross on the eastern wall, and
straightway there entered through it a beautiful youth, having round about him trembling

<pb n="382"/>
rays, and under him an extended light, on which also he walked. And as he entered within,
all the foundations of that house shook and sounded with a great trembling. Xanthippe
seeing him cried out and fell to the ground as if dead; but he being pitiful and kind, changing
immediately into the shape of Paul, raised her up, saying, Arise, Xanthippe, and fear not,
for the servants of God are thus glorified. Then Xanthippe arising, gazed upon him, and
thinking it to be Paul said, How art thou come in hither, preacher of God, seeing that I have
given five hundred pieces of gold to the porter, and that although he is my slave, while thou
hast no money? The Lord said to her, My servant Paul is richer than all wealth, for whatsoever
treasure he acquires here he sends it before him into the kingdom of heaven, that departing
thither he may rest in the unending and eternal rest. This is the treasure of Paul,
thou and thy like. Then Xanthippe gazing upon him, desirous to say something, saw his
face shining as the light; and being greatly amazed, and putting both her hands over her
face she threw herself to the ground, and said, Hide thyself, Lord, from my bodily eyes and
enlighten my understanding, for I know now who thou art. Thou art he whose precursor
was the cross, the only begotten son of the Father alone above, and only son of the Virgin
alone below. Thou art he who was pierced in the hands and who rent the rocks. Thou art
he whom none other can carry except the bosom of the Father.</p>
<p>XVI. And as she spoke thus the Lord was again hidden from her, and Xanthippe,
coming to herself, said, Woe is me wretched one, that no one has told me what is the gratitude
of slaves towards their master. If Paul the preacher of the Lord were here, how could he
give praise? But perchance in the face of such favors and gifts they are silent, possessed only
with tears, for it is not possible worthily to praise any one according to his favour. Saying
this she was seized with great faintness from lack of food, for having been strongly possessed
with desire for Christ she had forgotten to take nourishment. Therefore, being greatly exhausted
by abstinence and the vision and want of sleep and other austerities, she was unable
to rise from the ground.</p>
<p>XVII. And Probus arose from his couch with a very gloomy countenance, for in his
sleep he had seen a dream, and was greatly troubled concerning it. But the porter seeing
him about to issue to the market-place, having his countenance thus troubled, was greatly
afraid, Lest, said he, he know what has happened, and will miserably destroy me. Probus,
however, having gone forth and signified to those in the market what was fitting for the day
and season, speedily returned into the house, and said to his servants, Call me quickly the
wise men Barandus and Gnosteas. When they were summoned he said to them, I have seen
a very terrible vision, and what appeared in it is difficult for our power to interpret. This,
however, do ye disclose to me, as being the most excellent of all the world. Expound it to
me when I tell it you. Barandus says to him, If the vision can be interpreted by our wisdom,
we shall explain it to thee, but if it be of the faith that is now spoken of we cannot expound
it to thee, for it is of another wisdom and understanding. However, let our lord and master

<pb n="383"/>
tell the dream, and let us see if there is any explanation for it. Probus says to Gnosteas,
Wherefore answerest thou nothing? Gnosteas said, I have not heard the dream, and what
can I say but whatever it may be, if it is by reason of Paul? Tell me now, and thou wilt find
it so. Probus said, I thought I was standing in a certain unknown and strange country, and
that there sat there an Ethiop king, who ruled over all the earth and seemed never to have
any successor. There stood beside him multitudes of servants, and all hastened to destruction
and had mastery far and wide. And when that Ethiop seemed to have gained his purpose,
there arose a raven and standing above him croaked with a pitiful voice. And straightway
there arose from the eastern parts an eagle, and seized his kingdom, and his power was made
vain, and those standing by him fled to the eagle. Then that king strove against those that
fled to the eagle, but the eagle carried it up into heaven, and, behold, there came a helper to
those that fled to the eagle and left his staff to them. Then they laying hold of it were not
overcome by the violence of that king. So many as ran to those who had the staff, he washed
them in pure water, and they that were washed had power over his kingdom. And by that
staff the enemies of the king were put to flight, therefore capable men laying hold of the
staff turned to themselves great multitudes. And that king strove against them, and had no
might at all, but he hindered many from believing in him that sent out the men into the
world to bear witness, and for that reason many were grieved. Nevertheless, this one did
not constrain any like the other, for he himself was ruler of all light. This then was the end.</p>
<p>XVIII. Then the wise Barandus said, By the grace of God I shall tell the things sent into
the world by the Lord. The king whom thou sawest is the Devil, and the multitudes of his
servants are the demons, and the throngs about him are they that worship the gods.
Whereas he thought to have no successor, he looked not for the coming of Christ. The
raven betokened the weakness of his kingdom, for the raven kept not obedience to the
righteous Noah, but loved pitiful things. The eagle that arose and took away his kingdom
and carried it up into heaven, and that there came a protector of those that fled to the eagle,
having a staff, that is the Lord Jesus Christ, who left to them his staff, that is, his precious
cross; and that he washed those that fled to him signifies the invulnerable breast-plate of
baptism, and therefore they were not overcome. The capable men sent into the world with
the cross are the preachers of God like Paul who is now with us, against whom that king has
no power. This was made known to thee because even on those who are hard of belief God
has compassion in some way. See therefore whether even thou wilt be able to injure Paul
though thou desirest, for the mighty power that shields him has been shown thee by the
Lord. Therefore, understand what has been said to thee by me, and serve not that king of
darkness, for as thou sawest his kingdom vanish away, so shall all his servants perish with
him. Come now, therefore, my Lord, let us go to Paul and receive baptism from him, lest
Satan have mastery over us also. Probus said, Let us first go to Xanthippe and see whether

<pb n="384"/>
she still lives, for behold there are twenty-nine days since she has tasted anything; for I saw
her face in the evening, and it was as of one prepared to depart.</p>
<p>XIX. And as they went into the chamber, they heard her singing.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord ye sinners also, because he accepts your prayers also. Alleluia.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord ye that have despaired like me, for many are his mercies. Alleluia.</p>
<p>Praise him ye ungodly, because for you he was crucified. Alleluia.</p>
<p>Praise him ye that strive for the salvation of sinners, because God loves you. Alleluia.</p>
<p>Praise him, ye that rejoice at the calling of sinners, because ye are fellow-citizens with
the saints. Alleluia.</p>
<p>As she said these words and more than these with tears, the wise men Barandus and
Gnosteas opening the door entered and fell at her feet, saying, Pray for us lowly ones, O
servant of Christ, that he may bring us also into thy number. But she said to them, Brethren,
I am not Paul who remits sins, but neither is he far from you. Therefore fall not before my
knees, but go to him, who is also more able to benefit you. Then they came running to the
house of Philotheus to Paul, and found him teaching a great multitude. And Probus also
came to hear Paul, and Xanthippe entered along with him to salute him, and coming near
to Paul and bending her knees she did him reverence. Probus seeing this marvelled that
her so proud spirit had changed to so great humility, for she sat beside the feet of Paul on
the ground humbly and as one of the worthless. And Probus was greatly grieved, not yet
attending to the hearing of the word, but was ever gazing and fixing his attention on
Xanthippe.</p>
<p>XX. The great Paul was teaching thus, Let those that burn in the flesh observe lawful
marriage, avoiding fornication, especially that with another’s wife, and let those that are
united keep to one another. Probus heard this teaching with delight, and said, O Paul, how
excellently and wisely thou employest this teaching. Why then has Xanthippe withdrawn
from me? And Paul said, My son Probus, they that foresee that the works of men shall be
tried with fire, and that have always in their mind the inexorableness of death, cast out all
desire that cleaves to the flesh. But woe when the desire shall judge him that desired, then
he shall gnash his teeth to no effect and in vain, for the amendment of repentance is past.
Hearing this Probus went up into his house marvelling, and tasted nothing that day, but
went and lay down upon his bed. And about the third hour of the night he arose and said,
Alas, how wretched was the day in which I was wedded to Xanthippe. Would that I had
died and not seen her. Saying this he arose and said, I shall pray to the God of Paul. Perchance
he will do to me also what is fitting, that I may not become a reproach in the world,
being rejected by her. And straightway falling upon the ground he said, O God of Paul, if,
as I have heard from Xanthippe, thou dost seek after the ignorant and turn back those that
are astray, do to me also what is fitting; for thou art the king of life and death, as I have

<pb n="385"/>
heard, and hast dominion over things in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and over
all the thoughts and desires of men, and to thee alone belongs glory to all eternity. Amen.</p>
<p>XXI. Then Probus arising from the ground fell again upon the couch, and arising early
he came to Paul, and finding him baptising many in the name of the life-giving Trinity, he
said, My lord Paul, if only I were worthy to receive baptism, behold the hour. Paul said to
him, Son, behold the water is ready for the cleansing of those that come to Christ. Therefore
immediately taking off his garments, and Paul laying hold of him, he leapt into the water,
saying, Jesus Christ, son of God, and everlasting God, let all my sins be taken away by this
water. And Paul said, We baptise thee in the name of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost.
After this he made him to receive the eucharist of Christ. Then Xanthippe, being greatly
rejoiced, began in the house toward evening together with her husband to give good cheer
to all those in the house, and to prepare a feast, and when they came, after giving orders for
the supper to be magnificent she herself went up to the chamber. And behold on the stairs
a demon coming in the likeness of one of the actors, and standing in a dark corner, was
desirous to frighten and terrify Xanthippe. But she thinking it to be the actor that she ordinarily
had, said in anger, Many a time have I said to him that I no longer care for toys, and
he despises me as being a woman; and straightway seizing an iron lamp-stand, she hurled
it at his face, and crushed all his features. Then the demon cried out, saying, O violence,
from this destroyer even women have received power to strike us. But Xanthippe was greatly
afraid.</p>
<p>XXII. After supper then Probus went forth to hear the word, but Xanthippe sitting in
her bed-chamber was reading the prophets, her sister Polyxena lying upon the couch.
Xanthippe loved Polyxena exceedingly, because she was younger than herself, and beautiful
in appearance, and Probus also loved her greatly. And as Polyxena lay upon the couch she
saw this dream, that a dragon, hideous in appearance, came and signified to her to come to
him, and when she did not obey him to go to him, he came running and swallowed her.
From fear of this the girl leapt up trembling, and Xanthippe running to her said, What has
happened to thee, dearest, that thou hast leapt up thus suddenly? She for a long time was
unable to speak; then coming to herself she said, Alas, my sister Xanthippe, what danger or
tribulation awaits me, I know not; for I saw in my dream that a hideous dragon came and
signed to me to go to him, and, when I would not go, he came running and swallowed me,
beginning at my feet. While I was terrified at this, there suddenly spoke out of the air, in
the light of the sun, a beautiful youth, whom I thought to be the brother of Paul, saying,
Verily, thou hast no power. Who also took me by the hand and straightway drew me out
of him, and straightway the dragon disappeared. And behold his hand was full of sweet
odour as of balsam or aught else for fragrance. Xanthippe said to her, Truly thou must be
greatly troubled, my sister Polyxena, but God has thee dear, seeing that he has shown thee

<pb n="386"/>
strange and marvellous things. Therefore arise quickly in the morning and receive the holy
baptism, and ask in the baptism to be delivered from the snares of the dragon.</p>
<p>XXIII. Xanthippe, having said this to Polyxena, and having made a cross of wood, went
to Paul, but Polyxena remained alone in the bed-chamber, her nurse having gone together
with Xanthippe. And about the middle of the night, a certain man, powerful in wealth and
assistance, finding the doors open and using magical arts, entered within, desiring to carry
away Polyxena. She discovering this fled into the mill, but the magicians led by the demons
found her. And she, not finding any door to escape by, said, Alas that I am given over to
this destroyer; for she had heard that he was at enmity with her suitor, and he did this to
assail and vex him, being a man who was a robber and exceeding cruel. Therefore seizing
her they went out of the city, dragging her to the sea. She looked round this way and that,
but there was none to deliver her, and groaning she said, Alas, my sister Xanthippe, thou
didst send seven hundred pieces of gold to Rome and buy books, that through them thou
mightest prophesy by me; for this evening thou didst read, I looked to my right hand and
beheld, but there was no one that knew me; flight perished from me and there is no one that
seeketh out my soul.3995</p>
<p>XXIV. While she said these words, those that were dragging her away walked in haste,
and coming to the shore they hired a ship and sailed for Babylonia, for he that carried her
off had a brother there, a ruler of a district. But the wind blew against them, so that they
could not proceed by reason of it, and as they were rowing on the sea, behold the great
apostle of the Lord, Peter, was sailing past in a ship, being urged by a dream to go to Rome,
because when Paul departed for Spain there had entered into Rome a certain deceiver and
magician, Simon by name, and had broken up the church which Paul had established. And,
behold, as he journeyed he heard a voice from heaven saying to him, Peter, to-morrow there
will meet thee a ship coming from Spain; arise, therefore, and pray for the soul that is troubled
in it. As soon therefore as Peter saw the ship, remembering the dream, he said, O Jesus,
that hast care for the troubled, whom the tribulation of those in a strange land moves to
compassion, whom the weeping of those in captivity made to come upon the earth, who
givest us at all time whatsoever we desire, and never turnest away from our request, show
now also pity and assistance to the soul that is tossed about in that ship, because thou, O
Lord, pitiest at all time those in pain. The demons then, perceiving his prayer, said to the
magicians, Avoid ye the course of that ship, for if we meet with it, we cannot move.</p>
<p>XXV. But the loving God taking care for Polyxena, the vessel arrived in Greece, the
blessed Philip being there, and having come down to the shore by a vision, and there accompanied
him also great multitudes of those who were being taught by him. And behold the
vessel wherein was Polyxena appeared, terribly tossed about. And the blessed Philip said,
<note type="footnote">3995 Psalm 142. 4.</note>

<pb n="387"/>
Behold the vessel on account of which we came down here, in which there is a soul in trouble.
When the vessel arrived and all had disembarked upon the dry land, they lay as half dead,
because they had been greatly tossed about in the sea. But the apostle Philip ordered Polyxena
to be lifted and taken to the place where he was lodging, and the rest to be looked to.
But he that had carried off Polyxena, recovering from the disorder of the sea, was desirous
to take her again, for Philip, having entrusted Polyxena to one of those that were taught by
him, went on his way rejoicing. But he that had her said, She was committed to me by a
holy man, and I cannot give her up to thee. He, however, giving no heed to him and finding
there a kinsman of his, a nobleman, prepared for war, gathering eight thousand men.
Polyxena, knowing this, went forth by night and departed, but he that had charge of Polyxena
said, Taking the tunic of Philip, I shall go forth alone to meet them; but as he said this it was
announced to him that the maid was not there. Then he, leaving all thought of the war, ran
into the bed-chamber, and not finding the maid threw himself on the ground, saying, Woe
is me, wretched one, that have become an enemy of Philip. What shall I answer him, when
he asks the maiden from me? His servants came and said to him, Arise, our lord, from the
ground, for the forces have surrounded thy house, and the maid cannot be found. He said,
Leave me thus to die on her account. Perhaps, even by this, Philip the servant of Christ may
be fully satisfied, since I shall be found despising his command. Then the servants, seeing
that he heeded them not, took counsel to flee from the enemies, but again after a little, being
moved by the foreknowledge of God, they said, It is not right for our master to die. Come,
let us go forth to meet them, raising the sign of the cross. Then raising the precious cross
they went forth, about thirty men, upon the enemy, and slew five thousand, and the rest
fled. And they returned with victory to their master, praising God and saying, What God
is so great as our God, who has not suffered his servant to be slain by the wicked? And
coming upon their lord, still weeping, they said to him, Arise, lord, and weep not, for it befits
it to be not as we will, but as the Lord wills.</p>
<p>XXVI. Polyxena, however, going out of the city, and not knowing by what way she
should walk, found herself in desert places of the hills, and sitting down said thus with tears,
Woe is me, outcast and captive, that I cannot find even a wild beast’s den to rest in. Woe
is me, left desolate, that not even Hades, that no one escapes, has devoured me. Woe is me,
who at one time showed myself not even to my servants, and now display myself to demons.
Woe is me, that I am now made manifest to all those by whom I disdained to be seen. Alas
for me that was formerly devoted to idols; for this now even the mercy of God has passed
me in silence. Whom, then, shall I call upon to help me? The God of Paul whom I have
constantly offended? But who shall help me now? No one sees or heeds or hears my
groaning. Verily I shall beseech Him that sees the hidden things, for who is more pitiful
and compassionate than He who always keeps watch over the oppressed? But because my
mouth is unclean and defiled, I dare not ask help from Him. Would that I were as one of

<pb n="388"/>
the wild beasts that I might not know what captivity is. Would that I had been drowned in
the sea; perhaps having received the divine baptism I should have gone where no one is
made captive. What then shall I do, for death delays, and night has come on, and there is
no help anywhere. Having said thus, she arose and began to walk onwards, and passing
through a small defile she fell into a wood very thick and large, and finding there a hollow
in a tree, which was the den of a lioness, she sat down there, for the lioness had gone forth
for her food. And sitting down she said, O wretched begetting, O grievous hour in which
I, unhappy one, came into this world; O mother that bore me, why, foreseeing my troubles
and wanderings, didst thou name me Polyxena? Has any other ever fallen into such tribulations
and misfortunes? Truly, my sister Xanthippe, didst thou read concerning me, unhappy
one, saying, I have suffered affliction and been utterly bowed down (—Psalm xxxviii.
6). These words thou didst utter with grief, while I lay upon the couch, thinking not at all
of my sorrows. On this account I have now come into the depths of evils, and pass the night
in deserts like a wild beast. But the beasts live with others of their kind, while I am left solitary,
as not being of one race with mankind.</p>
<p>XXVII. And as she was saying these words, and more than these, the morning dawned,
and the lioness came from her hunting. Polyxena, seeing the wild beast, trembled and said,
By the God of Paul, O wild beast, have compassion on me and tear me not until I receive
baptism. And the wild beast, fearing the adjuration, immediately went away, and standing
afar off gazed at her. And she said, Behold, the beast has obeyed me; I will also retire from
its dwelling. And immediately she began to journey towards the east, and the beast went
before her until she was come out of the wood. Then Polyxena said, What shall I give to
thee in return, O beast? The God of Paul will repay thee this kindness; and the wild beast,
hearing her prayer, immediately returned to its place. Then she, descending, found a public
road, and standing on it wept, not knowing whither she should go, and though many went
past, she turned to none of them, but said, Perchance the God of Paul will remember me,
and whoever shall have pity upon me, to him will I go.</p>
<p>XXVIII. As she said this, Andrew, the apostle of the Lord, also came journeying to that
place, and as he drew near to Polyxena he felt in his heart some commotion arising in himself.
Standing, therefore, to pray, and folding his arms in the shape of the cross, he said, Lord
Jesus Christ, partaker of light and knower of things hidden, from whom nothing on earth
is hid, do unto me kindness and mercy, and make clear to me this commotion of heart, and
calm my reason, thou that makest peace always with those that love peace. Then Polyxena
ran to him, and Andrew, the apostle of the Lord, said to her, Approach me not, daughter,
but tell me who and whence thou art. Polyxena said, My lord, I am a stranger here, but I
see thy face is gracious, and thy words as the words of Paul, and I suppose thee to be of the
same God. Andrew understood that she spoke of the apostle Paul, and said to her, And
whence dost thou know of Paul? She said, From my own country, for I left him in Spain.

<pb n="389"/>
Andrew said to her, And how happenest thou to be here, the country being far distant? She
said, Because it was thus appointed for me, and came to pass; but I beseech thee and fall at
thy feet, seal me, as Paul seals, by the baptism of regeneration, so that even I, lowly one, may
be known by our God, for the kind God, seeing my tribulation and distress, sent thee to pity
me. Andrew, the great apostle of the Lord, said to her, Let us go, daughter, where there is
water.</p>
<p>XXIX. And when they had gone no long way, they came to a well most transparent and
pure. And as the blessed Andrew stood to pray beside the well, behold a certain maiden
named Rebecca, of the tribe of Israel, brought as a captive to that country, came to draw
water at the well, and seeing the blessed Andrew, knew him by his appearance. For Rebecca
said, This is the appearance of a Prophet, and this is one of the apostles. And bowing down
to him she said, Have mercy on me, servant of the true God, who am captive and sold for
the third time, who was once honored by prophets, and am now insulted by idolaters, and
recall me, lowly one, thou that wast sent to call back many sinners. Andrew, the apostle of
Christ, said, God will care for thee also, daughter, as well as for this stranger. Therefore,
receive ye now baptism, and be ye as of one people, glorifying God always.</p>
<p>XXX. Therefore the apostle standing prayed, and, behold, the lioness came running,
and stood gazing upon him. And Andrew the apostle of the Lord said, What then does this
beast wish? The lioness opening her mouth spoke with a human voice, Andrew, apostle of
Christ, the prayer of her, that stands on thy right hand, has overtaken me. Therefore confirm
thou and instruct and admonish them in the right and true faith of Christ, for they greatly
desire the name of the Lord. And, behold, the wonderful condescension of God, that even
on irrational and untamable beasts he has poured out his mercy. The blessed Andrew
weeping said, What shall I say or what shall I speak concerning thy mercy, O God, that thus
thou at all times cleavest to the lowly, and takest care for those in ignorance, being without
arrogance and full of mercy? And having completed the prayer he baptised the maidens in
the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Then the lioness immediately set off to the
mountain, and the Apostle Andrew said to the maidens, Be zealous, daughters, to be of good
repute before God by living well in a strange land, and separate not from each other, and
God, that is always present to those that call upon him, keep you in holiness, driving away
from you the Evil One. And pray ye also for me. Polyxena said, We will follow thee
whithersoever thou goest. The Apostle Andrew said, This was not made known to me by
the Lord, daughters; therefore remain with peace, hoping in the Lord, and he will preserve
you to the end.</p>
<p>XXXI. And Andrew went his way rejoicing and glorifying God. Then said Polyxena,
Whither shall we go, sister? Rebecca said, Let us depart whither thou wilt, lest my mistress
send and separate us. Polyxena said, Come, let us depart into the mountain to the lioness.
Rebecca said, It is indeed better for us to live with wild beasts and perish of hunger than to

<pb n="390"/>
be compelled by Greeks and idolaters to fall into the filth of marriage. So they began to
journey, and, behold, by the providence of God, they met a man driving asses, who seeing
them said, Ye are not of this country, and, as I see, ye wear not its dress. Command therefore
of your servant to eat bread and receive one piece of silver that ye may remember your servant
when ye buy bread. And he made haste and took the sacks off his asses and spread them
on the ground, and made the maidens to sit upon them and said to them, Seeing that the
wine which your servant carries is gathered by Greeks, tell me of what faith ye are, that thus
we may taste of it. Polyxena said, We, brother, taste no wine, and are of the God of Paul.
The ass-driver said. Is this God upon earth? Polyxena said to him, God is everywhere, both
in heaven and on earth. The ass-driver, being desirous to learn clearly, said, Does this Paul
then have the same God that is preached by Philip? Polyxena, learning that he was a
Christian, said, Yea, brother, this is the God of all, whom Paul and Philip preach.</p>
<p>XXXII. The ass-driver hearing this wept unceasingly, and Polyxena said, Has then the
providence of God overtaken thee, that thou weepest thus? The ass-driver said, If thou art
desirous to learn wherefore I weep, hear the truth, for one ought not to grudge to tell the
things of Christ. I was a disciple of Philip, the apostle of Christ, and seeing how all his
thought was towards the poor, I took all that I had and sold it. And taking the price, I bought
bread and wine, and divided them throughout the cities to those that had need, when
therefore I had done this for some time in the neighbouring city, a certain maimed person
cried out, saying (though it was not himself that spoke, but Satan through his mouth), I
desire nothing, I take nothing from thee, because thou art a Christian. Then the whole city
arose against me and sought to take me, but some ran one way and some another, while I
go through their midst and no one sees me. And issuing from the city I gave praise and
glory to God that thus I had been rewarded, and I prayed to my God that I should meet
some one who knew his all-holy name, so that relating these things I might obtain relief.
For the men of this country will not hear at all concerning Christ, being full of impiety and
filled with wickedness. I exhort you therefore, take ye also one coin from me, and if it seem
good, take ye rest also upon the asses. Polyxena said, Mayest thou obtain mercy from God,
brother. But if thou wilt receive a full reward, save us as far as the sea, so that, if God wills,
we may sail for Spain.</p>
<p>XXXIII. The ass-driver, as if commanded by the voice of God, eagerly receiving the
maidens, went on his way rejoicing in the Lord. And he said to Polyxena, Alter thy appearance
to that of a man, lest for thy beauty’s sake some one snatch thee away from me. And
coming to an inn, they stayed there, and on the morrow they went forward taking heed to
the way. And behold there came past a certain prefect journeying to Greece, who seeing
the maidens ordered Polyxena to be carried off on his chariot. Then the ass-driver followed,
crying and saying, A prefect does violence to none. Why do ye this? Then they beat him
and drove him away.</p>

<pb n="391"/>
<p>XXXIV. And he going on his way lamented, saying, Woe is me, wretched and abominable
one. Woe is me that thought to do good, but now I have wrought mischief. Woe is
me that my trouble and my running were unacceptable. Would that I had died before yesterday,
that I might not have met with these maidens at all. But why troublest thou me, O
wretched soul? Let us go to Philip the apostle of God. If there is not forgiveness for me, it
is better for me to choose death in whatsoever fashion than to live with such evil and bitter
conscience. So he went and found Philip the apostle of Christ, and said to him, O disciple
and preacher of Christ, thus and thus it has happened to me and befallen me. Has my soul
salvation? Philip the apostle of Christ said, Be not distressed concerning this, my son, it is
impossible for them to be dishonoured, seeing that no one ever overcomes God; for this
same Polyxena, when she first came from the sea, I entrusted to a certain brother, who also
was greatly distressed because of her running away secretly from his house. Him also I
persuaded not to grieve, for through her tribulation and wanderings many shall know God.</p>
<p>XXXV. The prefect therefore carried Polyxena to the city where he stayed, and ordered
her to be shut up in a chamber. And one of the soldiers seized Rebecca, but the maid secretly
escaping fled into the house of an old woman, who received the maiden kindly and entreated
her well. And sitting down she wept, saying, Alas, my sister Polyxena, I wretched one did
not think that anyone was oppressed like myself, but now I am persuaded and know that
all my misfortunes and tribulations do not compare with one day of thine. And most
grievous of all, behold I have been separated from thee and am again a captive, but do thou
search for me even into the next world, my sister Polyxena. The old woman said to her,
What ails thee, daughter, that thou weepest thus bitterly? Rebecca said, Suffer me, mother,
to be distressed and to lament the great and incurable pain of my heart. The old woman
greatly compassionating her wept exceedingly, for the maid had told her all that had happened
to her, and how through Polyxena she had believed in Christ. So too Polyxena, shut up in
the chamber, said, Woe is me, wretched one; alas for me miserable one; now I know clearly
how the devil hates virginity, but O Lord Jesus Christ, God of all, since I dare not beseech
thee of myself, I bring to thee the prayers of thy holy preacher Paul, that thou mayst not
suffer my virginity to be destroyed by any one.</p>
<p>XXXVI. And as she was yet praying, the attendants came to lead her to the couch of
the prefect. But Polyxena said to them, Brethren, make not haste to any one’s destruction,
for this time shall quickly pass away, and they that work together with the destroyers shall
perish with them. Rather assist strangers, that ye be not found strangers to the angels of
God. The men, being shamed by these words, went to the prefect and said, The maid from
fear is seized with a violent fever. And the prefect said, Let her alone. And, behold, the son
of the prefect came to Polyxena by night, and she seeing him was afraid, but the youth said
to her, Fear not, girl. I seek not to be wedded with thee as the bridegroom of destruction,
for I know from thy prayer that thou art the bride of the God of heaven. I know this God

<pb n="392"/>
who is never overcome by any one, for a certain man of glorious countenance lately in Antioch
preached this God, and a certain maid, whose name was Thecla, believing him followed
him, and encountered dangers on account of her beauty, of whom I have heard that she was
condemned to the wild beasts. I therefore continually gazed upon the man, and he having
observed me said to me, God give heed to thee, my son. From that time therefore by the
grace of Christ I have not gone into the sacrifices of idols, but sometimes feigning illness
and sometimes involving myself in some business, my father said to me, Because thou hast
no zeal for the sacrifices of the gods, therefore neither art thou in health, not being worthy
of the gods. But I rejoiced, hearing that I was not worthy of the sacrifices to idols; and, by
the grace of God, art thou come hither as a providence to me. Polyxena said, And what is
the name of that man? The youth said, Paul is his name. Polyxena said, He is in my city.
The youth said, Come then, girl, put on my appearance, and go down to the shore and wait
me there; I having taken money will come quickly.</p>
<p>XXXVII. And one of the servants overhearing them told all this to the prefect, who
being filled with great anger condemned them to be cast to the wild beasts. And when they
were cast into the arena, a fierce lioness was let loose upon them, which ran and embraced
the feet of Polyxena, and licked the soles of her feet. Then the prefect and all the city, seeing
this fearful and wonderful sight, gave praise and glory to the merciful God, saying, Of a
truth thou art, and he, that is named by Polyxena, alone is God, for the gods of the heathen
are the works of men’s hands, unable to save or assist any one. Let them perish now, both
themselves and their makers. And the prefect straightway taking his son and Polyxena into
the palace, heard from them in order the faith and religion in Christ without omission, and
he and all in the city believed, and there was great joy and giving of glory to God. And
Polyxena said to the prefect, Be of good cheer, my lord, for the man of God will quickly
come, who will perfectly teach, exhort, instruct, and enlighten you in the knowledge of
Christ. She however prepared in all haste to depart into Spain.</p>
<p>XXXVIII. And as I, Onesimus, was sailing into Spain to Paul, I received from the Lord
a revelation saying to me, Onesimus, the vessel in which thou now art will land in the parts
of Greece, and thou wilt find on the shore of the harbour two maids and one youth. Assist
them and take them to Paul. When we reached this place according to the command of the
Lord, we found the maids together with the youth seeking a vessel. When the maids saw
us therefore, they knew that we were of the hope of Christ, and Polyxena running to us said,
Verily the man of God cannot be concealed, for the grace and kindliness of his countenance
makes him manifest. And when we sought to sail away, the sea was troubled by the
providence of God. And there was with us a disciple of Paul, by name Lucius, capable in
word to teach the city. Therefore we remained seven days, and God opened to that place a
great door of faith, and twenty thousand believed, and there was great joy and rejoicing in

<pb n="393"/>
all the city. And when the season was favourable for us to sail the prefect again constrained
us, and we stayed another seven days, until all believed and rejoiced in the Lord.</p>
<p>XXXIX. Thus now by the foreknowledge of Christ, the prefect sent us away with supplies
for the voyage, sending also his son with us. And when we had sailed twenty days, Polyxena
was greatly exhausted, and we touched at a certain island for the sake of rest. And behold,
certain fierce and hardened men, coming down to us and seeing Polyxena, prepared for
battle; but by the grace of Christ our men defended Polyxena and vanquished them, although
the strangers were more numerous and more powerful. Polyxena therefore fearing again
to become a captive threw herself into the sea; but the pilot dragged her out, having suffered
no harm. Then we embarked in the vessel and fled, for the places were rough and wooded,
and we were afraid to remain, and in twelve days we arrived in Spain, by the grace of God.</p>
<p>XL. And Paul seeing us rejoiced greatly, and said, Welcome ye that have been troubled.
And Polyxena, laying hold of his feet, said, It may be that this trouble came upon me because
I would have blasphemed thee, but now I beseech and entreat that I may not again be delivered
into such troubles and misfortunes. And Paul said, weeping, Thus must we be
troubled, my daughter, that we may know our defender, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>XLI. And while we were giving the letters of the brethren to Paul, one ran and told
Xanthippe of the arrival of Polyxena. And she made haste and came to us, and seeing
Polyxena, was overcome by an unspeakable joy and fell to the ground; but Polyxena embracing
her and caressing her for a long time brought her back to life. Then Xanthippe said to
her, I, my true sister Polyxena, went not forth at all for forty days, praying much for thee to
the loving God, that thy virginity might not be taken away. And Paul, the preacher of God,
said to me, Her virginity will not be taken away, and she will come quickly. And Probus
said to me, It was assigned to her by God to be thus afflicted. Seest thou how by many
devices God saves many? But now, my beloved sister, having unexpectedly seen thy face,
now I shall willingly die.</p>
<p>XLII. Then he who had carried her away came up again and sought for Polyxena, but
the great Paul persuaded him to refrain from her, and he also believed and was baptised by
Paul, as also the suitor of Polyxena believed, and there was great joy in all that city of Spain
for the recovery of Polyxena. From that time forward she left not at all the blessed Paul in
her fear of temptations. These things then being thus, all rejoiced in the Lord, glorifying
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, one God, to whom is glory and power, now and ever and to
all eternity. Amen.</p>

<head>The Narrative of Zosimus.</head>
    
<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The Greek text of this work is printed for the first time in the same part of “Texts and
Studies” as the Acts of Xanthippe and Polyxena. The sources for it are two manuscripts—one
in Paris, belonging to the twelfth century, and the other in Oxford, dating from the fifteenth
or sixteenth. The latter, however, only extends to the close of c. viii., the copy used by the
scribe having been imperfect. There are versions of the work in Slavonic, Syriac, Ethiopic,
and Arabic; in the former of these the Blessed Ones are called the Brachmani.</p>
<p>From two passages in the poems of Commodian (c. 250 a.d.) it would seem that the
work was known in his day, and the canon of Nicephoras (c. 850 a.d.) places it among certain
apocryphal books which are to be rejected. At the same time, it is doubtful whether, in its
present form, it can be put as far back as the earlier of these dates.</p>
<p>It professes to be the account of a visit to the Makares, or Blessed Ones, given by a hermit,
Zosimus, who was privileged to visit them. For forty years he had abstained from bread
and wine and from seeing the face of man, always praying to be permitted to see the life of
the Blessed. With the second chapter the narrative begins in the first person, and is continued
in this up to c. xxi., just where the angels come to receive the soul of Zosimus, and the work
is then finished off by one of the hermits who were present at his last moments.</p>
<p>While the style is inelegant and sometimes obscure, the matter of the book is very interesting,
and shows considerable powers of imagination. The land of the Blessed is reached
by means of a camel, which comes from the desert, and then by a storm of wind, which
carries Zosimus along with it. He is addressed by the river to which he comes, as well as by
the wall of cloud which rises above it, and is finally lifted across it by two trees. The origin
of the Blessed Ones is noteworthy, as connecting the story with early literature on the Lost
Tribes. They are the descendants of Rechab in the days of Jeremiah the prophet, who, for
refusing to give up their observances, are cast into prison by the king. From this they are
delivered by an angel, and brought to the place they now inhabit,—a level land covered with
flowers,—a view of Paradise which continues all through the Middle Ages. The chapters
(x.–xv.) in which the Blessed describe their life and death are of special merit, and form the
best part of the whole. In striking contrast to its lofty tone is the appearance of Satan with
his 1360 demons, whom Zosimus finally overcomes and drives away.</p>

<p>To the various accounts of the Earthly Paradise, the story of Zosimus forms an important
addition; on these it may, either directly or indirectly, have had considerable influence, although
the difficulty of assigning a definite date to it makes this very uncertain.</p>

<head>The Narrative of Zosimus Concerning the Life of the
Blessed.</head>
<p>I. About that time there was in the desert a certain man named Zosimus, who for forty
years ate no bread, and drank no wine, and saw not the face of man. This man was entreating
God that he might see the way of life of the blessed, and behold an angel of the Lord was
sent saying to him, Zosimus, man of God, behold I am sent by the Most High, the God of
all, to tell thee that thou shalt journey to the blessed, but shalt not dwell with them. But
exalt not thy heart, saying, For forty years I have not eaten bread, for the word of God is
more than bread, and the spirit of God is more than wine. And as for thy saying, I have not
seen the face of man, behold the face of the great king is nigh thee. Zosimus said, I know
that the Lord can do whatsoever he will. The angel said to him, Know this also, that thou
art not worthy of one of their delights, but arise and set out.</p>
<p>II. And I, Zosimus, issuing from my cave with God leading me, set out not knowing
which way I went, and after I had travelled forty days my spirit grew faint and my body
failed, and being exhausted I sat down, and continued praying in that place for three days.
And, behold, there came a beast from the desert, whose name is the camel, and placing its
knees on the ground, it received me upon its neck and went into the desert and set me down.
There there was much howling of wild beasts, and gnashing of teeth, and deadly poison.
And becoming afraid, I prayed to the Lord, and there came in that place a great earthquake
with noise, and a storm of wind blew and lifted me from the earth, and exalted me on its
wing, and I was praying and journeying till it set me upon a place beside a river, and the
name of the river is Eumeles. And behold when I desired to cross the river, some one cried
as if from the water, saying, Zosimus, man of God, thou canst not pass through me, for no
man can divide my waters: but look up from the waters to the heaven. And looking up I
saw a wall of cloud stretching from the waters to the heaven, and the cloud said, Zosimus,
man of God, through me no bird passes out of this world, nor breath of wind, nor the sun
itself, nor can the tempter in this world pass through me.</p>
<p>III. And I was astonished at these words, and at the voice that spake these things to
me. And as I prayed, behold two trees sprang up out of the earth, fair and beautiful, laden
with fragrant fruits. And the tree on this side bent down and received me on its top, and
was lifted up exceedingly above the middle of the river, and the other tree met me and received
me in its branches and bending down set me on the ground; and both trees were lifted
up and set me away from the river on the other side. In that place I rested three days, and
arising again I went forward, whither I knew not, and that place was filled with much fra-

<pb n="397"/>
grance, and there was no mountain on either hand, but the place was level and flowery, all
crowned with garlands, and all the land beautiful.</p>
<p>IV. And I saw there a naked man sitting, and said in myself, Surely this is not the
tempter. And I remembered the voice of the cloud that it said to me, Not even the tempter
in this world passes through me. And thus taking courage I said to him, Hail, brother. And
he answering said to me, The grace of my God be with thee. Again I said to him, Tell me,
man of God, who thou art? He answered and said to me, Who art thou rather? And I
answered and told him all concerning myself, and that I had prayed to God and he had
brought me into that place. He answered and said to me, I also know that thou art a man
of God, for if not, thou couldst not have passed through the cloud and the river and the air.
For the breadth of the river is about thirty thousand paces, and the cloud reaches to heaven,
and the depth of the river to the abyss.</p>
<p>V. And having ended this discourse the man spoke again, Hast thou come hither out
of the vanity of the world? I said to him, Wherefore art thou naked? He said, How knowest
thou that I am naked? Thou wearest skins of the cattle of the earth, that decay together with
thy body, but look up to the height of heaven and behold of what nature my clothing is.
And looking up into heaven I saw his face as the face of an angel, and his clothing as lightning,
which passes from the east to the west, and I was greatly afraid, thinking that it was the son
of God, and trembled, falling upon the ground. And giving me his hand he raised me up,
saying, Arise, I also am one of the blessed. Come with me, that I may lead thee to the elders.
And laying hold of my hand he walked about with me and led me toward a certain crowd,
and there were in that crowd elders like sons of God, and young men were standing beside
the elders. And as I came near to them, they said, This man has come hither out of the
vanity of the world; come, let us beseech the Lord and he will reveal to us this mystery.
Surely the end is not at hand, that the man of vanity is come hither? Then they arose and
besought the Lord with one accord, and behold two angels came down from heaven and
said, Fear not the man, for God has sent him, that he may remain seven days and learn your
ways of life, and then he shall go forth and depart to his own place. The angels of God
having said this ascended into heaven before our eyes.</p>
<p>VI. Then the elders of the blessed gave me over to one of the attendants, saying, Keep
him for seven days. So the attendant receiving me led me to his cave, and we sat under a
tree partaking of food. For from the sixth hour even to the sixth, then we ate, and the water
came out from the root of the tree sweeter than honey, and we drank our fill, and again the
water sank down into its place. And all the country of those there heard of me, that there
had come thither a man out of the vanity of the world, and all the country was stirred up,
and they came to see me because it seemed strange to them. Therefore they were asking
me all things and I was answering them, and I became faint in spirit and in body, and besought
the man of God that served me, and said, I beseech thee, brother, if any come to see

<pb n="398"/>
me, tell them He is not here, so that I may rest a little. And the man of God cried out saying,
Woe is me, that the story of Adam is summed up in me, for Satan deceived him through
Eve, and this man by his flattery desires to make me a liar while he is here. Take me away
from hence, for I shall flee from the place. For behold he wishes to sow in me seeds of the
world of vanity. And all the multitude and the elders rose up against me, and said, Depart
from us, man; we know not whence thou art come to us. But I lamented with great lamentation,
and my senses left me, and I cried out to the elders, saying, Forgive me, my lords, and
the elders stilled them and made quietness. Then I related to them all from the beginning
till that time, and said, I besought the Lord to come to you, and he deemed me worthy. And
the elders said, And now what wilt thou we should do to thee? I said to them, I desire to
learn of you your way of life.</p>
<p>VII. And they rejoiced with great joy, and taking up tables of stone they wrote on them
with their nails, thus, Hear, ye sons of men, hear ye us who are become blessed, that we also
are of you; for when the prophet Jeremiah proclaimed that the city of Jerusalem should be
delivered into the hands of the destroyers, he rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his
loins, and sprinkled dust upon his head, and took earth upon his bed, and told all the people
to turn from their wicked way. And our father Rechab, the son of Aminadab, heard him
and said to us, Ye sons and daughters of Rechab, hearken to your father, and put off your
garments from your body, and drink no vessel of wine, and eat no bread from the fire, and
drink not strong drink and honey until the Lord hear your entreaty. And we said, All that
he has commanded us we shall do and hearken. So we cast away our clothing from our
bodies, and we ate no bread from the fire, and drank no vessel of wine nor honey nor strong
drink, and we lamented with a great lamentation and besought the Lord, and he heard our
prayer and turned away his anger from the city of Jerusalem, and there came to the city of
Jerusalem mercy from the Lord, and he pitied its people, and turned away his deadly anger.</p>
<p>VIII. And after these things the king of the city of Jerusalem died, and there arose another
king. And all the people gathered to him and informed him concerning us, and said,
There are certain of thy people, who have changed their way from us. Therefore the king
summoned them, and asked them wherefore they had done this; and he sent for us and
asked, Who are ye and of what worship and of what country? And we said to him, We are
the sons of thy servant, and our father is Rechab the son of Jonadab, and when Jeremiah
the prophet preached in the days of thy father the king, he proclaimed death to the city of
Jerusalem, saying, Yet three days and all the city shall be put to death. And the king thy
father hearing this repented of his sins, and issued a command to all to turn aside from their
wicked way. And our father thy servant hearing it charged us, saying, Drink no vessel of
wine, and eat no bread from the fire, until the Lord shall hear your entreaty. And we
hearkened to the commandment of our father, and made naked our bodies, we drank no
wine and ate no bread, and we prayed to the Lord for the city of Jerusalem, and the Lord

<pb n="399"/>
pitied his people and turned away his anger, and we saw it and our soul was rejoiced, and
we said, It is good for us to be so.</p>
<p>IX. And the king said to us, Ye have done well. Now therefore mingle with my people,
and eat bread and drink wine, and glorify your Lord, and ye shall be serving God and the
king. But we said, We will not disobey God. Then the king was enraged and set us in prison,
and we passed that night there. And behold a light shone in the building, and an angel uncovered
the prison and laid hold of the crowns of our heads, and took us out of the prison,
and set us beside the water of the river, and said to us, Whithersoever the water goes, go ye
also. And we travelled with the water and with the angel. When therefore he had brought
us to this place, the river was dried up and the water was swallowed up by the abyss, and he
made a wall round this country, and there came a wall of cloud, and shadowed above the
water; and he did not scatter us over all the earth, but gave to us this country.</p>
<p>X. Hear, ye sons of men, hear the way of life of the blessed. For God placed us in this
land, for we are holy but not immortal. For the earth produces most fragrant fruit, and out
of the trunks of the trees comes water sweeter than honey, and these are our food and drink.
We are also praying night and day, and this is all our occupation. Hear, ye sons of men;
with us there is no vine, nor ploughed field, nor works of wood or iron, nor have we any
house or building, nor fire nor sword, nor iron wrought or unwrought, nor silver nor gold,
nor air too heavy or too keen. Neither do any of us take to themselves wives, except for so
long as to beget two children, and after they have produced two children they withdraw
from each other and continue in chastity, not knowing that they were ever in the intercourse
of marriage, but being in virginity as from the beginning. And the one child remains for
marriage, and the other for virginity.</p>
<p>XI. And there is no count of time, neither weeks nor months nor years, for all our day
is one day. In our caves lie the leaves of trees, and this is our couch under the trees. But we
are not naked of body, as ye wrongly imagine, for we have the garment of immortality and
are not ashamed of each other. At the sixth hour of every day we eat, for the fruit of the tree
falls of itself at the sixth hour, and we eat and drink our fill, and again the water sinks into
its place. We also know you who are there in the world, and who are in sins, and your works,
for every day the angels of the Lord come and tell them to us, and the number of your years.
But we pray for you to the Lord, because we also are of you and of your race, except that
God has chosen us, and has set us in this place without sin. And the angels of God dwell
with us every day, and tell us all things concerning you, and we rejoice with the angels over
the works of the just, but over the works of sinners we mourn and lament, praying to the
Lord that he may cease from his anger and spare your offences.</p>
<p>XII. But when the time of the forty days comes, all the trees cease from their fruits, and
the manna that he gave to our fathers rains down from heaven, and the manna is sweeter
than honey. Thus we know that the season of the year is changed. But when the time of

<pb n="400"/>
the holy passover comes, then again the trees put forth fragrant fruit, and thus we know
that it is the beginning of the year. But the feast of the resurrection of the Lord is performed
with much watching, for we continue watching for three days and three nights.</p>
<p>XIII. We know also the time of our end, for we have no torment nor disease nor pain
in our bodies, nor exhaustion nor weakness, but peace and great patience and love. For our
soul is not troubled by the angels to go forth, for the angels rejoice when they receive our
souls, and the souls also rejoice with the angels when they behold them; as a bride receives
the bridegroom, so our soul receives the announcement of the holy angels, saying nothing
more than only this, The Lord calls thee. Then the soul quits the body and goes to the angels,
and the angels seeing the soul coming forth spotless rejoice, and spreading out their robes
receive it. Then the angels call it blessed, saying, Blessed art then, O soul, because the will
of the Lord is fulfilled in thee.</p>
<p>XIV. The time of our life is this. If one quits the body in his youth, the days of his life
here are three hundred and sixty years, and he that quits the body in old age, the days of his
life here are six hundred and eighty-eight years. And the day of our completion is made
known to us by the angels, and when the angels of God come to take us, we go with them,
and the elders, seeing the angels, gather together all the people and we depart together with
the angels, singing psalms, until the angels arrive at the place of our abode. And because
we have no tools, the angels of God themselves make the grave for our body, and thus he
that is called by God goes down, and all salute him from small to great, sending him on his
way and bidding him farewell. Then the soul quits the body and the angels receive it, but
we see the shape of the soul as a shape of light, perfect in all the body apart from the distinction
of male and female.</p>
<p>XV. Then the angels taking it up sing a song and hymn, making melody to God, and
again other troops of angels come in haste to meet them, saluting the soul that is coming
and entering into the firmaments. And when it has come to the place where it is to worship
God, the son of God himself, together with the angels, receives the soul of the blessed one
and bears it to the undefiled father of the ages, and again, when the angels sing above, we
being below listen to them, and again we sing and they listen in heaven above, and thus
between us and the angels there arises a giving of praise in hymns. But when the soul of the
blessed one, falling upon its face, worships the Lord, then we also falling down worship the
Lord in that same hour, and when the Lord raises it up then we also arise; and when it goes
to its appointed place, we also go into the church, fulfilling the eucharist of the Lord.
Having written these things, and all the life of the blessed, we gave them to our brother
Zosimus, and escorted him as far as the place of trees beside the river Eumeles.</p>
<p>XVI. And I, Zosimus, besought again the blessed ones to make entreaty for me to the
Lord that the trees might receive me to take me across. And they all cried to the Lord and
said, O God that hast shown us thy marvels and hast made thy servant Zosimus to come to

<pb n="401"/>
us out of the world of vanity, set him again in his own place with peace, and command these
trees to bow down and take up thy servant and set him on the further side. And as they
finished their prayer, the trees straightway bent down before them, and received me as on
the second day before; and being set on the other side of the river I cried with a loud voice
and said, Men of righteousness, who are brothers of the holy angels, grant me your prayer
in peace, for behold I depart from you. And making prayer they all cried out, saying, Peace,
peace be with you, brother.</p>
<p>XVII. Then I prayed to the Lord, and there came to me a storm of wind, and received
me upon its wings, and carried me to the place where it found me sitting, and left me there
in peace. And raising its voice the wind said to me, Blessed art thou, Zosimus, that thou
hast been numbered with the blessed. And the beast from the desert, whose name is the
camel, came and received me upon its neck and carried me eighty and five stations, and set
me in the place where it found me praying, and left me in peace, crying and saying, Blessed
art thou, Zosimus, that thou hast been numbered with the blessed.</p>
<p>XVIII. But seeing me thus praised, Satan desired to tempt me and throw his dart at me
from his station, but an angel of God came and said to me, Zosimus, behold Satan is coming
to tempt thee, but the Lord will fight for thee, for the glory of thy faith must bind3996 Satan.
And an angel of God appeared, crying and saying, Welcome, blessed one of Christ. Come
and I shall lead thee to the cave that is the dwelling-place of thy body, for thy cave shall be
a testimony of the desert, a healing of the sick that come to it, a place of trial and touchstone
of demons. And laying hold of my hand he strengthened me, and led me for forty
days to the cave where I had dwelt. And there was there a table of righteousness, and I spent
the night with the angels of God. And I placed the tablets that were given me by the holy
blessed ones on the step of the altar in my cave.</p>
<p>XIX. And, behold, when the angels of God ascended, the Devil came, having a fierce
shape, and possessed with anger and gall, and said to me, I knew that God would do with
thee as with the blessed ones, and that they shall be free from sin and be above the angels,
and therefore I brought in an evil design, and entered into the vessel of the serpent, an evildoer
added to evil-doer. And by this I made the first man Adam to transgress and taste of
the tree of life, since God had commanded him not to eat of it, that he might remain equal
in glory to God and the holy angels; and thou again hast gone and brought this commandment,
but now that they may not be without sin, I shall show thee how I shall destroy thee
and all those that receive this commandment, so that they may not be without sin, and the
book that thou hast brought.</p>
<p>XX. Saying these things the Devil departed from me, and after eight days he brought
with him one thousand three hundred and sixty demons, and dragged me from the cave as
<note type="footnote">3996 Text corrupt; “bind” is conjectural.</note>

The Narrative of Zosimus Concerning the Life of the Blessed.
I prayed, and they beat me, tossing me about between them, for forty days. And after the
forty days the devil lamented before me and said, Woe is me that through one man I have
lost the world, for he has vanquished me by his prayer. And he began to run from me, but
I laying hold of him stayed him and said, Thou shalt not run away and flee from me until
thou swearest to me never again to tempt man. And lamenting with great and violent
lamentation he swore to me by the firmament of heaven, So long as thy dwelling is here,
and after thee, I will not come upon this place. Then I let him go, sending him and the
demons with him into eternal fire. Then the angel came, who had companied with me at
the table, and led me into my cave with great glory.</p>
<p>XXI. After this I lived thirty-six years, and communicated the way of life of the blessed
to the fathers in the desert. But the Devil wept because of the tables of the life of the blessed,
saying, If this get abroad in the world, I shall be mocked, and these will remain without sin
and I alone in folly. And after the completion of the thirty-six years, the angels of God came
to me as to the blessed.
And all the monks were gathered together and all who heard it, and this testament was
read to all of them, and in such life he gave up his soul to God.</p>
<p>XXII. And I, Cryseos,3997 being one of those in the desert, spread it abroad and gave
it to all that were willing to learn it and profit by it. Therefore the angels of God helped to
bury the body of Zosimus as a precious gift, and we saw the soul of the blessed one shining
seven times brighter than the sun. And straightway upon that place there came up seven
palm-trees and overshadowed the cave. There came up also a fountain of water in that
place, holy water, and unto this day a healing and salvation to all the sick that come to it.
Peace be to all that have heard the memorial of the holy Zosimus; the Lord is the advocate
and helper of all to the endless ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<head>THE EPISTLES OF CLEMENT.</head>
<p>Reprinted from the translation given in the 1st vol. of the Ante-Nicene

publication of that volume.</p>

<pb n="404"/>
<head>Introductory Notice to 1st Clement.</head>
<p><del>From Vol. I. of the Ante-Nicene Fathers.</del></p>
<p>The first Epistle, bearing the name of Clement, has been preserved to us in a single
manuscript only. Though very frequently referred to by ancient Christian writers, it remained
unknown to the scholars of Western Europe until happily discovered in the Alexandrian
manuscript. This ms. of the sacred Scriptures (known and generally referred to as Codex
A) was presented in 1628 by Cyril, Patriarch of Constantinople, to Charles I., and is now
preserved in the British Museum. Subjoined to the books of the New Testament contained
in it, there are two writings described as the Epistles of one Clement. Of these, that now
before us is the first. It is tolerably perfect, but there are many slight lacunæ, or gaps, in the
ms., and one whole leaf is supposed to have been lost towards the close. These lacunæ,
however, so numerous in some chapters, do not generally extend beyond a word or syllable,
and can for the most part be easily supplied.</p>
<p>Who the Clement was to whom these writings are ascribed, cannot with absolute certainty
be determined. The general opinion is, that he is the same as the person of that name
referred to by St. Paul (Phil. iv. 3). The writings themselves contain no statement as to their
author. The first, and by far the longer of them, simply purports to have been written in
the name of the church at Rome to the church at Corinth. But in the catalogue of contents
prefixed to the ms. they are both plainly attributed to one Clement; and the judgment of
most scholars is, that, in regard to the first epistle at least, this statement is correct, and that
it is to be regarded as an authentic production of the friend and fellow worker of St. Paul.
This belief may be traced to an early period in the history of the church. It is found in the
writings of Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 15), of Origen (Comm. in Joan., i. 29), and others. The
internal evidence also tends to support this opinion. The doctrine, style, and manner of
thought are all in accordance with it; so that, although, as has been said, positive certainty
cannot be reached on the subject, we may with great probability conclude that we have in
this epistle a composition of that Clement who is known to us from Scripture as having
been an associate of the great apostle.</p>
<p>The date of this epistle has been the subject of considerable controversy. It is clear from
the writing itself that it was composed soon after some persecution (chap. i.) which the
Roman church had endured; and the only question is, whether we are to fix upon the persecution
under Nero or Domitian. If the former, the date will be about the year 68; if the latter,
we must place it towards the close of the first century or the beginning of the second. We
possess no external aid to the settlement of this question. The lists of early Roman bishops
are in hopeless confusion, some making Clement the immediate successor of St. Peter,

<pb n="405"/>
others placing Linus, and others still Linus and Anacletus, between him and the apostle.
The internal evidence, again, leaves the matter doubtful, though it has been strongly pressed
on both sides. The probability seems, on the whole, to be in favour of the Domitian period,
so that the epistle may be dated about a.d. 97.</p>
<p>This epistle was held in very great esteem by the early church. The account given of it
by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 16) is as follows: “There is one acknowledged epistle of this
Clement (whom he has just identified with the friend of St. Paul), great and admirable,
which he wrote in the name of the church of Rome to the church at Corinth, sedition having
then arisen in the latter church. We are aware that this epistle has been publicly read in
very many churches, both in old times and also in our own day.” The epistle before us thus
appears to have been read in numerous churches, as being almost on a level with the canonical
writings. And its place in the Alexandrian ms., immediately after the inspired books,
is in harmony with the position thus assigned it in the primitive church. There does indeed
appear a great difference between it and the inspired writings in many respects, such as the
fanciful use sometimes made of Old Testament statements, the fabulous stories which are
accepted by its author, and the general diffuseness and feebleness of style by which it is
distinguished. But the high tone of evangelical truth which pervades it, the simple and
earnest appeals which it makes to the heart and conscience, and the anxiety which its writer
so constantly shows to promote the best interests of the church of Christ, still impart an
undying charm to this precious relic of later apostolic times.</p>

<head>Additional Introduction.</head>
<p>Towards the close of 1875, at Constantinople, Philotheus Bryennius, Metropolitan of
Serræ, published the first complete edition of the epistles ascribed to Clement. This he was
enabled to do by the discovery of a ms. in the library of the Holy Sepulchre at Fanari in
Constantinople. This ms., of vellum, consists of one hundred and twenty leaves in small
octavo, nearly seven and a half inches in length and six in breadth. The ms. bears the date
1056, and was written by one Leo. Its contents are:</p>
<p>1. Chrysostom’s Synopsis of the Old Testament (the New also being included in the
title).</p>
<p>2. Epistle of Barnabas.</p>
<p>3. Clement to the Corinthians I.</p>
<p>4. Clement to the Corinthians II.</p>
<p>5. Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.</p>
<p>6. Ignatian Epistles.</p>
<p>The ms. is written with comparative accuracy and clearness. Internal evidence seems
to establish its independent value; e.g., words carelessly omitted in the Codex Alexandrinus
are found in this ms. It also supplies the lacunæ, notably chapters 57 (concluding sentence)—
63 inclusive of the first Epistle and chapters 12 (concluding sentences)—20, being
the close of the second Epistle. Harnack seems to prove that the new ms. is as complete as
the original Alexandrian.</p>
<p>The lacuna of the first Epistle consists mainly of a prayer, the writer somewhat abruptly
passing from the oratio obliqua to the oratio recta. The prayer is indicative of intense
earnestness and emotion rather than official authority. It is marked by wealth of quotation,
especially from the Septuagint. Perhaps, too, the nature of the sufferings referred to in the
opening chapters may be inferred from the petitions of this prayer.</p>
<p>In the Notes the old ms. is indicated by A, the recently discovered ms. by I.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—The Salutation. Praise of the Corinthians Before the Breaking Forth of
Schism Among Them.</head>
<p>The church of God which sojourns at Rome, to the church of God sojourning at Corinth,
to them that are called and sanctified by the will of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace unto you, and peace, from Almighty God through Jesus Christ, be multiplied.</p>
<p>Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and successive calamitous events3999 which have
happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been somewhat tardy in turning our attention
to the points respecting which you consulted us; and especially to that shameful and detestable
sedition, utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, which a few rash and self-confident persons
have kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that your venerable and illustrious name, worthy to
be universally loved, has suffered grievous injury.4000 For who ever dwelt even for a short
time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of virtue as it was firmly established?
4001 Who did not admire the sobriety and moderation of your godliness in Christ?
Who did not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual hospitality? And who did not rejoice
over your perfect and well-grounded knowledge? For ye did all things without respect of
persons, and walked in the commandments of God, being obedient to those who had the
rule over you, and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you. Ye enjoined young
men to be of a sober and serious mind, ye instructed your wives to do all things with a
blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands as in duty bound; and ye
taught them that, living in the rule of obedience, they should manage their household affairs
becomingly, and be in every respect marked by discretion.</p>

<p>Moreover, ye were all distinguished by humility, and were in no respect puffed up with
pride, but yielded obedience rather than extorted it,4002 and were more willing to give than
to receive.4003 Content with the provision which God4004 had made for you, and carefully
attending to His words, ye were inwardly filled4005 with His doctrine, and His sufferings
were before your eyes. Thus a profound and abundant peace was given to you all, and ye
had an insatiable desire for doing good, while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was upon
you all. Full of holy designs, ye did, with true earnestness of mind and a godly confidence,
stretch forth your hands to God Almighty, beseeching Him to be merciful unto you, if ye
had been guilty of any involuntary transgression. Day and night ye were anxious for the
whole brotherhood,4006 that the number of God’s elect might be saved with mercy4007 and
a good conscience.4008 Ye were sincere and uncorrupted, and forgetful of injuries between
one another. Every kind of faction and schism was abominable in your sight. Ye mourned
over the transgressions of your neighbours: their deficiencies you deemed your own. Ye
never grudged any act of kindness, being “ready to every good work.”4009 Adorned by a
thoroughly virtuous and religious life, ye did all things in the fear of God. The commandments
and ordinances of the Lord were written upon the tablets of your hearts.4010</p>

<p>Every kind of honour and happiness4011 was bestowed upon you, and then was fulfilled
that which is written, “My beloved did eat and drink, and was enlarged and became fat, and
kicked.”4012 Hence flowed emulation and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and disorder,
war and captivity. So the worthless rose up against the honoured, those of no reputation
against such as were renowned, the foolish against the wise, the young against those advanced
in years. For this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you, inasmuch
as every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith,4013 neither walks
in the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian,4014 but walks
after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by

<p>For thus it is written: “And it came to pass after certain days, that Cain brought of the
fruits of the earth a sacrifice unto God; and Abel also brought of the firstlings of his sheep,
and of the fat thereof. And God had respect to Abel and to his offerings, but Cain and his
sacrifices He did not regard. And Cain was deeply grieved, and his countenance fell. And
God said to Cain, Why art thou grieved, and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou offerest
rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at peace: thine offering returns
to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it. And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into
the field. And it came to pass, while they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
his brother, and slew him.”4016 Ye see, brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the murder
of a brother. Through envy, also, our father Jacob fled from the face of Esau his brother.4017
Envy made Joseph be persecuted unto death, and to come into bondage.4018 Envy compelled
Moses to flee from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words from his
fellow-countryman, “Who made thee a judge or a ruler over us? Wilt thou kill me, as thou
didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?”4019 On account of envy, Aaron and Miriam had to make
their abode without the camp.4020 Envy brought down Dathan and Abiram alive to Hades,
through the sedition which they excited against God’s servant Moses.4021 Through envy,
David not only underwent the hatred of foreigners, but was also persecuted by Saul king of
Israel.4022</p>

<p>But not to dwell upon ancient examples, let us come to the most recent spiritual heroes.
4023 Let us take the noble examples furnished in our own generation. Through envy4024
and jealousy the greatest and most righteous pillars [of the church] have been persecuted
and put to death.4025 Let us set before our eyes the illustrious4026 apostles. Peter, through
unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but numerous labours; and when he had at
length suffered martyrdom, departed to the place of glory due to him. Owing to envy, Paul
also obtained4027 the reward of patient endurance, after being seven times thrown into
captivity,4028 compelled4029 to flee, and stoned. After preaching both in the east and west,
he gained the illustrious reputation due to his faith, having taught righteousness4030 to the
whole world, and come to the extreme limit of the west,4031 and suffered martyrdom under
the prefects.4032 Thus was he removed from the world, and went into the holy place, having
proved himself a striking example of patience.</p>

<p>To these men who spent their lives in the practice of holiness, there is to be added a

furnished us with a most excellent example. Through envy, those women, the Danaids4033
and Dircæ, being persecuted, after they had suffered terrible and unspeakable torments,
finished the course of their faith with stedfastness,4034 and though weak in body, received
a noble reward. Envy has alienated wives from their husbands, and changed that saying of

our salvation, has set the grace of repentance before the whole world.4039 Let us turn to4040
every age that has passed, and learn that, from generation to generation, the Lord has
granted a place of repentance to all such as would be converted unto Him. Noah preached
repentance, and as many as listened to him were saved.4041 Jonah proclaimed destruction
to the Ninevites;4042 but they, repenting of their sins, propitiated God by prayer, and obtained
salvation, although they were aliens [to the covenant] of God.</p>

<p>The ministers of the grace of God have, by the Holy Spirit, spoken of repentance; and
the Lord of all things has himself declared with an oath regarding it, “As I live, saith the
Lord, I desire not the death of the sinner, but rather his repentance;”4043 adding, moreover,
this gracious declaration, “Repent, O house of Israel, of your iniquity.”4044 Say to the children
of my people, Though your sins reach from earth to heaven, and though they be redder4045
than scarlet, and blacker than sack-cloth, yet if ye turn to me with your whole heart, and
say, Father! I will listen to you, as to a holy4046 people. And in another place He speaks
thus: “Wash you and become clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before
mine eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out judgment, deliver the
oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that justice is done to the widow; and come, and let
us reason together. He declares, Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white
as snow; though they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if ye be willing and
obey me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse, and will not hearken unto me,
the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things.”4047 Desiring,
therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He has, by His

Enoch, who, being found righteous in obedience, was translated, and death was

<p>Abraham, styled “the friend,”4050 was found faithful, inasmuch as he rendered obedience
to the words of God. He, in the exercise of obedience, went out from his own country, and
from his kindred, and from his father’s house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory,
and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the promises of God. For
God said to him, “Get thee out from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father’s house, into the land which I shall show thee. And I will make thee a great nation,
and will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be blessed. And I will bless
them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee shall all the families of the
earth be blessed.”4051 And again, on his departing from Lot, God said to him, “Lift up thine
eyes, and look from the place where thou now art, northward, and southward, and eastward,
and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for
ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, [so that] if a man can number the
dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.”4052 And again [the Scripture] saith,
“God brought forth Abram, and spake unto him, Look up now to heaven, and count the
stars if thou be able to number them; so shall thy seed be. And Abram believed God, and
it was counted to him for righteousness.”4053 On account of his faith and hospitality, a son
was given him in his old age; and in the exercise of obedience, he offered him as a sacrifice
to God on one of the mountains which He showed him.4054</p>

country round was punished by means of fire and brimstone, the Lord thus making it
manifest that He does not forsake those that hope in Him, but gives up such as depart from
Him to punishment and torture.4055 For Lot’s wife, who went forth with him, being of a
different mind from himself, and not continuing in agreement with him [as to the command
which had been given them], was made an example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this
day.4056 This was done that all might know that those who are of a double mind, and who

<p>On account of her faith and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved. For when spies
were sent by Joshua, the son of Nun, to Jericho, the king of the country ascertained that
they were come to spy out their land, and sent men to seize them, in order that, when taken,
they might be put to death. But the hospitable Rahab receiving them, concealed them on
the roof of her house under some stalks of flax. And when the men sent by the king arrived
and said, “There came men unto thee who are to spy out our land; bring them forth, for so
the king commands,” she answered them, “The two men whom ye seek came unto me, but
quickly departed again and are gone,” thus not discovering the spies to them. Then she said
to the men, “I know assuredly that the Lord your God hath given you this city, for the fear
and dread of you have fallen on its inhabitants. When therefore ye shall have taken it, keep
ye me and the house of my father in safety.” And they said to her, “It shall be as thou hast
spoken to us. As soon, therefore, as thou knowest that we are at hand, thou shalt gather all
thy family under thy roof, and they shall be preserved, but all that are found outside of thy
dwelling shall perish.”4058 Moreover, they gave her a sign to this effect, that she should
hang forth from her house a scarlet thread. And thus they made it manifest that redemption
should flow through the blood of the Lord to all them that believe and hope in God.4059

glory in his might, neither let the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory
in the Lord, in diligently seeking Him, and doing judgment and righteousness”4060), being
especially mindful of the words of the Lord Jesus which He spake teaching us meekness and
long-suffering. For thus He spoke: “Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive, that
it may be forgiven to you; as ye do, so shall it be done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be
judged; as ye are kind, so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete, with
the same it shall be measured to you.”4061 By this precept and by these rules let us stablish
ourselves, that we walk with all humility in obedience to His holy words. For the holy word
saith, “On whom shall I look, but on him that is meek and peaceable, and that trembleth at

we shall incur no slight injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the
inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults,4063 so as to draw us away from
what is good. Let us be kind one to another after the pattern of the tender mercy and benignity
of our Creator. For it is written, “The kind-hearted shall inhabit the land, and the
guiltless shall be left upon it, but transgressors shall be destroyed from off the face of it.”4064
And again [the Scripture] saith, “I saw the ungodly highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars
of Lebanon: I passed by, and, behold, he was not; and I diligently sought his place, and
could not find it. Preserve innocence, and look on equity: for there shall be a remnant to

<head>Chapter XVI.—Christ as an Example of Humility.</head>
<p>For Christ is of those who are humble-minded, and not of those who exalt themselves
over His flock. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come in
the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition,
as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. For He says, “Lord, who hath believed our
report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have declared [our message] in
His presence: He is, as it were, a child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form
nor glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was without
eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form of men. He is a man exposed
to stripes and suffering, and acquainted with the endurance of grief: for His countenance
was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our iniquities, and is in
sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that [on His own account] He was exposed to labour,
and stripes, and affliction. But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our
iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed.
All we, like sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord
has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings openeth not His

<p>Let us be imitators also of those who in goat-skins and sheep-skins4079 went about
proclaiming the coming of Christ; I mean Elijah, Elisha, and Ezekiel among the prophets,
with those others to whom a like testimony is borne <del>in Scripture</del>. Abraham was specially
honoured, and was called the friend of God; yet he, earnestly regarding the glory of God,
humbly declared, “I am but dust and ashes.”4080 Moreover, it is thus written of Job, “Job
was a righteous man, and blameless, truthful, God-fearing, and one that kept himself from
all evil.”4081 But bringing an accusation against himself, he said, “No man is free from defilement,
even if his life be but of one day.”4082 Moses was called faithful in all God’s
house;4083 and through his instrumentality,4084 God punished Egypt with plagues and tortures.
Yet he, though thus greatly honoured, did not adopt lofty language, but said, when
the divine oracle came to him out of the bush, “Who am I, that Thou sendest me? I am a
man of a feeble voice and a slow tongue.”4085 And again he said, “I am but as the smoke of
a pot.”4086</p>

in everlasting mercy have I anointed him?”4088 Yet this very man saith to God, “Have mercy
on me, O Lord, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions,
blot out my transgression.4089 Wash me still more from mine iniquity, and cleanse
me from my sin. For I acknowledge mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against
Thee only have I sinned, and done that which is evil in Thy sight; that Thou mayest be justified
in Thy sayings, and mayest overcome when Thou4090 art judged. For, behold, I was
conceived in transgressions, and in sins did my mother conceive me. For, behold, Thou
hast loved truth; the secret and hidden things of wisdom hast Thou shown me. Thou shalt
sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter
than snow. Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; my bones, which have been
humbled, shall exult. Turn away Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.4091 Cast me not
away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of
Thy salvation, and establish me by Thy governing Spirit. I will teach transgressors Thy
ways, and the ungodly shall be converted unto Thee. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness,4092
O God, the God of my salvation: my tongue shall exult in Thy righteousness. O Lord, Thou
shalt open my mouth, and my lips shall show forth Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired
sacrifice, I would have given it; Thou wilt not delight in burnt-offerings. The sacrifice <del>acceptable</del>
to God is a bruised spirit; a broken and a contrite heart God will not despise.”4093</p>

<p>Thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men have rendered

set before us;4094 and let us look stedfastly to the Father and Creator of the universe, and

<head>Chapter XX.—The Peace and Harmony of the Universe.</head>
<p>The heavens, revolving under His government, are subject to Him in peace. Day and
night run the course appointed by Him, in no wise hindering each other. The sun and
moon, with the companies of the stars, roll on in harmony according to His command,
within their prescribed limits, and without any deviation. The fruitful earth, according to
His will, brings forth food in abundance, at the proper seasons, for man and beast and all
the living beings upon it, never hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He
has fixed. The unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements of the
lower world, are restrained by the same laws. The vast unmeasurable sea, gathered together
by His working into various basins,4095 never passes beyond the bounds placed around it,
but does as He has commanded. For He said, “Thus far shalt thou come, and thy waves
shall be broken within thee.”4096 The ocean, impassable to man and the worlds beyond it,
are regulated by the same enactments of the Lord. The seasons of spring, summer, autumn,
and winter, peacefully give place4097 to one another. The winds in their several quarters4098
fulfil, at the proper time, their service without hindrance. The ever-flowing fountains,
formed both for enjoyment and health, furnish without fail their breasts for the life of men.
The very smallest of living beings meet together in peace and concord. All these the great
Creator and Lord of all has appointed to exist in peace and harmony; while He does good
to all, but most abundantly to us who have fled for refuge to His compassions through Jesus
Christ our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us all. <del>For

Spirit of the Lord is a candle searching the secret parts of the belly.”4099 Let us reflect how
near He is, and that none of the thoughts or reasonings in which we engage are hid from
Him. It is right, therefore, that we should not leave the post which His will has assigned us.
Let us rather offend those men who are foolish, and inconsiderate, and lifted up, and who
glory in the pride of their speech, than <del>offend</del> God. Let us reverence the Lord Jesus
Christ,4100 whose blood was given for us; let us esteem those who have the rule over us;4101
let us honour the aged4102 among us; let us train up the young men in the fear of God; let

let them display their love, not by preferring4104 one to another, but by showing equal affection
to all that piously fear God. Let your children be partakers of true Christian training;
let them learn of how great avail humility is with God—how much the spirit of pure affection
can prevail with Him—how excellent and great His fear is, and how it saves all those who
walk in4105 it with a pure mind. For He is a Searcher of the thoughts and desires <del>of the

called a phoenix. This is the only one of its kind, and lives five hundred years. And when
the time of its dissolution draws near that it must die, it builds itself a nest of frankincense,
and myrrh, and other spices, into which, when the time is fulfilled, it enters and dies. But
as the flesh decays a certain kind of worm is produced, which, being nourished by the juices
of the deed bird, brings forth feathers. Then, when it has acquired strength, it takes up that
nest in which are the bones of its parent, and bearing these it passes4120 from the land of
Arabia into Egypt, to the city called Heliopolis. And, in open day, flying4121 in the sight of
all men, it places them on the altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its
former abode. The priests then inspect the registers of the dates, and find that it has returned

of Judah. Nor are his other tribes in small glory,4158 inasmuch as God had promised, “Thy
seed shall be as the stars of heaven.”4159 All these, therefore, were highly honoured, and
made great, not for their own sake, or for their own works, or for the righteousness which
they wrought, but through the operation of His will. And we, too, being called by His will4160
in Christ Jesus, are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding,
or godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by that faith through
which, from the beginning, Almighty God has justified all men; to whom be glory for ever

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—But Let Us Not Give Up the Practice of Good Works and Love.</head>
<p>God Himself is an Example to Us of Good Works.
What shall we do,4161 then, brethren? Shall we become slothful in well-doing, and cease
from the practice of love? God forbid that any such course should be followed by us! But
rather let us hasten with all energy and readiness of mind to perform every good work. For
the Creator and Lord of all Himself rejoices in His works. For by His infinitely great power
He established the heavens, and by His incomprehensible wisdom He adorned them. He
also divided the earth from the water which surrounds it, and fixed it upon the immovable
foundation of His own will. The animals also which are upon it He commanded by His
own word4162 into existence. So likewise, when He had formed4163 the sea, and the living
creatures which are in it, He enclosed them <del>within their proper bounds</del> by His own power.
Above all,4164 with His holy and undefiled hands He formed man, the most excellent <del>of
His creatures</del>, and truly great through the understanding given him—the express likeness
of His own image. For thus says God: “Let us make man in our image, and after our likeness.
So God made man; male and female He created them.”4165 Having thus finished all these
things, He approved them, and blessed them, and said, “Increase and multiply.”4166 We
see,4167 then, how all righteous men have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord
Himself, adorning Himself with His works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an example,
let us without delay accede to His will, and let us work the work of righteousness with our
whole strength.</p>

<p>The good servant4168 receives the bread of his labour with confidence; the lazy and
slothful cannot look his employer in the face. It is requisite, therefore, that we be prompt
in the practice of well-doing; for of Him are all things. And thus He forewarns us: “Behold,
the Lord <del>cometh</del>, and His reward is before His face, to render to every man according to
his work.”4169 He exhorts us, therefore,4170 with our whole heart to attend to this,4171 that
we be not lazy or slothful in any good work. Let our boasting and our confidence be in
Him. Let us submit ourselves to His will. Let us consider the whole multitude of His angels,
how they stand ever ready to minister to His will. For the Scripture saith, “Ten thousand
times ten thousand stood around Him, and thousands of thousands ministered unto Him,4172
and cried, Holy, holy, holy, <del>is</del> the Lord of Sabaoth; the whole creation4173 is full of His
glory.”4174 And let us therefore, conscientiously gathering together in harmony, cry to Him
earnestly, as with one mouth, that we may be made partakers of His great and glorious
promises. For <del>the Scripture</del> saith, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of man, the things which He hath prepared for them that wait for4175 Him.”4176</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—Immense is This Reward. How Shall We Obtain It?</head>
<p>How blessed and wonderful, beloved, are the gifts of God! Life in immortality, splendour
in righteousness, truth in perfect confidence,4177 faith in assurance, self-control in holiness!
And all these fall under the cognizance of our understandings <del>now</del>; what then shall those
things be which are prepared for such as wait for Him? The Creator and Father of all
worlds,4178 the Most Holy,4179 alone knows their amount and their beauty. Let us therefore
earnestly strive to be found in the number of those that wait for Him, in order that we may
share in His promised gifts. But how, beloved, shall this be done? If our understanding be
fixed by faith towards God; if we earnestly seek the things4180 which are pleasing and acceptable
to Him; if we do the things which are in harmony with His blameless will; and if we
follow the way of truth, casting away from us all unrighteousness and iniquity,4181 along
with all covetousness,4182 strife, evil practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking, all
hatred of God, pride and haughtiness, vain glory and ambition.4183 For they that do such
things are hateful to God; and not only they that do them, but also those that take pleasure
in them that do them.4184 For the Scripture saith, “But to the sinner God said, Wherefore
dost thou declare my statutes, and take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction,
and castest my words behind thee? When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst
with4185 him, and didst make thy portion with adulterers. Thy mouth has abounded with
wickedness, and thy tongue contrived4186 deceit. Thou sittest, and speakest against thy
brother; thou slanderest4187 thine own mother’s son. These things thou hast done, and I
kept silence; thou thoughtest, wicked one, that I should be like to thyself. But I will reprove
thee, and set thyself before thee. Consider now these things, ye that forget God, lest He tear
you in pieces, like a lion, and there be none to deliver.4188 The sacrifice of praise will glorify

a man be pure before the Lord? Or shall such an one be <del>counted</del> blameless in his deeds,
seeing He does not confide in His servants, and has charged4213 even His angels with perversity?
The heaven is not clean in His sight: how much less they that dwell in houses of
clay, of which also we ourselves were made! He smote them as a moth; and from morning
even until evening they endure not. Because they could furnish no assistance to themselves,
they perished. He breathed upon them, and they died, because they had no wisdom. But
call now, if any one will answer thee, or if thou wilt look to any of the holy angels; for wrath
destroys the foolish man, and envy killeth him that is in error. I have seen the foolish taking

appointed times and hours. Where and by whom He desires these things to be done, He
Himself has fixed by His own supreme will, in order that all things, being piously done according
to His good pleasure, may be acceptable unto Him.4217 Those, therefore, who
present their offerings at the appointed times, are accepted and blessed; for inasmuch as
they follow the laws of the Lord, they sin not. For his own peculiar services are assigned to

given him, and when the other prophets also followed him, bearing witness with one consent
to the ordinances which he had appointed? For, when rivalry arose concerning the priesthood,
and the tribes were contending among themselves as to which of them should be adorned
with that glorious title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring him
their rods, each one being inscribed with the name4230 of the tribe. And he took them and
bound them <del>together</del>, and sealed them with the rings of the princes of the tribes, and laid
them up in the tabernacle of witness on the table of God. And having shut the doors of the
tabernacle, he sealed the keys, as he had done the rods, and said to them, Men and brethren,
the tribe whose rod shall blossom has God chosen to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and
to minister unto Him. And when the morning was come, he assembled all Israel, six hundred
thousand men, and showed the seals to the princes of the tribes, and opened the tabernacle
of witness, and brought forth the rods. And the rod of Aaron was found not only to have
blossomed, but to bear fruit upon it.4231 What think ye, beloved? Did not Moses know

<p>Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that there would be strife on
account of the office4232 of the episcopate. For this reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had
obtained a perfect fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those <del>ministers</del> already mentioned,
and afterwards gave instructions,4233 that when these should fall asleep, other approved
men should succeed them in their ministry. We are of opinion, therefore, that those
appointed by them,4234 or afterwards by other eminent men, with the consent of the whole
church, and who have blamelessly served the flock of Christ, in a humble, peaceable, and
disinterested spirit, and have for a long time possessed the good opinion of all, cannot be
justly dismissed from the ministry. For our sin will not be small, if we eject from the episcopate4235
those who have blamelessly and holily fulfilled its duties.4236 Blessed are those
presbyters who, having finished their course before now, have obtained a fruitful and perfect
departure <del>from this world</del>; for they have no fear lest any one deprive them of the place
now appointed them. But we see that ye have removed some men of excellent behaviour

Spirit. Observe4237 that nothing of an unjust or counterfeit character is written in them.
There4238 you will not find that the righteous were cast off by men who themselves were
holy. The righteous were indeed persecuted, but only by the wicked. They were cast into
prison, but only by the unholy; they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain,
but only by the accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy against them.
Exposed to such sufferings, they endured them gloriously. For what shall we say, brethren?
Was Daniel4239 cast into the den of lions by such as feared God? Were Ananias, and Azarias,
and Michael shut up in a furnace4240 of fire by those who observed4241 the great and glorious
worship of the Most High? Far from us be such a thought! Who, then, were they that did

a pure conscience venerate4242 His all-excellent name; to whom be glory for ever and ever.

holy.”4245 And again, in another place, <del>the Scripture</del> saith, “With a harmless man thou
shalt prove4246 thyself harmless, and with an elect man thou shalt be elect, and with a perverse
man thou shalt show4247 thyself perverse.”4248 Let us cleave, therefore, to the innocent and
righteous, since these are the elect of God. Why are there strifes, and tumults, and divisions,
and schisms, and wars4249 among you? Have we not <del>all</del> one God and one Christ? Is there
not one Spirit of grace poured out upon us? And have we not one calling in Christ?4250
Why do we divide and tear in pieces the members of Christ, and raise up strife against our
own body, and have reached such a height of madness as to forget that “we are members
one of another?”4251 Remember the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, how4252 He said, “Woe
to that man <del>by whom4253 offences come</del>! It were better for him that he had never been
born, than that he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my elect. Yea, it were better
for him that a millstone should be hung about <del>his neck</del>, and he should be sunk in the
depths of the sea, than that he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my little ones.”4254
Your schism has subverted <del>the faith of</del> many, has discouraged many, has given rise to
doubt in many, and has caused grief to us all. And still your sedition continueth.</p>

<p>Take up the epistle of the blessed Apostle Paul. What did he write to you at the time
when the gospel first began to be preached?4255 Truly, under the inspiration4256 of the
Spirit, he wrote to you concerning himself, and Cephas, and Apollos,4257 because even then
parties4258 had been formed among you. But that inclination for one above another entailed
less guilt upon you, inasmuch as your partialities were then shown towards apostles, already
of high reputation, and towards a man whom they had approved. But now reflect who those
are that have perverted you, and lessened the renown of your far-famed brotherly love. It
is disgraceful, beloved, yea, highly disgraceful, and unworthy of your Christian profession,4259
that such a thing should be heard of as that the most stedfast and ancient church of the
Corinthians should, on account of one or two persons, engage in sedition against its presbyters.
And this rumour has reached not only us, but those also who are unconnected4260
with us; so that, through your infatuation, the name of the Lord is blasphemed, while danger
is also brought upon yourselves.</p>

to us, and restore us to our former seemly and holy practice of brotherly love. For
<del>such conduct</del> is the gate of righteousness, which is set open for the attainment of life, as
it is written, “Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise
the Lord: this is the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter in by it.”4263 Although,
therefore, many gates have been set open, yet this gate of righteousness is that gate in Christ
by which blessed are all they that have entered in and have directed their way in holiness
and righteousness, doing all things without disorder. Let a man be faithful: let him be
powerful in the utterance of knowledge; let him be wise in judging of words; let him be pure
in all his deeds; yet the more he seems to be superior to others <del>in these respects</del>, the more
humble-minded ought he to be, and to seek the common good of all, and not merely his

<p>Let him who has love in Christ keep the commandments of Christ. Who can describe
the <del>blessed</del> bond of the love of God? What man is able to tell the excellence of its beauty,
as it ought to be told? The height to which love exalts is unspeakable. Love unites us to
God. Love covers a multitude of sins.4264 Love beareth all things, is long-suffering in all
things.4265 There is nothing base, nothing arrogant in love. Love admits of no schisms:
love gives rise to no seditions: love does all things in harmony. By love have all the elect of
God been made perfect; without love nothing is well-pleasing to God. In love has the Lord
taken us to Himself. On account of the love He bore us, Jesus Christ our Lord gave His
blood for us by the will of God; His flesh for our flesh, and His soul for our souls.</p>

Let us pray,4266 therefore, and implore of His mercy, that we may live4267 blameless in love,
free from all human partialities for one above another. All the generations from Adam even
unto this day have passed away; but those who, through the grace of God, have been made
perfect in love, now possess a place among the godly, and shall be made manifest at the
revelation4268 of the kingdom of Christ.4269 For it is written, “Enter into thy secret chambers
for a little time, until my wrath and fury pass away; and I will remember a propitious4270
day, and will raise you up out of your graves.”4271 Blessed are we, beloved, if we keep the
commandments of God in the harmony of love; that so through love our sins may be forgiven
us. For it is written, “Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins
are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not impute to him, and in whose
mouth there is no guile.4272 This blessedness cometh upon those who have been chosen

of those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses the servant4275 of God, and

<p>Ye understand, beloved, ye understand well the sacred Scriptures, and ye have looked

Moses went up into the mount, and abode there, with fasting and humiliation, forty days
and forty nights, the Lord said unto him, “Moses, Moses, get thee down quickly from hence;
for thy people whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt have committed iniquity.
They have speedily departed from the way in which I commanded them to walk, and have
made to themselves molten images.”4283 And the Lord said unto him, “I have spoken to
thee once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people:
let me destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make thee a
great and wonderful nation, and one much more numerous than this.”4284 But Moses said,
“Far be it from Thee, Lord: pardon the sin of this people; else blot me also out of the book
of the living.”4285 O marvellous4286 love! O insuperable perfection! The servant4287 speaks
freely to his Lord, and asks forgiveness for the people, or begs that he himself might perish4288

<head>Chapter LV.—Examples of Such Love.</head>
<p>To bring forward some examples4293 from among the heathen: Many kings and princes,
in times of pestilence, when they had been instructed by an oracle, have given themselves
up to death, in order that by their own blood they might deliver their fellow-citizens <del>from
destruction</del>. Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be brought
to an end within them. We know many among ourselves who have given themselves up to
bonds, in order that they might ransom others. Many, too, have surrendered themselves
to slavery, that with the price4294 which they received for themselves, they might provide
food for others. Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed
numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the
elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger,
she went out for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and the
Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman.4295 Esther also, being perfect in
faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from
impending destruction. For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the everlasting4296
God, who seeth all things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit, delivered the people
for whose sake she had encountered peril.4297</p>

<head>Chapter LVI.—Let Us Admonish and Correct One Another.</head>
<p>Let us then also pray for those who have fallen into any sin, that meekness and humil
ity may be given to them, so that they may submit, not unto us, but to the will of God. For
in this way they shall secure a fruitful and perfect remembrance from us, with sympathy for
them, both in our prayers to God, and our mention of them to the saints.4298 Let us receive
correction, beloved, on account of which no one should feel displeased. Those exhortations
by which we admonish one another are both good <del>in themselves</del>, and highly profitable,
for they tend to unite4299 us to the will of God. For thus saith the holy Word: “The Lord
hath severely chastened me, yet hath not given me over to death.”4300 “For whom the Lord
loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth.”4301 “The righteous,”4302
saith it, “shall chasten me in mercy, and reprove me; but let not the oil of sinners make fat
my head.”4303 And again he saith, “Blessed is the man whom the Lord reproveth, and reject
not thou the warning of the Almighty. For He causes sorrow, and again restores <del>to gladness</del>;
He woundeth, and His hands make whole. He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in the
seventh no evil shall touch thee. In famine He shall rescue thee from death, and in war He
shall free thee from the power4304 of the sword. From the scourge of the tongue will He
hide thee, and thou shalt not fear when evil cometh. Thou shalt laugh at the unrighteous
and the wicked, and shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the field. For the wild beasts shall
be at peace with thee: then shalt thou know that thy house shall be in peace, and the habitation
of thy tabernacle shall not fail.4305 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,
and thy children like the grass of the field. And thou shalt come to the grave like ripened
corn which is reaped in its season, or like a heap of the threshing-floor which is gathered
together at the proper time.”4306 Ye see, beloved, that4307 “protection is afforded to those

that ye should occupy4310 a humble but honourable place in the flock of Christ, than that,
being highly exalted, ye should be cast out from the hope of His people.4311 For thus
speaketh all-virtuous Wisdom: “Behold, I will bring forth to you the words of my Spirit,
and I will teach you my speech. Since I called, and ye did not hear; I held forth my words,
and ye regarded not, but set at naught my counsels, and yielded not at my reproofs; therefore
I too will laugh at your destruction; yea, I will rejoice when ruin cometh upon you, and
when sudden confusion overtakes you, when overturning presents itself like a tempest, or
when tribulation and oppression4312 fall upon you. For it shall come to pass, that when ye
call upon me, I will not hear you; the wicked shall seek me, and they shall not find me. For
they hated wisdom, and did not choose the fear of the Lord; nor would they listen to my
counsels, but despised my reproofs. Wherefore they shall eat the fruits of their own way,
and they shall be filled4313 with their own ungodliness.4314…For, in punishment for the
wrongs which they practised upon babes, shall they be slain, and inquiry will be death to
the ungodly; but he that heareth me shall rest in hope and be undisturbed by the fear of any

<head>Chapter LXII.—Summary and Conclusory—Concerning Godliness.</head>
<p>Concerning the things pertaining to our religious observance which are most profitable
for a life of goodness to those who would pursue a godly and righteous course, we have
written to you, men and brethren, at sufficient length. For concerning faith and repentance
and true love and continence and soberness and patience, we have touched upon every
passage, putting you in mind that you ought in righteousness and truth and long-suffering
to be well-pleasing4324 to Almighty God with holiness, being of one mind—not remembering
evil—in love and peace with instant gentleness, even as also our fathers forementioned found
favour by the humility of their thoughts towards the Father and God and Creator and all
mankind. And of these things we put you in mind with the greater pleasure, since we were
well assured that we were writing to men who were faithful and of highest repute and had
peered into the oracles of the instruction of God.</p>

<p>Right is it, therefore, to approach examples so good and so many, and submit the neck
and fulfil the part of obedience, in order that, undisturbed by vain sedition, we may attain
unto the goal set before us in truth wholly free from blame. Joy and gladness will ye afford
us, if ye become obedient to the words written by us and through the Holy Spirit root out
the lawless wrath of your jealousy according to the intercession which we have made for
peace and unity in this letter. We have sent men faithful and discreet, whose conversation
from youth to old age has been blameless amongst us,—the same shall be witnesses between
you and us. This we have done, that ye may know that our whole concern has been and is

<head>Introductory Notice.</head>
<p><del>From Vol. VII., p. 515 of the Ante-Nicene Fathers.</del></p>
<p>The first certain reference which is made by any early writer to this so-called Epistle of
Clement is found in these words of Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 38): “We must know that there
is also a second Epistle of Clement. But we do not regard it as being equally notable with
the former, since we know of none of the ancients that have made use of it.” Several critics
in modern times have endeavoured to vindicate the authenticity of this epistle. But it is
now generally regarded. as one of the many writings which have been falsely ascribed to
Clement. Besides the want of external evidence, indicated even by Eusebius in the above
extract, the diversity of style clearly points to a different writer from that of the first epistle.
A commonly accepted opinion among critics at the present day is, that this is not an epistle
at all, but a fragment of one of the many homilies falsely ascribed to Clement. There can
be no doubt, however, that in the catalogue of writings contained in the Alexandrian ms. it
is both styled an epistle, and, as well as the other which accompanies it, is attributed to
Clement. As the ms. is certainly not later than the fifth century, the opinion referred to
must by that time have taken firm root in the Church; but in the face of internal evidence,
and in want of all earlier testimony, such a fact goes but a small way to establish its authenticity.</p>
<p>The second epistle differs from the first in several respects. The range of Scriptural
quotation is wider, the quotations of the first epistle being taken mainly from the Septuagint
version of the Old Testament. The attitude of the writer is in accordance with this fact; it
is distinctively Gentile. For example, Chapter XII. contains a report of words purporting
to have been spoken by the Lord; these, Clemens Alexandrinus states, are taken from the
Apocryphal Gospel according to the Egyptians, not now extant. The reference in Chapter
XIV. to the spiritual church, recalling Eph. i. 3–5, is parallel to the Pastor of Hermas, Vision
II. 4. These passages help to determine the date; for the quotation from the Apocryphal
Gospel would not have been made after the four gospels of the New Testament obtained
exclusive authority—toward the close of the second century; while similarity of idea and
exposition would seem to make the second epistle and the Pastor of Hermas somewhat
contemporaneous.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the second epistle, as in the recently discovered ms., goes to establish
the speculation made before this ms. was discovered, that it is a homily to be read in churches.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.—We Ought to Think Highly of Christ.</head>
<p>Brethren, it is fitting that you should think of Jesus Christ as of God,—as the Judge of
the living and the dead. And it does not become us to think lightly of our salvation; for if
we think little of Him, we shall also hope but to obtain little <del>from Him</del>. And those of us
who hear carelessly of these things, as if they were of small importance, commit sin, not
knowing whence we have been called, and by whom, and to what place, and how much Jesus
Christ submitted to suffer for our sakes. What return, then, shall we make to Him, or what
fruit that shall be worthy of that which He has given to us? For, indeed, how great are the
benefits4329 which we owe to Him! He has graciously given us light; as a Father, He has
called us sons; He has saved us when we were ready to perish. What praise, then, shall we
give to Him, or what return shall we make for the things which we have received?4330 We
were deficient4331 in understanding, worshipping stones and wood, and gold, and silver,
and brass, the works of men’s hands;4332 and our whole life was nothing else than death.
Involved in blindness, and with such darkness4333 before our eyes, we have received sight,
and through His will have laid aside that cloud by which we were enveloped. For He had
compassion on us, and mercifully saved us, observing the many errors in which we were
entangled, as well as the destruction to which we were exposed,4334 and that we had no hope
of salvation except it came to us from Him. For He called us when we were not,4335 and
willed that out of nothing we should attain a real existence.4336</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Church, Formerly Barren, is Now Fruitful.</head>
<p>“Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for
she that is desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband.”4337 In that
He said, “Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not,” He referred to us, for our church was barren
before that children were given to her. But when He said, “Cry out, thou that travailest not,”
He means this, that we should sincerely offer up our prayers to God, and should not, like
women in travail, show signs of weakness.4338 And in that He said, “For she that is desolate
hath many more children than she that hath an husband,” <del>He means</del> that our people
seemed to be outcast from God, but now, through believing, have become more numerous
than those who are reckoned to possess God.4339 And another Scripture saith, “I came not
to call the righteous, but sinners.”4340 This means that those who are perishing must be
saved. For it is indeed a great and admirable thing to establish not the things which are
standing, but those that are falling. Thus also did Christ4341 desire to save the things which
were perishing,4342 and has saved many by coming and calling us when hastening to destruction.

<head>III.—The Duty of Confessing Christ.</head>
<p>Since, then, He has displayed so great mercy towards us, and especially in this respect,
that we who are living should not offer sacrifices to gods that are dead, or pay them wor-
ship,4344 but should attain through Him to the knowledge of the true Father,4345 whereby
shall we show that we do indeed know Him,4346 but by not denying Him through whom
this knowledge has been attained? For He himself declares, “Whosoever shall confess me
before men, him will I confess before my Father.”4347 This, then, is our reward if we shall
confess Him by whom we have been saved. But in what way shall we confess Him? By doing
what He says, and not transgressing His commandments, and by honouring Him not with
our lips only, but with all our heart and all our mind.4348 For He says in Isaiah, “This people
honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.”4349</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—True Confession of Christ.</head>
<p>Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He saith, “Not every
one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he that worketh righteousness.”4350
Wherefore, brethren, let us confess Him by our works, by loving one another, by not committing
adultery, or speaking evil of one another, or cherishing envy; but by being continent,
compassionate, and good. We ought also to sympathize with one another, and not be avaricious.
By such works let us confess Him,4351 and not by those that are of an opposite kind.
And it is not fitting that we should fear men, but rather God. For this reason, if we should
do such <del>wicked</del> things, the Lord hath said, “Even though ye were gathered together to4352
me in my very bosom, yet if ye were not to keep my commandments, I would cast you off,
and say unto you, Depart from me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of iniquity.”4353</p>

<head>Chapter V.—This World Should Be Despised.</head>
<p>Wherefore, brethren, leaving <del>willingly</del> our sojourn in this present world, let us do the
will of Him that called us, and not fear to depart out of this world. For the Lord saith, “Ye
shall be as lambs in the midst of wolves.”4354 And Peter answered and said unto Him,4355
“What, then, if the wolves shall tear in pieces the lambs?” Jesus said unto Peter, “The lambs
have no cause after they are dead to fear4356 the wolves; and in like manner, fear not ye
them that kill you, and can do nothing more unto you; but fear Him who, after you are dead,
has power over both soul and body to cast them into hell-fire.”4357 And consider,4358
brethren, that the sojourning in the flesh in this world is but brief and transient, but the
promise of Christ is great and wonderful, even the rest of the kingdom to come, and of life
everlasting.4359 By what course of conduct, then, shall we attain these things, but by leading
a holy and righteous life, and by deeming these worldly things as not belonging to us, and
not fixing our desires upon them? For if we desire to possess them, we fall away from the
path of righteousness.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The Present and Future Worlds are Enemies to Each Other.</head>
<p>Now the Lord declares, “No servant can serve two masters.”4360 If we desire, then, to
serve both God and mammon, it will be unprofitable for us. “For what will it profit if a man
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”4361 This world and the next are two enemies.
The one urges4362 to adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit; the other bids farewell to
these things. We cannot, therefore, be the friends of both; and it behoves us, by renouncing
the one, to make sure4363 of the other. Let us reckon4364 that it is better to hate the things
present, since they are trifling, and transient, and corruptible; and to love those <del>which are
to come,</del> as being good and incorruptible. For if we do the will of Christ, we shall find rest;
otherwise, nothing shall deliver us from eternal punishment, if we disobey His commandments.
For thus also saith the Scripture in Ezekiel, “If Noah, Job, and Daniel should rise
up, they should not deliver their children in captivity.”4365 Now, if men so eminently
righteous are not able by their righteousness to deliver their children, how4366 can we hope
to enter into the royal residence4367 of God unless we keep our baptism holy and undefiled?
Or who shall be our advocate, unless we be found possessed of works of holiness and
righteousness?</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—We Must Strive in Order to Be Crowned.</head>
<p>Wherefore, then, my brethren, let us struggle with all earnestness, knowing that the
contest is <del>in our case</del> close at hand, and that many undertake long voyages to strive for a
corruptible reward;4368 yet all are not crowned, but those only that have laboured hard and
striven gloriously. Let us therefore so strive, that we may all be crowned. Let us run the
straight4369 course, even the race that is incorruptible; and let us in great numbers set out4370
for it, and strive that we may be crowned. And should we not all be able to obtain the crown,
let us at least come near to it. We must remember4371 that he who strives in the corruptible
contest, if he be found acting unfairly,4372 is taken away and scourged, and cast forth from
the lists. What then think ye? If one does anything unseemly in the incorruptible contest,
what shall he have to bear? For of those who do not preserve the seal4373 <del>unbroken</del>, <del>the
Scripture</del> saith, “Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they
shall be a spectacle to all flesh.”4374</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Necessity of Repentance While We are on Earth.</head>
<p>As long, therefore, as we are upon earth, let us practise repentance, for we are as clay in
the hand of the artificer. For as the potter, if he make a vessel, and it be distorted or broken
in his hands, fashions it over again; but if he have before this cast it into the furnace of fire,
can no longer find any help for it: so let us also, while we are in this world, repent with our
whole heart of the evil deeds we have done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord,
while we have yet an opportunity of repentance. For after we have gone out of the world,
no further power of confessing or repenting will there belong to us. Wherefore, brethren,
by doing the will of the Father, and keeping the flesh holy, and observing the commandments
of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life. For the Lord saith in the Gospel, “If ye have not
kept that which was small, who will commit to you the great? For I say unto you, that he
that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much.”4375 This, then, is what He
means: “Keep the flesh holy and the seal undefiled, that4376 ye may receive eternal life.”4377</p>

the flesh, ye shall also come <del>to be judged</del> in the flesh. As Christ4379 the Lord who saved
us, though He was first a Spirit4380 became flesh, and thus called us, so shall we also receive
the reward in this flesh. Let us therefore love one another, that we may all attain to the
kingdom of God. While we have an opportunity of being healed, let us yield ourselves to
God that healeth us, and give to Him a recompense. Of what sort? Repentance out of a
sincere heart; for He knows all things beforehand, and is acquainted with what is in our
hearts. Let us therefore give Him praise, not with the mouth only, but also with the heart,
that He may accept us as sons. For the Lord has said, “Those are my brethren who do the

prophetic word also declares, “Wretched are those of a double mind, and who doubt in their
heart, who say, All these things4386 have we heard even in the times of our fathers; but
though we have waited day by day, we have seen none of them <del>accomplished</del>. Ye fools!
compare yourselves to a tree; take, for instance, the vine. First of all it sheds its leaves, then
the bud appears; after that the sour grape, and then the fully-ripened fruit. So, likewise, my
people have borne disturbances and afflictions, but afterwards shall they receive their good
things.”4387 Wherefore, my brethren, let us not be of a double mind, but let us hope and
endure, that we also may obtain the reward. For He is faithful who has promised that He
will bestow on every one a reward according to his works. If, therefore, we shall do righteousness
in the sight of God, we shall enter into His kingdom, and shall receive the promises,

one when His kingdom would come, replied, “When two shall be one, that which is without
as that which is within, and the male with the female, neither male nor female.”4389 Now,
two are one when we speak the truth one to another, and there is unfeignedly one soul in
two bodies. And “that which is without as” that which is within meaneth this: He calls the
soul “that which is within,” and the body “that which is without.” As, then, thy body is
visible to sight, so also let thy soul be manifest by good works. And “the male, with the female,
neither male nor female,” this4390 He saith, that brother seeing sister may have no
thought concerning her as female, and that she may have no thought concerning him as
male. “If ye do these things,” saith He, “the kingdom of my Father shall come.”4391</p>

<p>Brethren, then, let us now at length repent, let us soberly turn to that which is good; for

repenting from the heart be saved; and let us not be men-pleasers, nor be willing to please
one another only, but also the men without, for righteousness sake, that the name may not
be, because of us, blasphemed. For the Lord saith, “Continually my name is blasphemed
among all nations,” and “Wherefore my name is blasphemed; blasphemed in what? In your
not doing the things which I wish.”4392 For the nations, hearing from our mouth the oracles
of God, marvel at their excellence and worth; thereafter learning that our deeds are not
worthy of the words which we speak,—receiving this occasion they turn to blasphemy,
saying that they are a fable and a delusion. For, whenever they hear from us that God saith,
“No thank have ye, if ye love them which love you, but ye have thank, if ye love your enemies
and them which hate you”4393—whenever they hear these words, they marvel at the surpassing
measure of their goodness; but when they see, that not only do we not love those who
hate, but that we love not even those who love, they laugh us to scorn, and the name is
blasphemed.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—The Church Spiritual.</head>
<p>So, then, brethren, if we do the will of our Father God, we shall be members of the first
church, the spiritual,—that which was created before sun and moon; but if we shall not do
the will of the Lord, we shall come under the Scripture which saith, “My house became a
den of robbers.”4394 So, then, let us elect to belong to the church of life,4395 that we may
be saved. I think not that ye are ignorant that the living church is the body of Christ (for
the Scripture, saith, “God created man male and female;”4396 the male is Christ, the female
the church,) and that the Books4397 and the Apostles teach that the church is not of the
present, but from the beginning. For it was spiritual, as was also our Jesus, and was made
manifest at the end of the days in order to save you.4398 The church being spiritual, was
made manifest in the flesh of Christ, signifying to us that if any one of us shall preserve it
in the flesh and corrupt it not, he shall receive it in the Holy Spirit. For this flesh is the type
of the spirit; no one, therefore, having corrupted the type, will receive afterwards the antitype.
Therefore is it, then, that He saith, brethren, “Preserve ye the flesh, that ye may become
partakers of the spirit.” If we say that the flesh is the church and the spirit Christ, then it
follows that he who shall offer outrage to the flesh is guilty of outrage on the church. Such
an one, therefore, will not partake of the spirit, which is Christ. Such is the life and immortality,
which this flesh may afterwards receive, the Holy Spirit cleaving to it; and no one can
either express or utter what things the Lord hath prepared for His elect.4399</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—He Who Saves and He Who is Saved.</head>
<p>I think not that I counted trivial counsel concerning continence; following it, a man
will not repent thereof, but will save both himself and me who counselled.4400 For it is no
small reward to turn back a wandering and perishing soul for its salvation.4401 For this recompense
we are able to render to the God who created us, if he who speaks and hears both
speak and hear with faith and love. Let us, therefore, continue in that course in which we,
righteous and holy, believed, that with confidence we may ask God who saith, “Whilst thou
art still speaking, I will say, Here I am.”4402 For these words are a token of a great promise,
for the Lord saith that He is more ready to give than he who asks. So great, then, being the
goodness of which we are partakers, let us not grudge one another the attainment of so great
blessings. For in proportion to the pleasure with which these words are fraught to those
who shall follow them, in that proportion is the condemnation with which they are fraught
to those who shall refuse to hear.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Preparation for the Day of Judgment.</head>
<p>So, then, brethren, having received no small occasion to repent, while we have opportunity,
let us turn to God who called us, while yet we have One to receive us. For if we renounce
these indulgences and conquer the soul by not fulfilling its wicked desires, we shall
be partakers of the mercy of Jesus. Know ye that the day4403 of judgment draweth nigh like
a burning oven, and certain of the heavens and all the earth will melt, like lead melting in
fire; and then will appear the hidden and manifest deeds of men. Good, then, is alms as repentance
from sin; better is fasting than prayer, and alms than both; “charity covereth a
multitude of sins,”4404 and prayer out of a good conscience delivereth from death. Blessed
is every one that shall be found complete in these; for alms lightens the burden of sin.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Same Subject Continued.</head>
<p>Let us, then, repent with our whole heart, that no one of us may perish amiss. For if we
have commands and engage in withdrawing from idols and instructing others, how much
more ought a soul already knowing God not to perish. Rendering, therefore, mutual help,
let us raise the weak also in that which is good, that all of us may be saved and convert one
another and admonish. And not only now let us seem to believe and give heed, when we
are admonished by the elders;4405 but also when we take our departure home, let us remember
the commandments of the Lord, and not be allured back by worldly lusts, but let us often
and often draw near and try to make progress in the Lord’s commands, that we all having
the same mind may be gathered together for life. For the Lord said, “I come to gather all
nations <del>kindreds</del> and tongues.”4406 This means the day of His appearing, when He will
come and redeem us—each one according to his works. And the unbelievers will see His
glory and might, and, when they see the empire of the world in Jesus, they will be surprised,
saying, “Woe to us, because Thou wast, and we knew not and believed not and obeyed not
the elders4407 who show us plainly of our salvation.” And “their worm shall not die, neither
shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle unto all flesh.”4408 It is of the great
day of judgment He speaks, when they shall see those among us who were guilty of ungodliness
and erred in their estimate of the commands of Jesus Christ. The righteous, having
succeeded both in enduring the trials and hating the indulgences of the soul, whenever they
witness how those who have swerved and denied Jesus by words or deeds are punished with
grievous torments in fire unquenchable, will give glory to their God and say, “There will be
hope for him who has served God with his whole heart.”</p>

that ye may give heed to the words written,4411 that ye may save both yourselves and him
who reads an address in your midst. For as a reward I ask of you repentance with the whole
heart, while ye bestow upon yourselves salvation and life. For by so doing we shall set a
mark for all the young who wish to be diligent in godliness and the goodness of God. And
let not us, in our folly, feel displeasure and indignation, whenever any one admonishes us
and turns us from unrighteousness to righteousness. For there are some wicked deeds which
we commit, and know it not, because of the double-mindedness and unbelief present in our
breasts, and our understanding is darkened by vain desires. Let us, therefore, work righteousness,
that we may be saved to the end. Blessed are they who obey these commandments,
even if for a brief space they suffer in this world, and they will gather the imperishable fruit
of the resurrection. Let not the godly man, therefore, grieve; if for the present he suffer affliction,
blessed is the time that awaits him there; rising up to life again with the fathers he
will rejoice for ever without a grief.</p>

<p>But let it not even trouble your mind, that we see the unrighteous possessed of riches

of the living God we strive and are exercised in the present life, that we may obtain the crown
in that which is to come. No one of the righteous received fruit speedily, but waiteth for it.
For if God tendered the reward of the righteous in a trice, straightway were it commerce
that we practised, and not godliness. For it were as if we were righteous by following after
not godliness but gain; and for this reason the divine judgment baffled4412 the spirit that is
unrighteous and heavily weighed the fetter.</p>
<p>To the only God, invisible, Father of truth, who sent forth to us the Saviour and Author
of immortality, through whom He also manifested to us the truth and the heavenly life, to
Him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>The Apology of Aristides.</head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The Church Histories, hitherto in dealing with early Christian literature, have given
Aristides along with Quadratus the first place in the list of lost apologists. It was known
that there had been such early defenders of the faith, and that Quadratus had seen persons
who had been miraculously healed by Christ; but beyond this little more could be said. To
Justin Martyr, who flourished about a.d. 150, belonged the honour of heading the series of
apologists whose works are extant, viz., Tatian, Melito, Athenagoras, Theophilus, the author
of the Epistle to Diognetus, who all belonged to the second century and wrote in Greek; and
Tertullian, Minucius Felix, Arnobius, and Lactantius, who wrote in Latin, and Clement and
Origen who wrote in Greek, during the third century. While Christianity was winning its
way to recognition in the Roman empire, these writers tried to disprove the gross calumnies
current about Christians, to enlighten rulers and magistrates as to the real character and
conduct of the adherents of the new religion, and to remove the prejudice which led to the
violent persecutions of the populace. They also endeavoured to commend Christianity to
“the cultured among its despisers,” by showing that it is philosophy as well as revelation,
that it can supply the answers sought by philosophy, and is unlike human wisdom in being
certain because divinely revealed. At the same time they demonstrated the folly of polytheism
and pointed out its disastrous effects on morality. This faithful company of the defenders
of the faith has now regained Aristides as their leader in place of Justin Martyr. It will be
well to recount briefly what was previously known about Aristides, and to tell how the lost
Apology has been found.</p>
<p>Eusebius, in his History of the Church, written during the reign of Constantine, a.d.
306–337, has a chapter (bk. iv., c. 3) headed “The authors that wrote in defence of the faith
in the reign of Hadrian, a.d. 117–138.” After describing and quoting the Apology of
Quadratus, he adds:</p>
<p>“Aristides also, a man faithfully devoted to the religion we profess, like Quadratus, has
left to posterity a defence of the faith, addressed to Hadrian. This work is also preserved by
a great number, even to the present day.”</p>
<p>The same Eusebius in his Chronicon states that the Emperor Hadrian visited Athens in
the eighth year of his reign (i.e., a.d. 125 ) and took part in the Eleusinian mysteries. In the
same connection the historian mentions the presentation of Apologies to the Emperor by
Quadratus and Aristides, “an Athenian philosopher;” and implies that Hadrian was induced

<pb n="497"/>
by these appeals, coupled with a letter from Serenius Granianus, proconsul of Asia, to issue
an Imperial rescript forbidding the punishment of Christians without careful investigation
and trial.</p>
<p>About a century later Jerome (died a.d. 420) tells us that Aristides was a philosopher of
Athens, that he retained his philosopher’s garb after his conversion to Christianity, and that
he presented a defence of the faith to Hadrian at the same time as Quadratus. This Apology,
he says, was extant in his day, and was largely composed of the opinions of philosophers
(“contextum philosophorum sententiis”), and was afterwards imitated by Justin Martyr.</p>
<p>After this date Aristides passes out of view. In the mediæval martyrologies there is a
faint reflection of the earlier testimony, as, e.g., the 31st of August is given as the saint’s day
“of the blessed Aristides, most renowned for faith and wisdom, who presented books on
the Christian religion to the prince Hadrian, and most brilliantly proclaimed in the presence
of the Emperor himself how that Christ Jesus is the only God.”</p>
<p>In the seventeenth century there were rumours that the missing Apology of Aristides
was to be found in various monastic libraries in Greece; and Spon, a French traveller, made
a fruitless search for it. The book had apparently disappeared for ever.</p>
<p>But in recent times Aristides has again “swum into our ken.” Armenian literature,
which has done service to Christendom by preserving so many of its early documents, supplied
also the first news of the recovery of Aristides. In the Mechitarite convent of S. Lazarus
at Venice there is a body of Armenian monks who study Armenian and other literature.
In 1878 these Armenians surprised the learned world by publishing a Latin translation of
an Armenian fragment (the first two chapters) of the lost Apology of Aristides. Renan at
once set it down as spurious because it contained theological terms of a later age, e.g.,
“bearer of God” applied to the Virgin Mary. These terms were afterwards seen to be due to
the translator. At what time the translation from Greek into Armenian was made is not
apparent; but it may reasonably be connected with the work begun by the famous Armenian
patriarch Mesrobes. This noble Christian invented an alphabet for his country, established
schools, and sent a band of young Armenians to Edessa, Athens, and elsewhere with instructions
to translate into Armenian the best sacred and classical books. And in spite of Mohammedans
and Turks Armenia has remained Christian, and now restores to the world the
treasures committed to its keeping in the early centuries.</p>
<p>Opinions as to the Armenian fragment of Aristides remained undecided till 1889. In
the spring of that year Professor J. Rendel Harris, of Cambridge, had the honour of discovering
a Syriac version of the whole Apology in the library of the Convent of St. Catharine,
on Mount Sinai. He found the Apology of Aristides among a collection of Syriac treatises
of an ethical character; and he refers the ms. to the seventh century. Professor Harris has

<pb n="498"/>
translated the Syriac into English, and has carefully edited the Syriac text with minute discussions
of every point of interest.4413</p>
<p>The recovery of the Syriac version by Professor Harris placed the genuineness of the
Armenian fragment beyond question. It also led to the strange reappearance of the greater
part of the original Greek. Professor J. A. Robinson, the general editor of the Cambridge
Texts and Studies, having read the translation of the Syriac version, discovered that the
Apology of Aristides is incorporated in the early Christian Romance entitled, The Life of
Barlaam and Josaphat.</p>
<p>Some account must be given of this remarkable book in order to show its connection
with the Apology of Aristides. Its author is said to be John of Damascus, who died about
a.d. 760. Whoever wrote it, the book soon became very popular. In the East it was translated
into Arabic, Ethiopic, Armenian, and Hebrew; in the West there are versions of it in nearly
a dozen languages, including an English metrical rendering. As early as 1204 a king of
Norway had it translated into Icelandic. It is now known to be the story of Buddha in a
Christian setting, furnished with fables and parables which have migrated from the far East
and can be traced back to an extreme antiquity.</p>
<p>The outline of the story is as follows: A king in India, Abenner by name, who is an enemy
of the Christians, has an only son Josaphat (or Joasaph). At his birth the astrologers predict
that he will become great, but will embrace the new doctrine. To prevent this, his father
surrounds the prince with young and beautiful attendants, and takes care that Josaphat shall
see nothing of illness, old age, or death. At length Josaphat desires his freedom, and then
follow the excursions as in the case of Buddha. Josaphat seeing so much misery possible in
life is sunk in despair. In this state he is visited by a Christian hermit—Barlaam by name.
Josaphat is converted to Christianity, and Barlaam withdraws again to the desert.</p>
<p>To undo his son’s conversion the king arranges that a public disputation shall be held;
one of the king’s sages, Nachor by name, is to personate Barlaam and to make a very weak
statement of the Christian case, and so be easily refuted by the court orators. When the day
comes, the prince Josaphat charges Nachor, the fictitious monk, to do his best on pain of
torture. Thus stimulated, Nachor begins, and “like Balaam’s ass he spake that which he had
not purposed to speak; and he said, ‘I, O king, in the providence of God,’ etc.” He then recites
the Apology of Aristides to such purpose that he converts himself, the king, and all his
people. Josaphat finally relinquishes his kingdom, and retires into the desert with the
genuine Barlaam for prayer and meditation. Not only so, but the churches of the Middle
Ages, forgetting the fabulous character of the story, raised Barlaam and Josaphat to the rank

of saints, with a holy day in the Christian calendar. Thus the author of Barlaam and Josaphat
caused Christianity unwittingly to do honour to the founder of Buddhism under the name
of St. Josaphat; and also to read the Apology of Aristides in nearly twenty languages without
suspecting what it was.</p>
<p>The speech of Nachor in Greek, that is to say, the greater part of the original Greek of
the Apology of Aristides, has been extracted from this source by Professor Robinson and is
published in Texts and Studies, Vol. I., so that there is now abundant material for making
an estimate of Aristides.</p>
<p>It may be asked whether we have in any of our three sources the actual words of Aristides.
The circumstances under which the Apology was incorporated in The Life of Barlaam
and Josaphat are such as to render it unlikely that the author of the Romance should copy
with the faithfulness of a scribe; but examination proves that very few modifications hare
been made. The Greek divides men into three races (the Syriac and Armenian into four);
the introductory accounts of these races are in the Greek blended with the general discussion;
and at the close the description of early Christian customs is shortened. These few differences
from the Syriac are all explained by the fact that the Apology had to be adapted to the circumstances
of an Indian court in a later age. On the other hand, when the Syriac is compared.
with the Greek and Armenian in passages where these two agree, it is found that explanatory
clauses are added; and there is throughout a cumbrous redundancy of pronouns in the
Syriac. In short, the actual words of Aristides may be restored with tolerable certainty—a
task which has been already accomplished by a German scholar, Lic. Edgar Hennecke.4414
In any case we have the substance of the Apology of Aristides with almost verbal precision.</p>
<p>In regard to the date of Aristides, Eusebius says expressly that the Apology was presented
to Hadrian while he was in Athens about the year a.d. 125. The only ground for questioning
this statement is the second superscription given in the Syriac version, which implies that
the Apology was presented to Antoninus Pius, a.d. 138–161. This heading is accepted by
Professor Harris as the true one; and he assigns the Apology to “the early years of the reign
of Antoninus Pius; and it is at least conceivable,” he adds, “that it may have been presented
to the Emperor along with other Christian writings during an unrecorded visit of his to his
ancient seat of government at Smyrna.” But this requires us to suppose that Eusebius was
wrong; that Jerome copied his error; that the Armenian version curiously fell into the same
mistake; and that the Syriac translator is at this point exceptionally faithful. So perhaps it
is better with Billius, “not to trust more in one’s own suspicions, than in Christian charity
which believeth all things,” and to rest in the comfortable hypothesis that Eusebius spoke
the truth.</p>

Griechischen Apologeten: Heft 3.)</note>

<pb n="500"/>
<p>Writing in a.d. 125, or even twenty years later, Aristides becomes an important witness
as to the nature of early Christianity. His Apology contains no express quotation from
Scripture; but the Emperor is referred for information to a gospel which is written. Various
echoes of New Testament expressions will at once be recognized; and “the language
moulding power of Christianity” is discernible in the new meaning given to various classical
words. Some topics are conspicuous by their absence. Aristides has no trace of ill-feeling
to the Jews; no reference to the Logos doctrine, nor to the distinctive ideas of the Apostle
Paul; he has no gnosticism or heresy to denounce, and he makes no appeal to miracle and
prophecy. Christianity, in his view, is worthy of a philosophic emperor because it is eminently
reasonable, and gives an impulse and power to live a good life. On the whole, Aristides
represents that type of Christian practice which is found in the Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles; and to this he adds a simple Christian philosophy which may be compared with
that of St. Paul at Athens. Although the details about the elements and the heathen gods
are discussed with tedious minuteness, still his closing section describing the lives of the
early Christians should always be good reading.</p>
<p>The translation of the Syriac given here is independently made from the Syriac text,
edited by Professor Harris4415. Full advantage has been taken of his notes and apparatus
criticus, but no use has been made of his translation. In obscure passages the German
translation of Dr. Richard Raabe4416 has been compared; and the Text-Rekonstruktion of
Hennecke has been consulted on textual points in both translations. The Greek translation
is made from the text edited by Professor Robinson.4417 The translations from the Greek
and from the Syriac are arranged side by side, so that their relation to one another is apparent
at a glance. No attempt has been made to force the same English words from passages which
are evidently meant to be identical in the two languages; but the literal tenour of each has
been allowed to assert itself.</p>

<head>The Apology of Aristides
as it is preserved in the history of
Barlaam and Josaphat.
Translated from the Greek.</head>
<p>I. I, O King in the providence of God came into the world; and when I had considered
the heaven and the earth, the sun and the moon and the rest, I marvelled at their orderly
arrangement.</p>
<p>And when I saw that the universe and all that is therein is moved by necessity, I perceived
that the mover and controller is God.</p>
<p>For everything which causes motion is stronger than that which is moved, and that
which controls is stronger than that which is controlled.</p>
<p>The self-same being, then, who first established and now controls the universe—him
do I affirm to be God who is without beginning and without end, immortal and self-sufficing,
above all passions and infirmities, above anger and forgetfulness and ignorance and the rest.</p>
<p>Through Him too all things consist. He requires not sacrifice and libation nor anyone
of the things that appear to sense; but all men stand in need of Him.</p>
<p>II. Having thus spoken concerning God, so far as it was possible for me to speak of
Him,4418 let us next proceed to the human race, that we may see which of them participate
in the truth and which of them in error.</p>
<p>For it is clear to us, O King,4419 that there are three4420 classes of men in this world;
these being the worshippers of the gods acknowledged among you, and Jews, and Christians.
<note type="footnote">4418 The Greek might be rendered, “so far as there was room for me to speak of Him,” i.e., the attributes of
the Deity are not further relevant to the discussion—as the translator into Syriac takes it. The Armenian adopts
the other meaning, viz., the theme is beyond man’s power to discuss. As translated by F. C. Conybeare, the
Armenian is in these words: “Now by the grace of God it was given me to speak wisely concerning Him. So far
as I have received the faculty I will speak, yet not according to the measure of the inscrutability of His greatness
shall I be able to do so, but by faith alone do I glorify and adore Him.”</note>
<note type="footnote">4419 The “King” in the Greek is Abenner, the father of Josaphat; in the Syriac, as in the Greek originally, he
is the Roman Emperor, Hadrian.</note>
<note type="footnote">4420 The Armenian and Syriac agree in giving four races, which was probably the original division. To a
Greek, men were either Greeks or Barbarians; to a Greek Christian it would seem necessary to add two new
peoples, Jews and Christians. The Greek calls the Barbarians “Chaldæans.” This change of classification is</note>

<pb n="502"/>
Further they who pay homage to many gods are themselves divided into three classes,
Chaldæans namely, and Greeks, and Egyptians; for these have been guides and preceptors
to the rest of the nations in the service and worship of these many-titled deities.</p>
<p>III. Let us see then which of them participate in truth and which of them in error.</p>
<p>The Chaldæans, then, not knowing God went astray after the elements and began to
worship the creation more than their Creator.</p>
<p>And of these they formed certain shapes and styled them a representation of the heaven
and the earth and the sea, of the sun too and the moon and the other primal bodies or luminaries.
And they shut them up together in shrines, and worship them, calling them gods,
even though they have to guard them securely for fear they should be stolen by robbers.
And they did not perceive that anything which acts as guard is greater than that which is
guarded, and that he who makes is greater than that which is made. For if their gods are
unfit to look after their own safety, how shall they bestow protection upon others? Great
then is the error into which the Chaldæans wandered in adoring lifeless and good-fornothing
images.</p>
<p>And it occurs to me as surprising, O King, how it is that their so-called philosophers
have quite failed to observe that the elements themselves are perishable. And if the elements
are perishable and subject to necessity, how are they gods? And if the elements are not gods,
how do the images made in their honour come to be gods?</p>
<p>IV. Let us proceed then, O King, to the elements themselves that we may show in regard
to them that they are not gods, but perishable and mutable, produced out of that which did
not exist at the command of the true God, who is indestructible and immutable and invisible;
yet He sees all things and as He wills, modifies and changes things. What then shall I say
concerning the elements?</p>
<p>They err who believe that the sky is a god. For we see that it revolves and moves by
necessity and is compacted of many parts, being thence called the ordered universe (Kosmos).
Now the universe is the construction of some designer; and that which has been constructed
has a beginning and an end. And the sky with its luminaries moves by necessity. For the
stars are carried along in array at fixed intervals from sign to sign, and, some setting, others
rising, they traverse their courses in due season so as to mark off summers and winters, as
it has been appointed for them by God; and obeying the inevitable necessity of their nature
they transgress not their proper limits, keeping company with the heavenly order. Whence
it is plain that the sky is not a god but rather a work of God.</p>
<p>They erred also who believed the earth to be a goddess. For we see that it is despitefully
used and tyrannized over by men, and is furrowed and kneaded and becomes of no account.
<note type="footnote">probably the cause of the omission in the Greek of the preliminary accounts of the four classes. The Greek
blends the summaries with the fuller accounts.</note>

For, if it be burned with fire, it becomes devoid of life; for nothing will grow from the ashes.
Besides if there fall upon it an excess of rain it dissolves away, both it and its fruits. Moreover
it is trodden under foot of men and the other creatures; it is dyed with the blood of the
murdered; it is dug open and filled with dead bodies and becomes a tomb for corpses. In
face of all this, it is inadmissible that the earth is a goddess but rather it is a work of God for
the use of men.</p>
<p>V. They also erred who believed the water to be a god. For it, too, has been made for
the use of men, and is controlled by them; it is defiled and destroyed and suffers change on
being boiled and dyed with colours; and it is congealed by the frost, and polluted with blood,
and is introduced for the washing of all unclean things. Wherefore it is impossible that
water should be a god, but it is a work of God.</p>
<p>They also err who believe that fire is a god. For fire was made for the use of men, and
it is controlled by them, being carried about from place to place for boiling and roasting all
kinds of meat, and even for (the burning of) dead bodies. Moreover it is extinguished in
many ways, being quenched through man’s agency. So it cannot be allowed that fire is a
god, but it is a work of God.</p>
<p>They also err who think the blowing of the winds is a goddess. For it is clear that it is
under the dominion of another; and for the sake of man it has been designed by God for
the transport of ships and the conveyance of grain and for man’s other wants. It rises too
and falls at the bidding of God, whence it is concluded that the blowing of the winds is not
a goddess but only a work of God.</p>
<p>VI. They also err who believe the sun to be a god. For we see that it moves by necessity
and revolves and passes from sign to sign, setting and rising so as to give warmth to plants
and tender shoots for the use of man.</p>
<p>Besides it has its part in common with the rest of the stars, and is much smaller than
the sky; it suffers eclipse of its light and is not the subject of its own laws. Wherefore it is
concluded that the sun is not a god, but only a work of God. They also err who believe that
the moon is a goddess. For we see that it moves by necessity and revolves and passes from
sign to sign, setting and rising for the benefit of men; and it is less than the sun and waxes
and wanes and has eclipses. Wherefore it is concluded that the moon is not a goddess but
a work of God.</p>
<p>VII. They also err who believe that man4421 is a god. For we see that he is moved by
necessity, and is made to grow up, and becomes old even though he would not. And at one
time he is joyous, at another he is grieved when he lacks food and drink and clothing. And
<note type="footnote">4421 “I do not think it out of place here to mention Antinous of our day <del>a slave of the Emperor Hadrian</del>,
whom all, not withstanding they knew who and whence he was, yet affected to worship as a god.”—Justin
Martyr quoted in Eusebius Hist. Bk. IV., c. 8.</note>

<pb n="504"/>
we see that he is subject to anger and jealousy and desire and change of purpose and has
many infirmities. He is destroyed too in many ways by means of the elements and animals,
and by ever-assailing death. It cannot be admitted, then, that man is a god, but only a work
of God.</p>
<p>Great therefore is the error into which the Chaldæans wandered, following after their
own desires.</p>
<p>For they reverence the perishable elements and lifeless images, and do not perceive that
they themselves make these things to be gods.</p>
<p>VIII. Let us proceed then to the Greeks, that we may see whether they have any discernment
concerning God. The Greeks, indeed, though they call themselves wise proved more
deluded than the Chaldæans in alleging that many gods have come into being, some of them
male, some female, practised masters in every passion and every variety of folly. <del>And the
Greeks themselves represented them to be adulterers and murderers, wrathful and envious
and passionate, slayers of fathers and brothers, thieves and robbers, crippled and limping,
workers in magic, and victims of frenzy. Some of them died (as their account goes), and
some were struck by thunderbolts, and became slaves to men, and were fugitives, and they
mourned and lamented, and changed themselves into animals for wicked and shameful
ends.</del>4422</p>
<p>Wherefore, O King, they are ridiculous and absurd and impious tales that the Greeks
have introduced, giving the name of gods to those who are not gods, to suit their unholy
desires, in order that, having them as patrons of vice, they might commit adultery and robbery
and do murder and other shocking deeds. For if their gods did such deeds why should not
they also do them?</p>
<p>So that from these misguided practices it has been the lot of mankind to have frequent
wars and slaughters and bitter captivities.</p>
<p>IX. But, further, if we be minded to discuss their gods individually, you will see how
great is the absurdity; for instance, how Kronos is brought forward by them as a god above
all, and they sacrifice their own children to him. And he had many sons by Rhea, and in
his madness devoured his own offspring. And they say that Zeus cut off his members and
cast them into the sea, whence Aphrodite is said in fable to be engendered. Zeus, then,
having bound his own father, cast him into Tartaros. You see the error and brutality which
they advance against their god? Is it possible, then, that a god should be manacled and
mutilated? What absurdity! Who with any wit would ever say so?</p>
<p>Next Zeus is introduced, and they say that he was king of their gods, and that he changed
himself into animals that he might debauch mortal women.</p>
<note type="footnote">4422 The passage in brackets occurs earlier in “Barlaam and Josaphat,” and is restored to its place by J. A.
Robinson.</note>

<pb n="505"/>
<p>For they allege that he transformed himself into a bull for Europe, and into gold for
Danae, and into a swan for Leda, and into a satyr for Antiope, and into a thunderbolt for
Semele. Then by these there were many children, Dionysos and Zethus and Amphion and
Herakles and Apollo and Artemis and Perseus, Kastor and Helenes and Polydeukes and
Minos and Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon, and the nine daughters whom they called the
Muses. Then too they bring forward statements about the matter of Ganymedes.</p>
<p>Hence it happened, O King, to mankind to imitate all these things and to become
adulterous men and lascivious women, and to be workers of other terrible iniquities, through
the imitation of their god. Now how is it possible that a god should be an adulterer or an
obscene person or a parricide?</p>
<p>X. Along with him, too, they bring forward one Hephaistos as a god, and they say that
he is lame and wields a hammer and tongs, working as a smith for his living.
Is he then badly off? But it cannot be admitted that a god should be a cripple, and besides
be dependent on mankind.</p>
<p>Then they bring forward Hermes as a god, representing him to be lustful, and a thief,
and covetous, and a magician (and maimed) and an interpreter of language. But it cannot
be admitted that such an one is a god.</p>
<p>They also bring forward Asklepios as a god who is a doctor and prepares drugs and
compounds plasters for the sake of a living. For he was badly off. And afterwards he was
struck, they say, with a thunderbolt by Zeus on account of Tyndareos, son of Lacedaimon;
and so was killed. Now if Asklepios in spite of his divinity could not help himself when
struck by lightning, how will he come to the rescue of others?</p>
<p>Again Ares is represented as a god, fond of strife and given to jealousy, and a lover of
animals and other such things. And at last while corrupting Aphrodite, he was bound by
the youthful Eros and by Hephaistos. How then was he a god who was subject to desire,
and a warrior, and a prisoner and an adulterer?</p>
<p>They allege that Dionysos also is a god who holds nightly revels and teaches drunkenness,
and carries off the neighbours’ wives, and goes mad and takes to flight. And at last he was
put to death by the Titans. If then Dionysos could not save himself when he was being
killed, and besides used to be mad, and drunk with wine, and a fugitive, how should he be
a god?</p>
<p>They allege also that Herakles got drunk and went mad and cut the throats of his own
children, then he was consumed by fire and so died. Now how should he be a god, who was
drunk and a slayer of children and burned to death? or how will he come to the help of
others, when he was unable to help himself?</p>
<p>XI. They represent Apollo also as a jealous god, and besides as the master of the bow
and quiver, and sometimes of the lyre and flute, and as divining to men for pay? Can he

<pb n="506"/>
then be very badly off? But it cannot be admitted that a god should be in want, and jealous,
and a harping minstrel.</p>
<p>They represent Artemis also as his sister, who is a huntress and has a bow with a quiver;
and she roams alone upon the hills with the dogs to hunt the stag or the wild boar. How
then should such a woman, who hunts and roams with her dogs, be a divine being?</p>
<p>Even Aphrodite herself they affirm to be a goddess who is adulterous. For at one time
she had Ares as a paramour, and at another time Anchises and again Adonis, whose death
she also laments, feeling the want of her lover. And they say that she even went down to
Hades to purchase back Adonis from Persephone. Did you ever see, O King, greater folly
than this, to bring forward as a goddess one who is adulterous and given to weeping and
wailing?</p>
<p>And they represent that Adonis is a hunter god, who came to a violent end, being
wounded by a wild boar and having no power to help himself in his distress. How then will
one who is adulterous and a hunter and mortal give himself any concern for mankind?</p>
<p>All this and much more of a like nature, and even far more disgraceful and offensive
details, have the Greeks narrated, O King, concerning their gods;—details which it is not
proper either to state or for a moment to remember. And hence mankind, taking an impulse
from their gods, practised all lawlessness and brutality and impiety, polluting both earth
and air by their awful deeds.</p>
<p>XII. The Egyptians, again, being more stupid and witless than these have gone further
astray than all the nations. For they were not content with the objects of worship of the
Chaldæans and the Greeks, but in addition to these brought forward also brute creatures
as gods, both land and water animals, and plants and herbs; and they were defiled with all
madness and brutality more deeply than all the nations on the earth.</p>
<p>For originally they worshipped Isis, who had Osiris as brother and husband. He was
slain by his own brother Typhon; and therefore Isis with Horos her son fled for refuge to
Byblus in Syria, mourning for Osiris with bitter lamentation, until Horos grew up and slew
Typhon. So that neither had Isis power to help her own brother and husband; nor could
Osiris defend himself when he was being slain by Typhon; nor did Typhon, the slayer of his
brother, when he was perishing at the hands of Horos and Isis, find means to rescue himself
from death. And though they were revealed in their true character by such mishaps, they
were believed to be very gods by the simple Egyptians, who were not satisfied even with
these or the other deities of the nations, but brought forward also brute creatures as gods.
For some of them worshipped the sheep, and some the goat; another tribe (worshipped)
the bull and the pig; others again, the raven and the hawk, and the vulture and the eagle;
and others the crocodile; and some the cat and the dog, and the wolf and the ape, and the
dragon and the asp; and others the onion and the garlic and thorns and other created things.
And the poor creatures do not perceive about all these that they are utterly helpless. For

<pb n="507"/>
though they see their gods eaten by men of other tribes, and burnt as offerings and slain as
victims and mouldering in decay, they have not perceived that they are not gods.</p>
<p>XIII. So the Egyptians and the Chaldæans and the Greeks made a great error in bringing
forward such beings as gods, and in making images of them, and in deifying dumb and
senseless idols.</p>
<p>And I wonder how they saw their gods sawn out and hacked and docked by the workmen,
and besides aging with time and falling to pieces, and being cast from metal, and yet did
not discern concerning them that they were not gods.</p>
<p>For when they have no power to see to their own safety, how will they take forethought
for men?</p>
<p>But further, the poets and philosophers, alike of the Chaldæans and the Greeks and the
Egyptians, while they desired by their poems and writings to magnify the gods of their
countries, rather revealed their shame, and laid it bare before all men. For if the body of
man while consisting of many parts does not cast off any of its own members, but preserving
an unbroken unity in all its members, is harmonious with itself, how shall variance and
discord be so great in the nature of God?</p>
<p>For if there had been a unity of nature among the gods, then one god ought not to have
pursued or slain or injured another. And if the gods were pursued by gods, and slain, and
kidnapped and struck with lightning by them, then there is no longer any unity of nature,
but divided counsels, all mischievous. So that not one of them is a god. It is clear then, O
King, that all their discourse on the nature of the gods is an error.</p>
<p>But how did the wise and erudite men of the Greeks not observe that inasmuch as they
make laws for themselves they are judged by their own laws? For if the laws are righteous,
their gods are altogether unrighteous, as they have committed transgressions of laws, in
slaying one another, and practising sorceries, and adultery and thefts and intercourse with
males. If they were right in doing these things, then the laws are unrighteous, being framed
contrary to the gods. Whereas in fact, the laws are good and just, commending what is good
and forbidding what is bad. But the deeds of their gods are contrary to law. Their gods,
therefore, are lawbreakers, and all liable to the punishment of death; and they are impious
men who introduce such gods. For if the stories about them be mythical, the gods are
nothing more than mere names; and if the stories be founded on nature, still they who did
and suffered these things are no longer gods; and if the stories be allegorical, they are myths
and nothing more.</p>
<p>It has been shown then, O King, that all these polytheistic objects of worship are the
works of error and perdition. For it is not right to give the name of gods to beings which
may be seen but cannot see; but one ought to reverence the invisible and all-seeing and allcreating
God.</p>

<pb n="508"/>
<p>XIV. Let us proceed then, O King, to the Jews also, that we may see what truth there is
in their view of God. For they were descendants of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and migrated
to Egypt. And thence God brought them forth with a mighty hand and an uplifted
arm through Moses, their lawgiver; and by many wonders and signs He made known His
power to them. But even they proved stubborn and ungrateful, and often served the idols
of the nations, and put to death the prophets and just men who were sent to them. Then
when the Son of God was pleased to come upon the earth, they received him with wanton
violence and betrayed him into the hands of Pilate the Roman governor; and paying no respect
to his good deeds and the countless miracles he wrought among them, they demanded
a sentence of death by the cross.</p>
<p>And they perished by their own transgression; for to this day they worship the one God
Almighty, but not according to knowledge. For they deny that Christ is the Son of God;
and they are much like to the heathen, even although they may seem to make some approach
to the truth from which they have removed themselves. So much for the Jews.</p>
<p>XV. Now the Christians4423 trace their origin from the Lord Jesus Christ. And He is
acknowledged by the Holy Spirit to be the son of the most high God, who came down from
heaven for the salvation of men. And being born of a pure virgin, unbegotten and immaculate,
He assumed flesh and revealed himself among men that He might recall them to
Himself from their wandering after many gods. And having accomplished His wonderful
dispensation, by a voluntary choice He tasted death on the cross, fulfilling an august dispensation.
And after three days He came to life again and ascended into heaven. And if you
would read, O King, you may judge the glory of His presence from the holy gospel writing,
as it is called among themselves. He had twelve disciples, who after His ascension to heaven
went forth into the provinces of the whole world, and declared His greatness. As for instance,
one of them traversed the countries about us, proclaiming the doctrine of the truth. From
this it is, that they who still observe the righteousness enjoined by their preaching are called
Christians.</p>
<p>And these are they who more than all the nations on the earth have found the truth.
For they know God, the Creator and Fashioner of all things through the only-begotten Son
and the Holy Spirit4424; and beside Him they worship no other God. They have the commands
of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself graven upon their hearts; and they observe them,
looking forward to the resurrection of the dead and life in the world to come. They do not
commit adultery nor fornication, nor bear false witness, nor covet the things of others; they
honour father and mother, and love their neighbours; they judge justly, and they never do
to others what they would not wish to happen to themselves; they appeal to those who injure
<note type="footnote">4423 This, the “Christological” passage, occurs earlier in the Syriac. Chap. II.</note>

<pb n="509"/>
them, and try to win them as friends; they are eager to do good to their enemies; they are
gentle and easy to be entreated; they abstain from all unlawful conversation and from all
impurity; they despise not the widow, nor oppress the orphan; and he that has, gives ungrudgingly
for the maintenance of him who has not.</p>
<p>If they see a stranger, they take him under their roof, and rejoice over him as over a very
brother; for they call themselves brethren not after the flesh but after the spirit.</p>
<p>And they are ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of Christ; for they observe His
commands without swerving, and live holy and just lives, as the Lord God enjoined upon
them.</p>
<p>And they give thanks unto Him every hour, for all meat and drink and other blessings.</p>
<p>XVI. Verily then, this is the way of the truth which leads those who travel therein to
the everlasting kingdom promised through Christ in the life to come. And that you may
know, O King, that in saying these things I do not speak at my own instance, if you deign
to look into the writings of the Christians, you will find that I state nothing beyond the
truth. Rightly then, did thy son4425 apprehend, and justly was he taught to serve the living
God and to be saved for the age that is destined to come upon us. For great and wonderful
are the sayings and deeds of the Christians; for they speak not the words of men but those
of God. But the rest of the nations go astray and deceive themselves; for they walk in darkness
and bruise themselves like drunken men.</p>
<p>XVII. Thus far, O King, extends my discourse to you, which has been dictated in my
mind by the Truth.4426 Wherefore let thy foolish sages cease their idle talk against the Lord;
for it is profitable for you to worship God the Creator, and to give ear to His incorruptible
words, that ye may escape from condemnation and punishment, and be found to be heirs
of life everlasting.</p>

but, according to the story, he was constrained to speak what he had not intended. It is evidently the author’s

monk.</note>

<head>The Apology of Aristides the Philosopher.</head>

<p>Here follows the defence which Aristides the philosopher made before Hadrian the
King on behalf of reverence for God.</p>
<p><gap reason="omitted"/>All-powerful Cæsar Titus Hadrianus Antoninus, venerable and merciful, from Marcianus
Aristides, an Athenian philosopher.4427</p>
<p>I. I, O King, by the grace of God came into this world; and when I had considered the
heaven and the earth and the seas, and had surveyed the sun and the rest of creation, I
marvelled at the beauty of the world. And I perceived that the world and all that is therein
are moved by the power of another; and I understood that he who moves them is God, who
is hidden in them, and veiled by them. And it is manifest that that which causes motion is
more powerful than that which is moved. But that I should make search concerning this
same mover of all, as to what is his nature (for it seems to me, he is indeed unsearchable in
his nature), and that I should argue as to the constancy of his government, so as to grasp it
fully,—this is a vain effort for me; for it is not possible that a man should fully comprehend
it. I say, however, concerning this mover of the world, that he is God of all, who made all
things for the sake of mankind. And it seems to me that this is reasonable, that one should
fear God and should not oppress man.</p>
<note type="footnote">4427 The superscription seems to be duplicate in the Syriac. It is absent from the Greek as we have it; the
Armenian has “To the Emperor Cæsar Hadrian from Aristides.” Various explanations are offered. (a) Both
emperors, as colleagues, may be meant. In support of this the Syriac adjectives for “venerable and merciful” are
marked plural; the phrase “Your majesty” occurring later has a plural suffix; and two Imperatives, “Take and
read,” are plural. On the other hand “O King” occurs constantly in the singular; and the emperors were colleagues
only for a few months in the year a.d. 138. (b) The longer heading is the true one—the shorter being due perhaps
to a scribe who had a collection of works to copy. In that case the word “Hadrian” has been selected from the
full title of Antonine, and the two adjectives “venerable and merciful” are proper names, Augustus Pius. (Harris.)
(c) The shorter heading has the support of Eusebius and the Armenian version; and the translator into Syriac
may have amplified. (***) Almighty is separated from the word for “God” by a pause, and is not an attribute
which a Christian would care to apply to a Roman emperor. παντοκράτωρ may have been confounded with
αὐ τοκράτωρ. Raabe supplies *** giving the sense “qui imperium (postatem) habet,” as an epithet of Cæsar. If
*** ="Renewed, or dedicated again to***Antoninus Pius,” could be read, both headings might be retained.</note>

<pb n="511"/>
<p>I say, then, that God is not born, not made, an ever-abiding nature without beginning
and without end, immortal, perfect, and incomprehensible. Now when I say that he is
“perfect,” this means that there is not in him any defect, and he is not in need of anything
but all things are in need of him. And when I say that he is “without beginning,” this means
that everything which has beginning has also an end, and that which has an end may be
brought to an end. He has no name, for everything which has a name is kindred to things
created. Form he has none, nor yet any union of members; for whatsoever possesses these
is kindred to things fashioned. He is neither male nor female.4428 The heavens do not
limit him, but the heavens and all things, visible and invisible, receive their bounds from
him. Adversary he has none, for there exists not any stronger than he. Wrath and indignation
he possesses not, for there is nothing which is able to stand against him. Ignorance
and forgetfulness are not in his nature, for he is altogether wisdom and understanding; and
in Him stands fast all that exists. He requires not sacrifice and libation, nor even one of
things visible; He requires not aught from any, but all living creatures stand in need of him.</p>
<p>II. Since, then, we have addressed you concerning God, so far as our discourse can bear
upon him, let us now come to the race of men, that we may know which of them participate
in the truth of which we have spoken, and which of them go astray from it.</p>
<p>This is clear to you, O King, that there are four classes of men in this world:—Barbarians
and Greeks, Jews and Christians. The Barbarians, indeed, trace the origin of their kind of
religion from Kronos and from Rhea and their other gods; the Greeks, however, from Helenos,
who is said to be sprung from Zeus. And by Helenos there were born Aiolos and
Xuthos; and there were others descended from Inachos and Phoroneus, and lastly from the
Egyptian Danaos and from Kadmos and from Dionysos.</p>
<p>The Jews, again, trace the origin of their race from Abraham, who begat Isaac, of whom
was born Jacob. And he begat twelve sons who migrated from Syria to Egypt; and there
they were called the nation of the Hebrews, by him who made their laws; and at length they
were named Jews.</p>
<p>The Christians, then, trace the beginning of their religion from Jesus the Messiah; and
he is named the Son of God Most High. And it is said that God came down from heaven,
and from a Hebrew virgin assumed and clothed himself with flesh; and the Son of God lived
in a daughter of man. This is taught in the gospel, as it is called, which a short time ago was
preached among them; and you also if you will read therein, may perceive the power which
belongs to it. This Jesus, then, was born of the race of the Hebrews; and he had twelve disciples
in order that the purpose of his incarnation4429 might in time be accomplished. But
<note type="footnote">4428 The Armenian adds, “For that which is subject to this distinction is moved by passions.”</note>
<note type="footnote">4429 Literally: “a certain dispensation of his.” The Greek term οἰκονομία, “dispensation,” suggests to the
translator into Syriac the idea of the Incarnation, familiar, as it seems, by his time. Professor Sachau reads the
equivalent of θαυμαστή instead of***(τις). In the translation given *** is taken adverbially = aliquamdiu.</note>

<pb n="512"/>
he himself was pierced by the Jews, and he died and was buried; and they say that after three
days he rose and ascended to heaven. Thereupon these twelve disciples went forth
throughout the known parts of the world, and kept showing his greatness with all modesty
and uprightness. And hence also those of the present day who believe that preaching are
called Christians, and they are become famous.</p>
<p>So then there are, as I said above, four classes of men:—Barbarians and Greeks, Jews
and Christians.</p>
<p>Moreover the wind is obedient to God, and fire to the angels; the waters also to the
demons and the earth to the sons of men.4430</p>
<p>III. Let us begin, then, with the Barbarians, and go on to the rest of the nations one
after another, that we may see which of them hold the truth as to God and which of them
hold error.</p>
<p>The Barbarians, then, as they did not apprehend God, went astray among the elements,
and began to worship things created instead of their Creator;4431 and for this end they made
images and shut them up in shrines, and lo! they worship them, guarding them the while
with much care, lest their gods be stolen by robbers. And the Barbarians did not observe
that that which acts as guard is greater than that which is guarded, and that everyone who
creates is greater than that which is created. If it be, then, that their gods are too feeble to
see to their own safety, how will they take thought for the safety of men? Great then is the
error into which the Barbarians wandered in worshipping lifeless images which can do
nothing to help them. And I am led to wonder, O King, at their philosophers, how that
even they went astray, and gave the name of gods to images which were made in honour of
the elements; and that their sages did not perceive that the elements also are dissoluble and
perishable. For if a small part of an element is dissolved or destroyed, the whole of it may
be dissolved and destroyed. If then the elements themselves are dissolved and destroyed
and forced to be subject to another that is more stubborn than they, and if they are not in
their nature gods, why, forsooth, do they call the images which are made in their honour,
God? Great, then, is the error which the philosophers among them have brought upon their
followers.</p>
<p>IV. Let us turn now, O King, to the elements in themselves, that we may make clear in
regard to them, that they are not gods, but a created thing, liable to ruin and change, which
is of the same nature as man; whereas God is imperishable and unvarying, and invisible,
while yet He sees, and overrules, and transforms all things.</p>
<note type="footnote">4430 This irrelevant sentence is found in the Armenian version also, and therefore was probably in the original
Greek. It seems to be an obiter dictum. Men fall into four groups, and, by the way, so do the elements, air, fire,
earth, and water; and the powers that govern them. One quaternion suggests others.</note>

<p>Those then who believe concerning the earth that it is a god have hitherto deceived
themselves, since it is furrowed and set with plants and trenched; and it takes in the filthy
refuse of men and beasts and cattle. And at times it becomes unfruitful, for if it be burnt to
ashes it becomes devoid of life, for nothing germinates from an earthen jar. And besides if
water be collected upon it, it is dissolved together with its products. And it is trodden under
foot of men and beast, and receives the bloodstains of the slain; and it is dug open, and filled
with the dead, and becomes a tomb for corpses. But it is impossible that a nature, which is
holy and worthy and blessed and immortal, should allow of anyone of these things. And
hence it appears to us that the earth is not a god but a creation of God.</p>
<p>V. In the same way, again, those erred who believed the waters to be gods. For the
waters were created for the use of man, and are put under his rule in many ways. For they
suffer change and admit impurity, and are destroyed and lose their nature while they are
boiled into many substances. And they take colours which do not belong to them; they are
also congealed by frost and are mingled and permeated with the filth of men and beasts,
and with the blood of the slain. And being checked by skilled workmen through the restraint
of aqueducts, they flow and are diverted against their inclination, and come into gardens
and other places in order that they may be collected and issue forth as a means of fertility
for man, and that they may cleanse away every impurity and fulfil the service man requires
from them. Wherefore it is impossible that the waters should be a god, but they are a work
of God and a part of the world.</p>
<p>In like manner also they who believed that fire is a god erred to no slight extent. For it,
too, was created for the service of men, and is subject to them in many ways:—in the preparation
of meat, and as a means of casting metals, and for other ends whereof your Majesty
is aware. At the same time it is quenched and extinguished in many ways.</p>
<p>Again they also erred who believed the motion of the winds to be a god. For it is well
known to us that those winds are under the dominion of another, at times their motion increases,
and at times it fails and ceases at the command of him who controls them. For they
were created by God for the sake of men, in order to supply the necessity of trees and fruits
and seeds; and to bring over the sea ships which convey for men necessaries and goods from
places where they are found to places where they are not found; and to govern the quarters
of the world. And as for itself, at times it increases and again abates; and in one place brings
help and in another causes disaster at the bidding of him who rules it. And mankind too
are able by known means to confine and keep it in check in order that it may fulfil for them
the service they require from it. And of itself it has not any authority at all. And hence it
is impossible that the winds should be called gods, but rather a thing made by God.</p>

<pb n="514"/>
<p>VI. So also they erred who believed that the sun is a god. For we see that it is moved
by the compulsion of another, and revolves and makes its journey, and proceeds from sign
to sign, rising and setting every day, so as to give warmth for the growth of plants and trees,
and to bring forth into the air where with it (sunlight) is mingled every growing thing which
is upon the earth. And to it there belongs by comparison a part in common with the rest
of the stars in its course; and though it is one in its nature it is associated with many parts
for the supply of the needs of men; and that not according to its own will but rather according
to the will of him who rules it. And hence it is impossible that the sun should be a god, but
the work of God; and in like manner also the moon and the stars.</p>
<p>VII. And those who believed of the men of the past, that some of them were gods, they
too were much mistaken. For as you yourself allow, O King, man is constituted of the four
elements and of a soul and a spirit (and hence he is called a microcosm),4432 and without
anyone of these parts he could not consist. He has a beginning and an end, and he is born
and dies. But God, as I said, has none of these things in his nature, but is uncreated and
imperishable. And hence it is not possible that we should set up man to be of the nature of
God:—man, to whom at times when he looks for joy, there comes trouble, and when he
looks for laughter there comes to him weeping,—who is wrathful and covetous and envious,
with other defects as well. And he is destroyed in many ways by the elements and also by
the animals.</p>
<p>And hence, O King, we are bound to recognize the error of the Barbarians, that thereby,
since they did not find traces of the true God, they fell aside from the truth, and went after
the desire of their imagination, serving the perishable elements and lifeless images, and
through their error not apprehending what the true God is.</p>
<p>VIII. Let us turn further to the Greeks also, that we may know what opinion they hold
as to the true God. The Greeks, then, because they are more subtle than the Barbarians,
have gone further astray than the Barbarians; inasmuch as they have introduced many fictitious
gods, and have set up some of them as males and some as females; and in that some
of their gods were found who were adulterers, and did murder, and were deluded, and en-
vious, and wrathful and passionate, and parricides, and thieves, and robbers. And some of
them, they say, were crippled and limped, and some were sorcerers, and some actually went
mad, and some played on lyres, and some were given to roaming on the hills, and some
even died, and some were struck dead by lightning, and some were made servants even to
men, and some escaped by flight, and some were kidnapped by men, and some, indeed,
were lamented and deplored by men. And some, they say, went down to Sheol, and some
were grievously wounded, and some transformed themselves into the likeness of animals
<note type="footnote">4432 Or “and hence the world also gets its name κόσμος.” The Syriac is the equivalent of the Greek “διὸ καὶ
κόσμος καλεῖται,” which occurs (Chap. IV.) in discussing the supposed divinity of the sky or heaven.</note>

<pb n="515"/>
to seduce the race of mortal women, and some polluted themselves4433 by lying with males.
And some, they say, were wedded to their mothers and their sisters and their daughters.
And they say of their gods that they committed adultery with the daughters of men; and of
these there was born a certain race which also was mortal. And they say that some of the
females disputed about beauty, and appeared before men for judgment. Thus, O King, have
the Greeks put forward foulness, and absurdity, and folly about their gods and about
themselves, in that they have called those that are of such a nature gods, who are no gods.
And hence mankind have received incitements to commit adultery and fornication, and to
steal and to practise all that is offensive and hated and abhorred. For if they who are called
their gods practised all these things which are written above, how much more should men
practise them—men, who believe that their gods themselves practised them. And owing to
the foulness of this error there have happened to mankind harassing wars, and great famines,
and bitter captivity, and complete desolation. And lo! it was by reason of this alone that
they suffered and that all these things came upon them; and while they endured those things
they did not perceive in their mind that for their error those things came upon them.</p>
<p>IX. Let us proceed further to their account of their gods that we may carefully demonstrate
all that is said above. First of all, the Greeks bring forward as a god Kronos, that is to
say Chiun4434 (Saturn). And his worshippers sacrifice their children to him, and they burn
some of them alive in his honour. And they say that he took to him among his wives Rhea,
and begat many children by her. By her too he begat Dios, who is called Zeus. And at length
he (Kronos) went mad, and through fear of an oracle that had been made known to him,
he began to devour his sons. And from him Zeus was stolen away without his knowledge;
and at length Zeus bound him, and mutilated the signs of his manhood, and flung them
into the sea. And hence, as they say in fable, there was engendered Aphrodite, who is called
Astarte. And he (Zeus) cast out Kronos fettered into darkness. Great then is the error and
ignominy which the Greeks have brought forward about the first of their gods, in that they
have said all this about him, O King. It is impossible that a god should be bound or mutilated;
and if it be otherwise, he is indeed miserable.</p>
<p>And after Kronos they bring forward another god Zeus. And they say of him that he
assumed the sovereignty, and was king over all the gods. And they say that he changed
himself into a beast and other shapes in order to seduce mortal women, and to raise up by
them children for himself. Once, they say, he changed himself into a bull through love of
Europe and Pasiphae.4435 And again he changed himself into the likeness of gold through
<note type="footnote">4433 Professor Nöldeke’s emendation, <gap reason="omitted"/>, in place of <gap reason="omitted"/> ="they were reviled,” is adopted in the translation
given.</note>
<note type="footnote">4434 Cf. Amos v. 26, “Chiun, your star god,” and Acts vii. 43.</note>
<note type="footnote">4435 Pasiphae’s unnatural passion for Taurus is not in the Greek mythology charged to Zeus.</note>

<pb n="516"/>
love of Danae, and to a swan through love of Leda, and to a man through love of Antiope,
and to lightning through love of Luna,4436 and so by these he begat many children. For by
Antiope, they say, that he begat Zethus and Amphion, and by Luna Dionysos, by Alcmena
Hercules, and by Leto, Apollo and Artemis, and by Danae Perseus, and by Leda, Castor and
Polydeuces, and Helene and Paludus,4437 and by Mnemosyne he begat nine daughters whom
they styled the Muses, and by Europe, Minos and Rhadamanthos and Sarpedon. And lastly
he changed himself into the likeness of an eagle through his passion for Ganydemos
(Ganymede) the shepherd.</p>
<p>By reason of these tales, O King, much evil has arisen among men, who to this day are
imitators of their gods, and practise adultery and defile themselves with their mothers and
their sisters, and by lying with males, and some make bold to slay even their parents. For
if he who is said to be the chief and king of their gods do these things how much more should
his worshippers imitate him? And great is the folly which the Greeks have brought forward
in their narrative concerning him. For it is impossible that a god should practise adultery
or fornication or come near to lie with males, or kill his parents; and if it be otherwise, he
is much worse than a destructive demon.</p>
<p>X. Again they bring forward as another god Hephaistos. And they say of him, that he
is lame, and a cap is set on his head, and he holds in his hands firetongs and a hammer; and
he follows the craft of iron working, that thereby he may procure the necessaries of his
livelihood. Is then this god so very needy? But it cannot be that a god should be needy or
lame, else he is very worthless.</p>
<p>And further they bring in another god and call him Hermes. And they say that he is a
thief,4438 a lover of avarice, and greedy for gain, and a magician and mutilated and an athlete,
and an interpreter of language. But it is impossible that a god should be a magician or avaricious,
or maimed, or craving for what is not his, or an athlete. And if it be otherwise, he is
found to be useless.</p>
<p>And after him they bring forward as another god Asklepios. And they say that he is a
physician and prepares drugs and plaster that he may supply the necessaries of his livelihood.
Is then this god in want? And at length he was struck with lightning by Dios on account of
Tyndareos of Lacedæmon, and so he died. If then Asklepios were a god, and, when he was
struck with lightning, was unable to help himself, how should he be able to give help to
others? But that a divine nature should be in want or be destroyed by lightning is impossible.</p>
<note type="footnote">4436 The visit of Zeus to Semele (not Selene) is evidently referred to. Σελήνη Luna would give the Syriac <gap reason="omitted"/>.</note>
<note type="footnote">4437 Professor Rendel Harris pronounces “Paludus” a vox nihili, and explains its presence as due to a corrupt
repetition of the preceding Polydeuces. The Syriac word in the text suggests Pollux—the Latin equivalent of
Polydeuces. Clytemnestra is the name required.</note>
<note type="footnote">4438 Adopting Professor Harris’s emendation <gap reason="omitted"/>= κλέπτης instead of <gap reason="omitted"/> = vir.</note>

<pb n="517"/>
<p>And again they bring forward another as a god, and they call him Ares. And they say
that he is a warrior, and jealous, and covets sheep and things which are not his. And he
makes gain by his arms. And they say that at length he committed adultery with Aphrodite,
and was caught by the little boy Eros and by Hephaistos the husband of Aphrodite. But it
is impossible that a god should be a warrior or bound or an adulterer.</p>
<p>And again they say of Dionysos that he forsooth! is a god, who arranges carousals by
night, and teaches drunkenness, and carries off women who do not belong to him. And at
length, they say, he went mad and dismissed his handmaidens and fled into the desert; and
during his madness he ate serpents. And at last he was killed by Titanos. If then Dionysos
were a god, and when he was being killed was unable to help himself, how is it possible that
he should help others?</p>
<p>Herakles next they bring forward and say that he is a god, who hates detestable things,
a tyrant,4439 and warrior and a destroyer of plagues. And of him also they say that at length
he became mad and killed his own children, and cast himself into a fire and died. If then
Herakles is a god, and in all these calamities was unable to rescue himself, how should others
ask help from him? But it is impossible that a god should be mad, or drunken or a slayer
of his children, or consumed by fire.</p>
<p>XI. And after him they bring forward another god and call him Apollon. And they say
that he is jealous and inconstant, and at times he holds the bow and quiver, and again the
lyre and plectron. And he utters oracles for men that he may receive rewards from them.
Is then this god in need of rewards? But it is an insult that all these things should be found
with a god.</p>
<p>And after him they bring forward as a goddess Artemis, the sister of Apollo; and they
say that she was a huntress and that she herself used to carry a bow and bolts, and to roam
about upon the mountains, leading the hounds to hunt stags or wild boars of the field. But
it is disgraceful that a virgin maid should roam alone upon the hills or hunt in the chase for
animals. Wherefore it is impossible that Artemis should be a goddess.</p>
<p>Again they say of Aphrodite that she indeed is a goddess. And at times she dwells with
their gods, but at other times she is a neighbour to men. And once she had Ares as a lover,
and again Adonis who is Tammuz. Once also, Aphrodite was wailing and weeping for the
death of Tammuz, and they say that she went down to Sheol that she might redeem Adonis
from Persephone, who is the daughter of Sheol (Hades). If then Aphrodite is a goddess and
was unable to help her lover at his death, how will she find it possible to help others? And
this cannot be listened to, that a divine nature should come to weeping and wailing and
adultery.</p>
<note type="footnote">4439 “Tyrant,” <gap reason="omitted"/>, seems out of place when connected with Herakles. Perhaps <gap reason="omitted"/> = ebrius, which occurs at
the close of the paragraph, should be read here. Cf. also the Greek.</note>

<pb n="518"/>
<p>And again they say of Tammuz that he is a god. And he is, forsooth! a hunter and an
adulterer. And they say that he was killed by a wound from a wild boar, without being able
to help himself. And if he could not help himself, how can he take thought for the human
race? But that a god should be an adulterer or a hunter or should die by violence is impossible.</p>
<p>Again they say of Rhea that she is the mother of their gods. And they say that she had
once a lover Atys, and that she used to delight in depraved men. And at last she raised a
lamentation and mourned for Atys her lover. If then the mother of their gods was unable
to help her lover and deliver him from death, how can she help others? So it is disgraceful
that a goddess should lament and weep and take delight in depraved men.</p>
<p>Again they introduce Kore and say that she is a goddess, and she was stolen away by
Pluto, and could not help herself. If then she is a goddess and was unable to help herself
how will she find means to help others? For a god who is stolen away is very powerless.</p>
<p>All this, then, O King, have the Greeks brought forward concerning their gods, and they
have invented and declared it concerning them. And hence all men received an impulse to
work all profanity and all defilements; and hereby the whole earth was corrupted.</p>
<p>XII. The Egyptians, moreover, because they are more base and stupid than every people
that is on the earth, have themselves erred more than all. For the deities (or religion) of the
Barbarians and the Greeks did not suffice for them, but they introduced some also of the
nature of the animals, and said thereof that they were gods, and likewise of creeping things
which are found on the dry land and in the waters. And of plants and herbs they said that
some of them were gods. And they were corrupted by every kind of delusion and defilement
more than every people that is on the earth. For from ancient times they worshipped Isis,
and they say that she is a goddess whose husband was Osiris her brother. And when Osiris
was killed by Typhon his brother, Isis fled with Horos her son to Byblus in Syria, and was
there for a certain time till her son was grown. And he contended with Typhon his uncle,
and killed him. And then Isis returned and went about with Horos her son and sought for
the dead body of Osiris her lord, bitterly lamenting his death. If then Isis be a goddess, and
could not help Osiris her brother and lord, how can she help another? But it is impossible
that a divine nature should be afraid, and flee for safety, or should weep and wail; or else it
is very miserable.</p>
<p>And of Osiris also they say that he is a serviceable god. And he was killed by Typhon
and was unable to help himself. But it is well known that this cannot be asserted of divinity.
And further, they say of his brother Typhon that he is a god, who killed his brother and was
killed by his brother’s son and by his bride, being unable to help himself. And how, pray,
is he a god who does not save himself ?</p>
<p>As the Egyptians, then, were more stupid than the rest of the nations, these and such
like gods did not suffice for them. Nay, but they even apply the name of gods to animals in

<pb n="519"/>
which there is no soul at all. For some of them worship the sheep and others the calf; and
some the pig and others the shad fish; and some the crocodile and the hawk and the fish
and the ibis and the vulture and the eagle and the raven. Some of them worship the cat, and
others the turbotfish, some the dog, some the adder, and some the asp, and others the lion;
and others the garlic and onions and thorns, and others the tiger and other such things.
And the poor creatures do not see that all these things are nothing, although they daily
witness their gods being eaten and consumed by men and also by their fellows; while some
of them are cremated, and some die and decay and become dust, without their observing
that they perish in many ways. So the Egyptians have not observed that such things which
are not equal to their own deliverance, are not gods. And if, forsooth, they are weak in the
case of their own deliverance, whence have they power to help in the case of deliverance of
their worshippers? Great then is the error into which the Egyptians wandered;—greater,
indeed, than that of any people which is upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p>XIII. But it is a marvel, O King, with regard to the Greeks, who surpass all other peoples
in their manner of life and reasoning, how they have gone astray after dead idols and lifeless
images. And yet they see their gods in the hands of their artificers being sawn out, and
planed and docked, and hacked short, and charred, and ornamented, and being altered by
them in every kind of way. And when they grow old, and are worn away through lapse of
time, and when they are molten and crushed to powder, how, I wonder, did they not perceive
concerning them, that they are not gods? And as for those who did not find deliverance for
themselves, how can they serve the distress of men?</p>
<p>But even the writers and philosophers among them have wrongly alleged that the gods
are such as are made in honour of God Almighty. And they err in seeking to liken (them)
to God whom man has not at any time seen nor can see unto what He is like. Herein, too
(they err) in asserting of deity that any such thing as deficiency can be present to it; as when
they say that He receives sacrifice and requires burnt-offering and libation and immolations
of men, and temples. But God is not in need, and none of these things is necessary to Him;
and it is clear that men err in these things they imagine.</p>
<p>Further their writers and their philosophers represent and declare that the nature of all
their gods is one. And they have not apprehended God our Lord who while He is one, is
in all. They err therefore. For if the body of a man while it is many in its parts is not in
dread, one member of another, but, since it is a united body, wholly agrees with itself; even
so also God is one in His nature. A single essence is proper to Him, since He is uniform in
His nature and His essence; and He is not afraid of Himself. If then the nature of the gods
is one, it is not proper that a god should either pursue or slay or harm a god. If, then, gods
be pursued and wounded by gods, and some be kidnapped and some struck dead by lightning,
it is obvious that the nature of their gods is not one. And hence it is known, O King, that

<pb n="520"/>
it is a mistake when they reckon and bring the natures of their gods under a single nature.
If then it becomes us to admire a god which is seen and does not see, how much more
praiseworthy is it that one should believe in a nature which is invisible and all-seeing? And
if further it is fitting that one should approve the handiworks of a craftsman, how much
more is it fitting that one should glorify the Creator of the craftsman?</p>
<p>For behold! when the Greeks made laws they did not perceive that by their laws they
condemn their gods. For if their laws are righteous, their gods are unrighteous, since they
transgressed the law in killing one another, and practising sorcery, and committing adultery,
and in robbing and stealing, and in lying with males, and by their other practises as well.
For if their gods were right in doing all these things as they are described, then the laws of
the Greeks are unrighteous in not being made according to the will of their gods. And in
that case the whole world is gone astray.</p>
<p>For the narratives about their gods are some of them myths, and some of them naturepoems
(lit: natural:—φυσικαί), and some of them hymns and elegies. The hymns indeed
and elegies are empty words and noise. But these nature-poems, even if they be made as
they say, still those are not gods who do such things and suffer and endure such things.
And those myths are shallow tales with no depth whatever in them.</p>
<p>XIV. Let us come now, O King, to the history of the Jews also, and see what opinion
they have as to God. The Jews then say that God is one, the Creator of all, and omnipotent;
and that it is not right that any other should be worshipped except this God alone. And
herein they appear to approach the truth more than all the nations, especially in that they
worship God and not His works. And they imitate God by the philanthropy which prevails
among them; for they have compassion on the poor, and they release the captives, and bury
the dead, and do such things as these, which are acceptable before God and well-pleasing
also to men,—which (customs) they have received from their forefathers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they too erred from true knowledge. And in their imagination they conceive
that it is God they serve; whereas by their mode of observance it is to the angels and not to
God that their service is rendered:—as when they celebrate sabbaths and the beginning of
the months, and feasts of unleavened bread, and a great fast; and fasting and circumcision
and the purification of meats, which things, however, they do not observe perfectly.</p>
<p>XV. But the Christians, O King, while they went about and made search,4440 have found
the truth; and as we learned from their writings, they have come nearer to truth and genuine
knowledge than the rest of the nations. For they know and trust in God, the Creator of
heaven and of earth, in whom and from whom are all things, to whom there is no other god
as companion, from whom they received commandments which they engraved upon their
minds and observe in hope and expectation of the world which is to come. Wherefore they
<note type="footnote">4440 The same two words are used of Isis. The Christians are unlike her in finding what they sought.</note>

<pb n="521"/>
do not commit adultery nor fornication, nor bear false witness, nor embezzle what is held
in pledge, nor covet what is not theirs. They honour father and mother, and show kindness
to those near to them; and whenever they are judges, they judge uprightly. They do not
worship idols (made) in the image of man; and whatsoever they would not that others should
do unto them, they do not to others; and of the food which is consecrated to idols they do
not eat, for they are pure. And their oppressors they appease (lit: comfort) and make them
their friends; they do good to their enemies; and their women, O King, are pure as virgins,
and their daughters are modest; and their men keep themselves from every unlawful union
and from all uncleanness, in the hope of a recompense to come in the other world. Further,
if one or other of them have bondmen and bondwomen or children, through love towards
them they persuade them to become Christians, and when they have done so, they call them
brethren without distinction. They do not worship strange gods, and they go their way in
all modesty and cheerfulness. Falsehood is not found among them; and they love one another,
and from widows they do not turn away their esteem; and they deliver the orphan
from him who treats him harshly. And he, who has, gives to him who has not, without
boasting. And when they see a stranger, they take him in to their homes and rejoice over
him as a very brother; for they do not call them brethren after the flesh, but brethren after
the spirit and in God. And whenever one of their poor passes from the world, each one of
them according to his ability gives heed to him and carefully sees to his burial. And if they
hear that one of their number is imprisoned or afflicted on account of the name of their
Messiah, all of them anxiously minister to his necessity, and if it is possible to redeem him
they set him free. And if there is among them any that is poor and needy, and if they have
no spare food, they fast two or three days in order to supply to the needy their lack of food.
They observe the precepts of their Messiah with much care, living justly and soberly as the
Lord their God commanded them. Every morning4441 and every hour they give thanks and
praise to God for His loving-kindnesses toward them; and for their food and their drink
they offer thanksgiving to Him. And if any righteous man among them passes from the
world, they rejoice and offer thanks to God; and they escort his body as if he were setting
out from one place to another near. And when a child has been born to one of them, they
give thanks to God; and if moreover it happen to die in childhood, they give thanks to God
the more, as for one who has passed through the world without sins. And further if they
see that anyone of them dies in his ungodliness or in his sins, for him they grieve bitterly,
and sorrow as for one who goes to meet his doom.</p>
<p>XVI. Such, O King, is the commandment of the law of the Christians, and such is their
manner of life. As men who know God, they ask from Him petitions which are fitting for
<note type="footnote">4441 Cf. Pliny’s letter to the Emperor Trajan, a.d. 112, “The Christians are wont to meet at dawn on an appointed
day, and to sing a hymn to Christ as God.”</note>

<pb n="522"/>
Him to grant and for them to receive. And thus they employ their whole lifetime. And
since they know the loving-kindnesses of God toward them, behold! for their sake the
glorious things which are in the world flow forth to view. And verily, they are those who
found the truth when they went about and made search for it; and from what we considered,
we learned that they alone come near to a knowledge of the truth. And they do not proclaim
in the ears of the multitude the kind deeds they do, but are careful that no one should notice
them; and they conceal their giving just as he who finds a treasure and conceals it. And
they strive to be righteous as those who expect to behold their Messiah, and to receive from
Him with great glory the promises made concerning them. And as for their words and their
precepts, O King, and their glorying in their worship, and the hope of earning according to
the work of each one of them their recompense which they look for in another world, you
may learn about these from their writings. It is enough for us to have shortly informed your
Majesty concerning the conduct and the truth of the Christians. For great indeed, and
wonderful is their doctrine to him who will search into it and reflect upon it. And verily,
this is a new people, and there is something divine (lit: a divine admixture) in the midst of
them.</p>
<p>Take, then, their writings, and read therein, and lo! you will find that I have not put
forth these things on my own authority, nor spoken thus as their advocate; but since I read
in their writings I was fully assured of these things as also of things which are to come. And
for this reason I was constrained to declare the truth to such as care for it and seek the world
to come. And to me there is no doubt but that the earth abides through the supplication of
the Christians. But the rest of the nations err and cause error in wallowing before the elements
of the world, since beyond these their mental vision will not pass. And they search
about as if in darkness because they will not recognize the truth; and like drunken men they
reel and jostle one another and fall.</p>
<p>XVII. Thus far, O King, I have spoken; for concerning that which remains, as is said
above,4442 there are found in their other writings things which are hard to utter and difficult
for one to narrate,—which are not only spoken in words but also wrought out in deeds.</p>
<p>Now the Greeks, O King, as they follow base practises in intercourse with males, and a
mother and a sister and a daughter, impute their monstrous impurity in turn to the Christians.
But the Christians are just and good, and the truth is set before their eyes, and their
spirit is long-suffering; and, therefore, though they know the error of these (the Greeks),
and are persecuted by them, they bear and endure it; and for the most part they have compassion
on them, as men who are destitute of knowledge. And on their side, they offer
prayer that these may repent of their error; and when it happens that one of them has repen-

ted, he is ashamed before the Christians of the works which were done by him; and he makes
confession to God, saying, I did these things in ignorance. And he purifies his heart, and
his sins are forgiven him, because he committed them in ignorance in the former time, when
he used to blaspheme and speak evil of the true knowledge of the Christians. And assuredly
the race of the Christians is more blessed than all the men who are upon the face of the
earth.</p>
<p>Henceforth let the tongues of those who utter vanity and harass the Christians be silent;
and hereafter let them speak the truth. For it is of serious consequence to them that they
should worship the true God rather than worship a senseless sound. And verily whatever
is spoken in the mouth of the Christians is of God; and their doctrine is the gateway of light.
Wherefore let all who are without the knowledge of God draw near thereto; and they will
receive incorruptible words, which are from all time and from eternity. So shall they appear
before the awful judgment which through Jesus the Messiah is destined to come upon the
whole human race.</p>

<head>THE PASSION OF THE SCILLITAN MARTYRS.

<head>The Passion of the Scillitan Martyrs.</head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>The Scillitan Martyrs were condemned and executed at Carthage on the 17th July, a.d.
180. The martyrs belonged to Scili, a place in that part of Numidia which belonged to proconsular
Africa. The proconsul at the time, who is said by Tertullian to have been the first
to draw the sword against the Christians there, was P. Vigellius Saturninus. The consuls
for the year were Præsens II. and Condianus. Marcus Aurelius had died only a few months
before.</p>
<p>The exact date of the martyrdom was long under dispute, and the question has recently
arisen whether the Acts were originally written in Latin or Greek. Baronius placed the date
as late as 202. The text had become corrupt in passing through various Latin and Greek
versions and transcriptions, and it was long impossible to recognize the names of the consuls
for the year in the first line of the piece. But M. Leon Renier conjectured that the word bis
pointed to a consul’s name underlying the word preceding it, and suggested the year 180,
when Præsens and Condianus were consuls. This conjecture was confirmed by Usener’s
publication in 1881 of a Greek version from a ninth century ms. in the Bibliothèque Nationale
at Paris, though even here the names, though recognizable, were in a corrupt form. Usener
believed this version to be a translation from a Latin original, and his theory has been confirmed
by Mr. Armitage Robinson’s discovery of a Latin ms. of the ninth century in the
British Museum, containing the Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs in a form briefer than any of
the other versions and believed to be the original. Mr. A. Robinson’s translation which
follows, is from the Latin which he discovered, and which is printed in Texts and Studies,
vol. i., No. 2.</p>

<p>When Præsens, for the second time, and Claudianus were the consuls, on the seventeenth
day of July, at Carthage, there were set in the judgment-hall Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus,
Donata, Secunda and Vestia.</p>
<p>Saturninus the proconsul said: Ye can win the indulgence of our lord the Emperor, if
ye return to a sound mind.</p>
<p>Speratus said: We have never done ill, we have not lent ourselves to wrong, we have
never spoken ill, but when ill-treated we have given thanks; because we pay heed to our
Emperor.</p>
<p>Saturninus the proconsul said: We too are religious, and our religion is simple, and we
swear by the genius of our lord the Emperor, and pray for his welfare, as ye also ought to
do.</p>
<p>Speratus said: If thou wilt peaceably lend me thine ears, I can tell thee the mystery of
simplicity.</p>
<p>Saturninus said: I will not lend mine ears to thee, when thou beginnest to speak evil
things of our sacred rites; but rather swear thou by the genius of our lord the Emperor.</p>
<p>Speratus said: The empire of this world I know not; but rather I serve that God, whom
no man hath seen, nor with these eyes can see.4443 I have committed no theft; but if I have
bought anything I pay the tax; because I know my Lord, the King of kings and Emperor of
all nations.</p>
<p>Saturninus the proconsul said to the rest: Cease to be of this persuasion.</p>
<p>Speratus said: It is an ill persuasion to do murder, to speak false witness.</p>
<p>Saturninus the proconsul said: Be not partakers of this folly.</p>
<p>Cittinus said: We have none other to fear, save only our Lord God, who is in heaven.</p>
<p>Donata said: Honour to Cæsar as Cæsar: but fear to God.4444</p>
<p>Vestia said: I am a Christian.</p>
<p>Secunda said: What I am, that I wish to be.</p>
<p>Saturninus the proconsul said to Speratus: Dost thou persist in being a Christian?</p>
<p>Speratus said: I am a Christian. And with him they all agreed.</p>
<p>Saturninus the proconsul said: Will ye have a space to consider?</p>
<p>Speratus said: In a matter so straightforward there is no considering.</p>
<p>Saturninus the proconsul said: What are the things in your chest?</p>
<p>Speratus said: Books and epistles of Paul, a just man.</p>

<p>Saturninus the proconsul said: Have a delay of thirty days and bethink yourselves.</p>
<p>Speratus said a second time: I am a Christian. And with him they all agreed.</p>
<p>Saturninus the proconsul read out the decree from the tablet: Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus,
Donata, Vestia, Secunda and the rest having confessed that they live according to the
Christian rite, since after opportunity offered them of returning to the custom of the Romans
they have obstinately persisted, it is determined that they be put to the sword.</p>

AND
ORIGEN’S COMMENTARY
ON THE

<head>Commentaries of Origen. </head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>For a general account of Origen and of his works we may refer to Dr. Crombie’s Life of
Origen, in vol. iv. of this series (xxiii. in Clark’s issue). The principal facts of his career are
as follows: He was born of Christian parents at Alexandria about the year 185 a.d., and from
his earliest youth devoted himself to the study of Scripture in such a way as to suggest that
he was destined for a great career. His father suffered martyrdom in the year 202, and Origen
very soon afterwards succeeded the great Clement as head of the school at Alexandria.
Thirteen years after, the persecution of Caracalla drove him from his own country to Cæsarea,
where though still a layman he preached at church meetings. Recalled to Alexandria, he
laboured there for fifteen years further as teacher and author, till in the year 231 his ordination
at Cæsarea to the office of presbyter drew upon him the condemnation of the bishop
of Alexandria and became the occasion of his permanent withdrawal from the place of his
birth. At Cæsarea he now formed a new school of Christian training similar to that from
which he had been driven. At this time, as well as in the earlier period of his life, he made
various journeys to different parts of the world. His death was brought about by sufferings
inflicted on him in the persecution of Decius, and took place at Tyre, probably in the year
254.</p>
<p>Part of the Commentary on John, the first great work of Christian interpretation, and
part of that on Matthew, written by the father at a later period of his life, are here presented
to the reader; and a few words of introduction may be added on Origen’s work as an expositor
and on these two works in particular.</p>
<p>Though Origen was the first great interpreter of Scripture in the Church, commentaries
had been written before his. He speaks of those who had preceded him in this activity; and
though but little survives of the labours of these earlier expositors, we know that the work
of commenting on Scripture was zealously carried on in the Gnostic churches in the latter
part of the second century, and several of the older exegetes in the Church are also known
to us by name and reputation. Heracleon the Gnostic commentator on John, who is often
cited and often rather unfairly dealt with by Origen, as he follows him over the same ground,
belonged to the Valentinian school. Many of his comments the reader will find to be very
just and shrewd; but the tenets of his school led him into many extravagances. Of Pantænus,
head of the catechetical school at Alexandria in the end of the second and early years of the
third century, we hear that he interpreted many of the books of Scripture. We also learn

<pb n="530"/>
that he preceded Clement and Origen, his successors in office, in the application of Gentile
learning to Christian studies; the broad and liberal tone of Alexandrian theology may be
due in part to his influence. Much of his exegetical work was still extant in the days of
Jerome, who, however, reports that he did more for the Church as a teacher than as a writer.
Only fragments of his Commentaries now remain. In Clement’s works, on the contrary,
we find, if not any set commentaries, various extended discussions of particular texts. We
also find in him a theory of Scripture, its inspiration and its nature, which is followed also
by Origen, and which determines the whole character of Alexandrian exegesis. In accordance
with the general tendency of that age, which witnessed a reaction from the independence
of philosophy and an appeal in many quarters to the authority of ancient oracles and writings,
the Alexandrian school treats Scripture as an inspired and infallible storehouse of truth,—of
truth, however, not patent to the simple reader, but requiring the spiritual man to discern
its mystic import. Clement discusses the question why divine things are wrapped up in
mysteries, and holds that all who have spoken of such things have dealt with them in this
way. Everything in Scripture, therefore, has a mystical in addition to its obvious meaning.
Every minute particular about the tabernacle and its furniture is charged with an unseen
truth. The effect of such a view of Scripture on exegesis is necessarily that the interpreter
finds in the inspired words not what they plainly convey, but what most interests his own
mind. In assigning to each verse its spiritual meaning, he is neither guided nor restrained
by any rule or system, but enjoys complete liberty. The natural good sense of these great
scholars curbed to some extent the licence of their theory; but with such a view of Scripture
they could not but run into many an extravagance; and the allegorical method of interpretation,
which so long prevailed in Christendom and is still practised in some quarters, dates
from Alexandria. The roots of it lie further back, in Jewish rabbinical treatment of the Old
Testament, and in the Greek philosophy of Alexandria. In Philo, the great contemporary
of Christ at Alexandria, rabbinical and Greek learning met, and Scripture being a divine
authority and having to furnish evidence of Greek philosophical doctrines, the allegorical
method of interpretation was called to perform large services. To Philo’s eyes all wisdom
was contained in the Pentateuch, and many an idea of which Moses never dreamed had to
be extracted from that ancient record. The method was older than Clement and Origen,
but it was through them that it became so firmly established in the Church.</p>
<p>In Origen we first find a great teacher who deliberately sets himself to the task of explaining
Scripture. He became, at the early age of eighteen, the head of the catechetical school
at Alexandria, an institution which not only trained catechumens but provided open lectures,
on every part of Christian learning, and from that time to his death, at the age of sixty-nine,
he was constantly engaged in the work of public exposition. At Alexandria his expositions
took place in the school, but at Cæsarea they formed part of the church services, so that the
reports of those belonging to the Cæsarean period provide us with the earliest examples we

<pb n="531"/>
possess of the discourse at Christian meetings. In an activity which he practised so much
Origen acquired extraordinary skill and facility, and gained the highest reputation, even
beyond the limits of the Church. It is no wonder, therefore, if he succeeded in treating
nearly the whole Bible in this way, a thing which might no doubt be said of many a Christian
teacher since his day; for he was not one who was apt to repeat himself, but was constantly
pressing on to break new ground.</p>
<p>But the reported homilies form only a part—and that not the most important part—of
his exegetical works. What he gave in his homilies was necessarily designed for edification;
it had to be plain enough to be understood by a mixed audience, and serviceable to their
needs. Origen believed, however, that there was very much in Scripture that lay beyond the
capacity of the ordinary mind, and that the highest way of treating Scripture was not that
of practical application, but that of searching after its hidden sense. In the fourth book of
his De Principiis (vol. x. of Clark’s set) he sets forth his views about the Scriptures. “As
man,” he there says, “consists of body, soul, and spirit, so in the same way does Scripture,
which has been arranged to be given by God for the salvation of man.” Scripture, therefore,
has three senses, the bodily (somatic) or the obvious matter-of-fact sense, the psychical or
moral sense, which serves for edification of the pious, and, highest of all, the spiritual sense.
For this latter sense of Scripture Origen has many names,—as many as forty have been
counted,—he calls it the heavenly sense, the intellectual, the anagogical, the mystic, the
hidden. This is what chiefly engages his interest in the work of expounding. Scripture is
to him full of mysteries, every jot and tittle has its secret, and to read these heavenly mysteries
is the highest object of the interpreter. In addition, therefore, to his oral expositions (ὁμιλίαι)
and the short notes (σημειώσεις) which are generally reckoned as a third class of his exegetical
works, we have the written commentaries, books, or τόμοι of Origen, in which he discusses
Scripture without being hampered by the requirements of edification, according to
the method which alone he recognizes as adequate. He was enabled to devote himself to
this labour by the generosity of a rich friend, Ambrosius, who urged him to undertake it,
and provided funds for the payment of shorthand writers and copyists. We are told that
seven of the former were at one time placed at his disposal. The work which he was thus
led to undertake Origen felt to be very responsible and burdensome; it was not to be approached
without fervent prayer, and he sometimes complains that it is too much for him,
and that it is only the urgent commands of Ambrosius that make him go on with it. (See
the opening chapters of the various books on John.)</p>
<p>What has been said will to some extent explain the nature of these commentaries, parts
of which are now for the first time presented to the English reader. There is a side of them,
however, of which we have not yet spoken. Origen was a great scholar as well as a great
theologian; and he thought it right, as the reader may see from the letter to Gregory also
here given, that scholarship should contribute all it could to the study of Scripture. Of his

<pb n="532"/>
multifarious knowledge and of his easy command of all the science and philosophy of his
day, the reader may judge for himself even from what is now presented to him. His work
on the words of Scripture has a value quite independently of his theological views. Some
of the most important qualifications of the worthy interpreter of Scripture he possesses in
a supreme degree. His knowledge of Scripture is extraordinary both for its range and its
minute accuracy. He had no concordance to help him; but he was himself a concordance.
Whatever word occurs he is able to bring from every part of Scripture the passages in which
it is used. He quotes passages, it is true, which are only verbally connected with the text
before him and have no affinity of idea; the wealth of illustration he has at his command
does not always assist, but sometimes, as the reader will see, impedes his progress: yet the
wonder is not diminished of such a knowledge of all parts of the Bible as is probably without
parallel. It has to be added that he is strong in grammar, and has a true eye for the real
meaning of his text; the discussions in which he does this often leave nothing to be desired.
In defining his terms he often goes far astray; he has to define them according to the science
of his day; but he is not guilty of loose construction of sentences. Another matter in which
he is distinguished is that of textual criticism. He is the first great textual critic of the Church.
That his name occurs more frequently than that of any other father in the digests of early
readings of the text of the New Testament, is due no doubt to the fact that he is the earliest
writer of commentaries which have been preserved; his commentaries contain complete
texts of the portions of Scripture commented on, as well as copious quotations from other
parts of Scripture. But he was keenly interested in the text of the New Testament for its
own sake. He tells us that many variations already existed in his day in different copies.
And he preserves many readings which afterwards disappeared from the Bible. It has also
to be said that he often quotes the same text differently in different passages, so that it appears
probable that he used several copies of the N.T. books, and that these copies differed from
each other. If, therefore, as Tischendorf suggests, Origen made a collation of the various
texts of the N.T. with which he was acquainted, as he did with his texts of the O.T. in his
Hexapla, he had no strong views as to which text was to be followed. He sometimes expresses
an opinion as to which is the true reading (pp. 368 sq.), but he does so on grounds which
the textual critics of the present day could not approve.</p>
<p>It may be stated here that the translators of Origen in this volume have sought to represent
their author’s critical position with regard to Scripture by translating his Scripture
quotations from his text. As he used the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, many of
his quotations from that part of Scripture appear in a form unfamiliar to the English reader.
In the New Testament, also, his text is also very different from that which afterwards prevailed
in the Church.</p>
<p>The weakness of Origen as an interpreter is his want of historical feeling or of any conception
of such a thing as growth or development in revelation. His mind slips incessantly

<pb n="533"/>
away from the real scenes and events recorded in Scripture, to the ideal region where he
conceives that the truths reside which these prefigure. Scripture is to him not a record of
actual occurrences which took place as they are narrated, but a storehouse of types of
heavenly things, which alone are real. He scoffs at the notion that historical facts should be
regarded as the chief outcome of a Scripture narrative (John, book x. 15–17, pp. 389–394).
When he does treat the facts as facts he has many a shrewd observation and many a beautiful
application. But the facts are to a large extent in his way; they have to give place to something
more important. He sees very well how the synoptic narratives clash with that of John; no
better demonstration of this need be looked for than he gives in the tenth book of his John;
from this, however, he infers not that the books must have had different sources of information,
but that the literal meaning of the passages must be altogether disregarded, and their
true purport looked for, not in the things of history, but in the things of the Spirit. The
water-pots at the feast in Cana (De Principiis), the shoe latchet of the Saviour (John, book
vi. 17), the ass and foal (John, book x. 18), each must receive a transcendent application.</p>
<p>It follows from this that the commentaries are deficient in order and sequence. The
method which calls the writer to look at every step for spiritual meanings, combined with
his own extraordinary fertility of imagination and wealth of matter, makes these books very
disconnected. At each point a number of questions suggests itself as to possible meanings;
a host of texts is brought at once from every part of Scripture to afford illustration, and these
again have to be considered. Very modestly are the questions and themes introduced. The
tone is as far as possible from being ex cathedra; it is rather that of a student groping his
way, and asking at each step for assistance. And the great mass of the questions thus raised
is left, apparently, unanswered. So that the work as a whole is rather a great collection of
materials for future consideration than a finished treatise.</p>
<p>Such being the characteristics of Origen’s commentaries, they have by many been regarded
as unsuitable for the general reader, and unfavourably compared with those of later
writers, to whom the interpretation of Scripture was not weighted with such difficulties as
Origen had to contend with. Our author does not carry us along in his commentaries with
a stream of golden eloquence; his interests are intellectual more than literary or practical,
his work is scientific rather than popular. Perhaps the historical student has more to gain
from them than the preacher. But among the pages which witness chiefly to restless intellectual
energy and unwearied diligence, there are also many passages of rare and touching
beauty, when the writer realizes the greatness of the Christian salvation, or when the heavenly
things to the search for which all his labour is devoted shine by their own brightness on his
sight.</p>
<p>The Commentaries on John are the earliest work of Christian exegesis which has come
down to us, and are therefore placed in this volume before those on Matthew. The first five
books on John were written at Alexandria before Origen’s compulsory withdrawal from

<pb n="534"/>
that city to Cæsarea in 231. In chaps. 4 and 8 of the first book he speaks of this work as being
the first fruits of his activity as a writer on Holy Scripture. The sixth book, as he tells us in
vi. 1, had been begun at Alexandria, but the manuscript had been left behind, so that a new
beginning had to be made at Cæsarea. The work was again interrupted by the persecution
of Maximian in 238; the volumes from the twenty-second to the last were written after that
date. At the end of the thirty-second volume, which is the last we now possess, the writer
has only reached John xiii. 33, but he tells us in his Commentary on Matthew that he has
spoken of the two thieves in his work on John. In the time of Eusebius only twenty-two
books survived out of the whole number, which seems to have been thirty-nine. We now
possess books i., ii., vi., x., xiii., xix., xx., xxviii., xxxii., some of which, however, are not
complete, and a few fragments. The thirteenth book begins in the middle of the story of
the Samaritan woman. Ambrosius had wished that story to be completed in the twelfth
book, but Origen did not like to make his books too long, and on this point disregarded the
authority of his mentor. The nineteenth and twentieth books are both occupied with the
eighth chapter of John, which, if it was all treated on the same scale, must have occupied
two more books in addition to these. The thirty-second book scarcely completes the thirteenth
chapter of the Gospel; and if the remaining chapters only occupied seven books, the
treatment of these must have been much more condensed.</p>
<p>Two Latin translations of Origen’s John were made in the sixteenth century, one by
Ambrosius Ferrarius of Milan from the Venice Codex, the other by Joachim Perionius.</p>
<p>The Commentaries on John and on Matthew are both embraced in several manuscripts.
Of those on John, Mr. A. E. Brooke (Texts and Studies, vol. i. No. 4; The Fragments of Heracleon,
pp. 1–30; “the mss. of Origen’s Commentaries on S. John”) enumerates eight or
nine. The Munich ms. of the thirteenth century is the source of all the rest. Huet, the first
editor (1668), used the Codex Regius (Paris) of the sixteenth century, which is in many
passages mutilated and disfigured. The brothers Delarue (1733–1759) used the mss.
Barberinus and Bodleianus, which are more complete, and Lommatzsch (1831) follows his
predecessors. The present translations are from the text of Lommatzsch, which is in many
places very defective.4445</p>
<note type="footnote">4445 Mr. Brooke’s revised text of the Commentary of Origen on St. John’s Gospel (2 vols., Cambridge University

<head>Letter of Origen to Gregory.</head>
<p>When and to whom the Learning derived from Philosophy may be of Service for the Exposition
of the Holy Scriptures; with a lively Personal Appeal.</p>
<p>This letter to Gregory, afterwards bishop of Cæsarea, and called Thaumaturgus, was
preserved in the Philocalia, or collection of extracts from Origen’s works drawn up by
Gregory of Nyssa and Basil of Cæsarea. It is printed by Delarue and Lommatzsch in the
forefront of their editions of the works. It forms a good preface to the commentaries, as it
shows how Origen considered the study of Scripture to be the highest of all studies, and
how he regarded scientific learning, in which he was himself a master, as merely preparatory
for this supreme learning. Dräseke4446 has shown that it was written about 235, when Origen,
after having had Gregory as his pupil at Cæsarea for some years, had fled before the persecution
under Maximinus Thrax to Cappadocia; while Gregory, to judge from the tenor of
this Epistle, had gone to Egypt. The Panegyric on Origen,4447 pronounced by Gregory at
Cæsarea about 239, when the school had reassembled there after the persecution, shows
that the master’s solicitude for his pupil’s true advancement was not disappointed.</p>

would wish that you should take with you on the one hand those parts of the philosophy of
the Greeks which are fit, as it were, to serve as general or preparatory studies for Christianity,
and on the other hand so much of Geometry and Astronomy as may be helpful for the interpretation
of the Holy Scriptures. The children of the philosophers speak of geometry
and music and grammar and rhetoric and astronomy as being ancillary to philosophy; and
in the same way we might speak of philosophy itself as being ancillary to Christianity.</p>

<p>It is something of this sort perhaps that is enigmatically indicated in the directions God
is represented in the Book of Exodus4448 as giving to the children of Israel. They are directed
to beg from their neighbours and from those dwelling in their tents vessels of silver and of
gold, and raiment; thus they are to spoil the Egyptians, and to obtain materials for making
the things they are told to provide in connection with the worship of God. For out of the
things of which the children of Israel spoiled the Egyptians the furniture of the Holy of
Holies was made, the ark with its cover, and the cherubim and the mercy-seat and the gold
jar in which the manna, that bread of angels, was stored. These probably were made from
the finest of the gold of the Egyptians, and from a second quality, perhaps, the solid golden
candlestick which stood near the inner veil, and the lamps on it, and the golden table on
which stood the shewbread, and between these two the golden altar of incense. And if there
was gold of a third and of a fourth quality, the sacred vessels were made of it. And of the
Egyptian silver, too, other things were made; for it was from their sojourn in Egypt that the
children of Israel derived the great advantage of being supplied with such a quantity of
precious materials for the use of the service of God. Out of the Egyptian raiment probably
were made all those requisites named in Scripture in embroidered work; the embroiderers
working4449 with the wisdom of God,4450 such garments for such purposes, to produce the
hangings and the inner and outer courts. This is not a suitable opportunity to enlarge on
such a theme or to show in how many ways the children of Israel found those things useful
which they got from the Egyptians. The Egyptians had not made a proper use of them; but
the Hebrews used them, for the wisdom of God was with them, for religious purposes. Holy
Scripture knows, however, that it was an evil thing to descend from the land of the children
of Israel into Egypt; and in this a great truth is wrapped up. For some it is of evil that they
should dwell with the Egyptians, that is to say, with the learning of the world, after they have
been enrolled in the law of God and in the Israelite worship of Him. Ader the Edomite,4451
as long as he was in the land of Israel and did not taste the bread of the Egyptians, made no
idols; but when he fled from the wise Solomon and went down into Egypt, as one who had
fled from the wisdom of God he became connected with Pharaoh, marrying the sister of his
wife, and begetting a son who was brought up among the sons of Pharaoh. Therefore,
though he did go back to the land of Israel, he came back to it to bring division into the
people of God, and to cause them to say to the golden calf, “These are thy gods, O Israel,
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.” I have learned by experience and can tell
you that there are few who have taken of the useful things of Egypt and come out of it, and

have then prepared what is required for the service of God; but Ader the Edomite on the
other hand has many a brother. I mean those who, founding on some piece of Greek
learning, have brought forth heretical ideas, and have as it were made golden calves in
Bethel, which is, being interpreted, the house of God. This appears to me to be intended to
convey that such persons set up their own images in the Scriptures in which the Word of
God dwells, and which therefore are tropically called Bethel. The other image is said in the
word to have been set up in Dan. Now the borders of Dan are at the extremities and are
contiguous to the country of the heathens, as is plainly recorded in the Book of Jesus, son
of Nave. Some of these images, then, are close to the borders of the heathen, which the
brothers, as we showed, of Ader have devised.</p>

<head>3. Personal Appeal.</head>
<p>Do you then, sir, my son, study first of all the divine Scriptures. Study them I say. For
we require to study the divine writings deeply, lest we should speak of them faster than we
think; and while you study these divine works with a believing and God-pleasing intention,
knock at that which is closed in them, and it shall be opened to thee by the porter, of whom
Jesus says,4452 “To him the porter openeth.” While you attend to this divine reading seek
aright and with unwavering faith in God the hidden sense which is present in most passages
of the divine Scriptures. And do not be content with knocking and seeking, for what is most
necessary for understanding divine things is prayer, and in urging us to this the Saviour
says not only,4453 “Knock, and it shall be opened to you,” and “Seek, and ye shall find,” but
also “Ask, and it shall be given you.” So much I have ventured on account of my fatherly
love to you. Whether I have ventured well or not, God knows, and His Christ, and he who
has part of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ. May you partake in these; may you
have an always increasing share of them, so that you may be able to say not only, “We are
partakers of Christ,”4454 but also “We are partakers of God.”</p>

<head>1. How Christians are the Spiritual Israel.</head>
<p>That people which was called of old the people of God was divided into twelve tribes,
and over and above the other tribes it had the levitical order, which itself again carried on
the service of God in various priestly and levitical suborders. In the same manner, it appears
to me that the whole people of Christ, when we regard it in the aspect of the hidden man of
the heart,4455 that people which is called “Jew inwardly,” and is circumcised in the spirit,
has in a more mystic way the characteristics of the tribes. This may be more plainly gathered
from John in his Apocalyse, though the other prophets also do not by any means conceal
the state of matters from those who have the faculty of hearing them. John speaks as follows:
4456 “And I saw another angel ascending from the sunrising, having the seal of the
living God, and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt
the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not either the earth, or the sea, or the trees, till we have
sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. And I heard the number of them that
were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand who were sealed, out of every tribe of the
children of Israel; of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Roubem
twelve thousand.” And he mentioned each of the tribes singly, with the exception of Dan.
Then, some way further on,4457 he continues: “And I saw, and behold the Lamb standing
on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and
the name of His Father written on their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven as the
voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder. And the voice which I heard was
as the voice of harpers harping with their harps; and they sing a new song before the throne
and before the four beasts and the elders, and no one could learn the song but the hundred
and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth. These are they which
were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb
whithersover He goeth. These were purchased from among men, a first fruits to God and
to the Lamb; and in their mouth was found no lie, for they are without blemish.” Now this
is said in John with reference to those who have believed in Christ, for they also, even if
their bodily descent cannot be traced to the seed of the Patriarchs, are yet gathered out of

the tribes. That this is so we may conclude from what is further said about them: “Hurt
not,” he says, “the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our
God on their foreheads. And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and
forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of the children of Israel.”</p>

<head>2. The 144,000 Sealed in the Apocalypse are Converts to Christ from the Gentile
World.</head>
<p>These, then, who are sealed on their foreheads4458 from every tribe of the children of
Israel, are a hundred and forty-four thousand in number; and these hundred and forty-four
thousand are afterwards said in John to have the name of the Lamb and of His Father written
on their foreheads, and to be virgins, not having defiled themselves with women. What else
could the seal be which is on their foreheads but the name of the Lamb and the name of His
Father? In both passages their foreheads are said to have the seal; in one the seal is spoken
of, in the other it appears to contain the letters forming the name of the Lamb, and the name
of His Father. Now these taken from the tribes are, as we showed before, the same persons
as the virgins. But the number of believers is small who belong to Israel according to the
flesh; one might venture to assert that they would not nearly make up the number of a
hundred and forty-four thousand. It is clear, therefore, that the hundred and forty-four
thousand who have not defiled themselves with women must be made up of those who have
come to the divine word out of the Gentile world. In this way the truth of the statement
may be upheld that the first fruits of each tribe are its virgins. For the passage goes on:
“These were brought from among men to be a first fruits to God and to the Lamb; and in
their mouth was found no guile, for they are without blemish.” The statement about the
hundred and forty-four thousand no doubt admits of mystical interpretation; but it is unnecessary
at this point, and would divert us from our purpose, to compare with it those passages
of the prophets in which the same lesson is taught regarding those who are called from
among the Gentiles.</p>

<head>3. In the Spiritual Israel the High-Priests are Those Who Devote Themselves to the
Study of Scripture.</head>
<p>But what is the bearing of all this for us? So you will ask when you read these words,
Ambrosius, thou who art truly a man of God, a man in Christ, and who seekest to be not a
man only, but a spiritual man.4459 The bearing is this. Those of the tribes offer to God,
through the levites and priests, tithes and first fruits; not everything which they possess do
they regard as tithe or first fruit. The levites and priests, on the other hand, have no possessions
but tithes and first fruits; yet they also in turn offer tithes to God through the highpriests,
and, I believe, first fruits too. The same is the case with those who approach Christian
studies. Most of us devote most of our time to the things of this life, and dedicate to
God only a few special acts, thus resembling those members of the tribes who had but few
transactions with the priest, and discharged their religious duties with no great expense of
time. But those who devote themselves to the divine word and have no other employment
but the service of God may not unnaturally, allowing for the difference of occupation in the
two cases, be called our levites and priests. And those who fulfil a more distinguished office
than their kinsmen4460 will perhaps be high-priests, according to the order of Aaron, not
that of Melchisedek. Here some one may object that it is somewhat too bold to apply the
name of high-priests to men, when Jesus Himself is spoken of in many a prophetic passage
as the one great priest, as4461 “We have a great high-priest who has passed through the
heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.” But to this we reply that the Apostle clearly defined his
meaning, and declared the prophet to have said about the Christ, “Thou4462 art a priest for
ever, according to the order of Melchisedek,” and not according to the order of Aaron. We
say accordingly that men can be high-priests according to the order of Aaron, but according
to the order of Melchisedek only the Christ of God.</p>

<head>4. The Study of the Gospels is the First Fruits Offered by These Priests of Christianity.</head>
<p>Now our whole activity is devoted to God, and our whole life, since we are bent on
progress in divine things. If, then, it be our desire to have the whole of those first fruits
spoken of above which are made up of the many first fruits, if we are not mistaken in this
view, in what must our first fruits consist, after the bodily separation we have undergone
from each other, but in the study of the Gospel? For we may venture to say that the Gospel
is the first fruits of all the Scriptures. Where, then, could be the first fruits of our activity,
since the time when we came to Alexandria, but in the first fruits of the Scriptures? It must
not be forgotten, however, that the first fruits are not the same as the first growth. For the
first fruits4463 are offered after all the fruits (are ripe), but the first growth4464 before them
all. Now of the Scriptures which are current and are believed to be divine in all the churches,
one would not be wrong in saying that the first growth is the law of Moses, but the first
fruits the Gospel. For it was after all the fruits of the prophets who prophesied till the Lord
Jesus, that the perfect word shot forth.</p>

<head>5. All Scripture is Gospel; But the Gospels are Distinguished Above Other Scriptures.</head>
<p>Here, however, some one may object, appealing to the notion just put forward of the
unfolding of the first fruits last, and may say that the Acts and the letters of the Apostles
came after the Gospels, and that this destroys our argument to the effect that the Gospel is
the first fruits of all Scripture. To this we must reply that it is the conviction of men who
are wise in Christ, who have profited by those epistles which are current, and who see them
to be vouched for by the testimonies deposited in the law and the prophets,4465 that the
apostolic writings are to be pronounced wise and worthy of belief, and that they have great
authority, but that they are not on the same level with that “Thus sayeth the Lord
Almighty.”4466 Consider on this point the language of St. Paul. When he declares that4467
“Every Scripture is inspired of God and profitable,” does he include his own writings? Or
does he not include his dictum,4468 “I say, and not the Lord,” and4469 “So I ordain in all the
churches,” and4470 “What things I suffered at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra,” and similar
things which he writes in virtue of his own authority, and which do not quite possess the
character of words flowing from divine inspiration. Must we also show that the old Scripture
is not Gospel, since it does not point out the Coming One, but only foretells Him and heralds
His coming at a future time; but that all the new Scripture is the Gospel. It not only says as
in the beginning of the Gospel,4471 “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of
the world;” it also contains many praises of Him, and many of His teachings, on whose account
the Gospel is a Gospel. Again, if God set in the Church4472 apostles and prophets
and evangelists (gospellers), pastors and teachers, we must first enquire what was the office
of the evangelist, and mark that it is not only to narrate how the Saviour cured a man who
was blind from his birth,4473 or raised up a dead man who was already stinking,4474 or to
state what extraordinary works he wrought; and the office of the evangelist being thus
defined, we shall not hesitate to find Gospel in such discourse also as is not narrative but
hortatory and intended to strengthen belief in the mission of Jesus; and thus we shall arrive
at the position that whatever was written by the Apostles is Gospel. As to this second

definition, it might be objected that the Epistles are not entitled “Gospel,” and that we are
wrong in applying the name of Gospel to the whole of the New Testament. But to this we
answer that it happens not unfrequently in Scripture when two or more persons or things
are named by the same name, the name attaches itself most significantly to one of those
things or persons. Thus the Saviour says,4475 “Call no man Master upon the earth;” while
the Apostle says that Masters4476 have been appointed in the Church. These latter accordingly
will not be Masters in the strict sense of the dictum of the Gospel. In the same way
the Gospel in the Epistles will not extend to every word of them, when it is compared with
the narrative of Jesus’ actions and sufferings and discourses. No: the Gospel is the first
fruits of all Scripture, and to these first fruits of the Scriptures we devote the first fruits of
all those actions of ours which we trust to see turn out as we desire.</p>

<head>6. The Fourfold Gospel. John’s the First Fruits of the Four. Qualifications Necessary
for Interpreting It.</head>
<p>Now the Gospels are four. These four are, as it were, the elements of the faith of the
Church, out of which elements the whole world which is reconciled to God in Christ is put
together; as Paul says,4477 “God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself;” of which
world Jesus bore the sin; for it is of the world of the Church that the word is written,4478
“Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.” The Gospels then being
four, I deem the first fruits of the Gospels to be that which you4479 have enjoined me to
search into according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him whose
genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of him at a point before he
had any genealogy. For Matthew, writing for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was
to come of the line of Abraham and of David, says:4480 “The book of the generation of Jesus
Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.” And Mark, knowing what he writes, narrates
the beginning of the Gospel; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the beginning
the Word, God the Word. But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, “The former
treatise did I make about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,” yet leaves to him who lay
on Jesus’ breast the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus. For none of these plainly
declared His Godhead, as John does when he makes Him say, “I am the light of the world,”
“I am the way and the truth and the life,” “I am the resurrection,” “I am the door,” “I am
the good shepherd;” and in the Apocalypse, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning
and the end, the first and the last.” We may therefore make bold to say that the Gospels are
the first fruits of all the Scriptures, but that of the Gospels that of John is the first fruits. No
one can apprehend the meaning of it except he have lain on Jesus’ breast and received from
Jesus Mary to be his mother also. Such an one must he become who is to be another John,
and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is. For if Mary, as those
declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to
His mother, “Woman, behold thy son,”4481 and not “Behold you have this son also,” then
He virtually said to her, “Lo, this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.” Is it not the case that
every one who is perfect lives himself no longer,4482 but Christ lives in him; and if Christ
lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, “Behold thy son Christ.” What a mind, then,
must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed

to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read,
and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears? What
shall we say of this work? He who is accurately to apprehend what it contains should be
able to say with truth,4483 “We have the mind of Christ, that we may know those things
which are bestowed on us by God.” It is possible to quote one of Paul’s sayings in support
of the contention that the whole of the New Testament is Gospel. He writes in a certain
place:4484 “According to my Gospel.” Now we have no written work of Paul which is
commonly called a Gospel. But all that he preached and said was the Gospel; and what he
preached and said he was also in the habit of writing, and what he wrote was therefore
Gospel. But if what Paul wrote was Gospel, it follows that what Peter wrote was also Gospel,
and in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the knowledge of Christ’s sojourn
on earth, and to prepare for His second coming, or to bring it about as a present reality in
those souls which were willing to receive the Word of God as He stood at the door and
knocked and sought to come into them.</p>

<head>7. What Good Things are Announced in the Gospels.</head>
<p>But it is time we should inquire what is the meaning of the designation “Gospel,” and
why these books have this title. Now the Gospel is a discourse containing a promise of
things which naturally, and on account of the benefits they bring, rejoice the hearer as soon
as the promise is heard and believed. Nor is such a discourse any the less a Gospel that we
define it with reference to the position of the hearer. A Gospel is either a word which implies
the actual presence to the believer of something that is good, or a word promising the arrival
of a good which is expected. Now all these definitions apply to those books which are named
Gospels. For each of the Gospels is a collection of announcements which are useful to him
who believes them and does not misinterpret them; it brings him a benefit and naturally
makes him glad because it tells of the sojourn with men, on account of men, and for their
salvation, of the first-born of all creation,4485 Christ Jesus. And again each Gospel tells of
the sojourn of the good Father in the Son with those minded to receive Him, as is plain to
every believer; and moreover by these books a good is announced which had been formerly
expected, as is by no means hard to see. For John the Baptist spoke in the name almost of
the whole people when he sent to Jesus and asked,4486 “Art thou He that should come or
do we look for another?” For to the people the Messiah was an expected good, which the
prophets had foretold, and they all alike, though under the law and the prophets, fixed their
hopes on Him, as the Samaritan woman bears witness when she says:4487 “I know that the
Messiah comes, who is called Christ; when He comes He will tell us all things.” Simon and
Cleopas too, when talking to each other about all that had happened to Jesus Christ Himself,
then risen, though they did not know that He had risen from the dead, speak thus,4488 “Dost
thou sojourn alone in Jerusalem, and knowest not the things which have taken place there
in these days? And when he said what things? they answered, The things concerning Jesus
of Nazareth,4489 which was a prophet, mighty in deed and in word before God and all the
people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death
and crucified Him. But we hoped that it was He which should redeem Israel.” Again, Andrew
the brother of Simon Peter found his own brother Simon and said to him,4490 “We have
found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ.” And a little further on Philip finds

<head>8. How the Gospels Cause the Other Books of Scripture Also to Be Gospel.</head>
<p>Now an objection might be raised to our first definition, because it would embrace
books which are not entitled Gospels. For the law and the prophets also are to our eyes
books containing the promise of things which, from the benefit they will confer on him,
naturally rejoice the hearer as soon as he takes in the message. To this it may be said that
before the sojourn of Christ, the law and the prophets, since He had not come who interpreted
the mysteries they contained, did not convey such a promise as belongs to our definition of
the Gospel; but the Saviour, when He sojourned with men and caused the Gospel to appear
in bodily form, by the Gospel caused all things to appear as Gospel. Here I would not think
it beside the purpose to quote the example of Him who…a few things…and yet all.4492 For
when he had taken away the veil which was present in the law and the prophets, and by His
divinity had proved the sons of men that the Godhead was at work, He opened the way for
all those who desired it to be disciples of His wisdom, and to understand what things were
true and real in the law of Moses, of which things those of old worshipped the type and the
shadow, and what things were real of the things narrated in the histories which “happened
to them in the way of type,”4493 but these things “were written for our sakes, upon whom
the ends of the ages have come.” With whomsoever, then, Christ has sojourned, he worships
God neither at Jerusalem nor on the mountain of the Samaritans; he knows that God is a
spirit, and worships Him spiritually, in spirit and in truth; no longer by type does he worship
the Father and Maker of all. Before that Gospel, therefore, which came into being by the
sojourning of Christ, none of the older works was a Gospel. But the Gospel, which is the
new covenant, having delivered us from the oldness of the letter, lights up for us, by the
light of knowledge,4494 the newness of the spirit, a thing which never grows old, which has
its home in the New Testament, but is also present in all the Scriptures. It was fitting,
therefore, that that Gospel, which enables us to find the Gospel present, even in the Old
Testament, should itself receive, in a special sense, the name of Gospel.</p>

<head>9. The Somatic and the Spiritual Gospel.</head>
<p>We must not, however, forget that the sojourning of Christ with men took place before
His bodily sojourn, in an intellectual fashion, to those who were more perfect and not children,
and were not under pedagogues and governors. In their minds they saw the fulness
of the time to be at hand—the patriarchs, and Moses the servant, and the prophets who beheld
the glory of Christ. And as before His manifest and bodily coming He came to those who
were perfect, so also, after His coming has been announced to all, to those who are still
children, since they are under pedagogues and governors and have not yet arrived at the
fulness of the time, forerunners of Christ have come to sojourn, discourses (logoi) suited
for minds still in their childhood, and rightly, therefore, termed pedagogues. But the Son
Himself, the glorified God, the Word, has not yet come; He waits for the preparation which
must take place on the part of men of God who are to admit His deity. And this, too, we
must bear in mind, that as the law contains a shadow of good things to come, which are
indicated by that law which is announced according to truth, so the Gospel also teaches a
shadow of the mysteries of Christ, the Gospel which is thought to be capable of being understood
by any one. What John calls the eternal Gospel, and what may properly be called the
spiritual Gospel, presents clearly to those who have the will to understand, all matters concerning
the very Son of God, both the mysteries presented by His discourses and those
matters of which His acts were the enigmas. In accordance with this we may conclude that,
as it is with Him who is a Jew outwardly and circumcised in the flesh, so it is with the
Christian and with baptism. Paul and Peter were, at an earlier period, Jews outwardly and
circumcised, but later they received from Christ that they should be so in secret, too; so that
outwardly they were Jews for the sake of the salvation of many, and by an economy they
not only confessed in words that they were Jews, but showed it by their actions. And the
same is to be said about their Christianity. As Paul could not benefit those who were Jews
according to the flesh, without, when reason shows it to be necessary, circumcising Timothy,
and when it appears the natural course getting himself shaved and making a vow, and, in a
word, being to the Jews a Jew that he might gain the Jews—so also it is not possible for one
who is responsible for the good of many to operate as he should by means of that Christianity
only which is in secret. That will never enable him to improve those who are following the
external Christianity, or to lead them on to better and higher things. We must, therefore,
be Christians both somatically and spiritually, and where there is a call for the somatic
(bodily) Gospel, in which a man says to those who are carnal that he knows nothing but
Jesus Christ and Him crucified, so we must do. But should we find those who are perfected
in the spirit, and bear fruit in it, and are enamoured of the heavenly wisdom, these must be
made to partake of that Word which, after it was made flesh, rose again to what it was in
the beginning, with God.</p>

<head>10. How Jesus Himself is the Gospel.</head>
<p>The foregoing inquiry into the nature of the Gospel cannot be regarded as useless; it
has enabled us to see what distinction there is between a sensible Gospel and an intellectual
and spiritual one. What we have now to do is to transform the sensible Gospel into a spiritual
one.</p>
<p>For what would the narrative of the sensible Gospel amount to if it were not developed
to a spiritual one? It would be of little account or none; any one can read it and assure
himself of the facts it tells—no more. But our whole energy is now to be directed to the effort
to penetrate to the deep things of the meaning of the Gospel and to search out the truth that
is in it when divested of types. Now what the Gospels say is to be regarded in the light of
promises of good things; and we must say that the good things the Apostles announce in
this Gospel are simply Jesus. One good thing which they are said to announce is the resurrection;
but the resurrection is in a manner Jesus, for Jesus says:4495 “I am the resurrection.”
Jesus preaches to the poor those things which are laid up for the saints, calling them to the
divine promises. And the holy Scriptures bear witness to the Gospel announcements made
by the Apostles and to that made by our Saviour. David says of the Apostles, perhaps also
of the evangelists:4496 “The Lord shall give the word to those that preach with great power;
the King of the powers of the beloved;” teaching at the same time that it is not skilfully
composed discourse, nor the mode of delivery, nor well practised eloquence that produces
conviction, but the communication of divine power. Hence also Paul says:4497 “I will know
not the word that is puffed up, but the power; for the kingdom of God is not in word but
in power.” And in another passage:4498 “And my word and my preaching were not persuasive
words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power.” To this power Simon
and Cleophas bear witness when they say:4499 “Was not our heart burning within us by the
way, as he opened to us the Scriptures?” And the Apostles, since the quantity of the power
is great which God supplies to the speakers, had great power, according to the word of
David: “The Lord will give the word to the preachers with great power.” Isaiah too says:4500
“How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim good tidings;” he sees how beautiful and
how opportune was the announcement of the Apostles who walked in Him who said, “I am
the way,” and praises the feet of those who walk in the intellectual way of Christ Jesus, and

namely, Jesus.</p>

<pb n="553"/>
<head>11. Jesus is All Good Things; Hence the Gospel is Manifold.</head>
<p>Let no one wonder if we have understood Jesus to be announced in the Gospel under
a plurality of names of good things. If we look at the things by the names of which the Son
of God is called, we shall understand how many good things Jesus is, whom those preach
whose feet are beautiful. One good thing is life; but Jesus is the life. Another good thing is
the light of the world, when it is true light, and the light of men; and all these things the Son
of God is said to be. And another good thing which one may conceive to be in addition to
life or light is the truth. And a fourth in addition to time is the way which leads to the truth.
And all these things our Saviour teaches that He is, when He says:4501 “I am the way and
the truth and the life.” Ah, is not that good, to shake off earth and mortality, and to rise
again, obtaining this boon from the Lord, since He is the resurrection, as He says:4502 “I
am the resurrection.” But the door also is a good, through which one enters into the highest
blessedness. Now Christ says:4503 “I am the door.” And what need is there to speak of
wisdom, which “the Lord created4504 the first principle of His ways, for His works,” in whom
the father of her rejoiced, delighting in her manifold intellectual beauty, seen by the eyes of
the mind alone, and provoking him to love who discerns her divine and heavenly charm?
A good indeed is the wisdom of God, proclaimed along with the other good foresaid by
those whose feet are beautiful. And the power of God is the eighth good we enumerate,
which is Christ. Nor must we omit to mention the Word, who is God after the Father of
all. For this also is a good, less than no other. Happy, then, are those who accept these
goods and receive them from those who announce the good tidings of them, those whose
feet are beautiful. Indeed even one of the Corinthians to whom Paul declared that he knew
nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, should he learn Him who for our sakes became
man, and so receive Him, he would become identified with the beginning of the good things
we have spoken of; by the man Jesus he would be made a man of God, and by His death he
would die to sin. For “Christ,4505 in that He died, died unto sin once.” But from His life,
since “in that He liveth, He liveth unto God,” every one who is conformed to His resurrection
receives that living to God. But who will deny that righteousness, essential righteousness,
is a good, and essential sanctification, and essential redemption? And these things those
preach who preach Jesus, saying4506 that He is made to be of God righteousness and sanctification
and redemption. Hence we shall have writings about Him without number, showing

<pb n="554"/>
that Jesus is a multitude of goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered and
which have been written we may make some conjecture of those things which actually exist
in Him in whom4507 “it pleased God that the whole fulness of the Godhead should dwell
bodily,” and which are not contained in writings. Why should I say, “are not contained in
writings”? For John speaks of the whole world in this connection, and says:4508 “I suppose
that not even the world itself would contain the books which would be written.” Now to
say that the Apostles preach the Saviour is to say that they preach these good things. For
this is He who received from the good Father that He Himself should be these good things,
so that each man receiving from Jesus the thing or things he is capable of receiving may
enjoy good things. But the Apostles, whose feet were beautiful, and those imitators of them
who sought to preach the good tidings, could not have done so had not Jesus Himself first
preached the good tidings to them, as Isaiah says:4509 “I myself that speak am here, as the
opportunity on the mountains, as the feet of one preaching tidings of peace, as one preaching
good things; for I will make My salvation to be heard, saying, God shall reign over thee, O
Zion!” For what are the mountains on which the speaker declares that He Himself is present,
but those who are less than none of the highest and the greatest of the earth? And these
must be sought by the able ministers of the New Covenant, in order that they may observe
the injunction which says:4510 Go up into a high mountain, thou that preachest good tidings
to Zion; thou that preachest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength!” Now
it is not wonderful if to those who are to preach good tidings Jesus Himself preaches good
tidings of good things, which are no other than Himself; for the Son of God preaches the
good tidings of Himself to those who cannot come to know Him through others. And He
who goes up into the mountains and preaches good things to them, being Himself instructed
by His good Father,4511 who “makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends
rain on the just and on the unjust,” He does not despise those who are poor in soul. To
them He preaches good tidings, as He Himself bears witness to us when He takes Isaiah4512
and reads: “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the Lord hath anointed me to preach
good tidings to the poor, He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to
the blind. For closing the book He handed it to the minister and sat down. And when the
eyes of all were fastened upon Him, He said, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.”</p>

<head>12. The Gospel Contains the Ill Deeds Also Which Were Done to Jesus.</head>
<p>It ought not to be forgotten that in such a Gospel as this there is embraced every good
deed which was done to Jesus; as, for example, the story of the woman4513 who had been a
sinner and had repented, and who, having experienced a genuine recovery from her evil
state, had grace to pour her ointment over Jesus so that every one in the house smelt the
sweet savour. Hence, too, the words, “Wherever this Gospel shall be preached among all
the nations, there also this that she has done shall be spoken of, for a memorial of her.”
And it is clear that whatever is done to the disciples of Jesus is done to Him. Pointing to
those of them who met with kind treatment, He says to those who were kind to them,4514
“What ye did to these, ye did to Me.” So that every good deed we do to our neighbours is
entered in the Gospel, that Gospel which is written on the heavenly tablets and read by all
who are worthy of the knowledge of the whole of things. But on the other side, too, there
is a part of the Gospel which is for the condemnation of the doers of the ill deeds which
have been done to Jesus. The treachery of Judas and the shouts of the wicked crowd when
it said,4515 “Away with such a one from the earth,” and “Crucify Him, crucify Him,” the
mockings of those who crowned Him with thorns, and everything of that kind, is included
in the Gospels. And as a consequence of this we see that every one who betrays the disciples
of Jesus is reckoned as betraying Jesus Himself. To Saul,4516 when still a persecutor it is
said, “Saul Saul, why persecutest thou Me?” and, “I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.” There
are those who still have thorns with which they crown and dishonour Jesus, those, namely,
who are choked by the cares, and riches, and pleasures of life, and though they have received
the word of God, do not bring it to perfection.4517 We must beware, therefore, lest we also,
as crowning Jesus with thorns of our own, should be entered in the Gospel and read of in
this character by those who learn the Jesus, who is in all and is present in all rational and
holy lives, learn how He is anointed with ointment, is entertained, is glorified, or how, on
the other side, He is dishonoured, and mocked, and beaten. All this had to be said; it is part
of our demonstration that our good actions, and also the sins of those who stumble, are
embodied in the Gospel, either to everlasting life or to reproach and everlasting shame.</p>

<head>13. The Angels Also are Evangelists.</head>
<p>Now if there are those among men who are honoured with the ministry of evangelists,
and if Jesus Himself brings tidings of good things, and preaches the Gospel to the poor,
surely those messengers who were made spirits by God,4518 those who are a flame of fire,
ministers of the Father of all, cannot have been excluded from being evangelists also. Hence
an angel standing over the shepherds made a bright light to shine round about them, and
said:4519 “Fear not; behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the
people; for there is born to you, this day, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of
David.” And at a time when there was no knowledge among men of the mystery of the
Gospel, those who were greater than men and inhabitants of heaven, the army of God,
praised God, saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will among
men.”4520 And having said this, the angels go away from the shepherds into heaven, leaving
us to gather how the joy preached to us through the birth of Jesus Christ is glory in the
highest to God; they humbled themselves even to the ground, and then returned to their
place of rest, to glorify God in the highest through Jesus Christ. But the angels also wonder
at the peace which is to be brought about on account of Jesus on the earth, that seat of war,
on which Lucifer, star of the morning, fell from heaven, to be warred against and destroyed
by Jesus.</p>

<head>14. The Old Testament, Typified by John, is the Beginning of the Gospel.</head>
<p>In addition to what we have said, there is also this to be considered about the Gospel,
that in the first instance it is that of Christ Jesus, the head of the whole body of the saved;
as Mark says,4521 “The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.” Then also it is the Gospel
of the Apostles; whence Paul4522 says, “According to my Gospel.” But the beginning of the
Gospel—for in respect of its extent it has a beginning, a continuation, a middle, and an
end—is nothing but the whole Old Testament. John is, in this respect, a type of the Old
Testament, or, if we regard the connection of the New Testament with the Old, John represents
the termination of the Old. For the same Mark says:4523 “The beginning of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold I send my messenger before thy
face, who shall prepare thy way. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
way of the Lord, make His paths straight.” And here I must wonder how the dissentients4524
can connect the two Testaments with two different Gods. These words, were there no others,
are enough to convict them of their error. For how can John be the beginning of the Gospel
if they suppose he belongs to a different God, if he belongs to the demiurge, and, as they
hold, is not acquainted with the new deity? And the angels are not entrusted with but one
evangelical ministry, and that a short one, not only with that addressed to the shepherds.
For at the end an exalted and flying angel, having the Gospel, will preach it to every nation,
for the good Father has not entirely deserted those who have fallen away from Him. John,
son of Zebedee, says in his Apocalypse:4525 “And I saw an angel flying in the midst of
heaven, having the Eternal Gospel, to preach it to those who dwell upon the earth, and to
every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people, saying, with a loud voice, Fear God and
give Him glory, for the hour of His judgment hath come, and worship Him that made the
heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”</p>

<head>15. The Gospel is in the Old Testament, and Indeed in the Whole Universe. Prayer
for Aid to Understand the Mystical Sense of the Work in Hand.</head>
<p>As, then, we have shown that the beginning of the Gospel, according to one interpretation,
is the whole Old Testament, and is signified by the person of John, we shall add, lest
this should be called a mere unsupported assertion, what is said in the Acts4526 about the
eunuch of the queen of the Ethiopians and Philip. Philip, it is said, began at the passage of
Isaiah: “He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb,”
and so preached to him the Lord Jesus. How can he begin with the prophet and preach Jesus,
if Isaiah was not a part of the beginning of the Gospel? From this we may derive a proof of
the assertion made at the outset, that every divine Scripture is Gospel. If he who preaches
the Gospel preaches good things, and all those who spoke before the sojourn of Jesus in the
flesh preach Christ, who is as we saw good things, then the words spoken by all of them
alike are in a sense a part of the Gospel. And when the Gospel is said to be declared
throughout the whole world, we infer that it is actually preached in the whole world, not,
that is to say, in this earthly district only, but in the whole system of heaven and earth, or
from heaven and earth. And why should we discuss any further what the Gospel is? What
we have said is enough. Besides the passages we have adduced, passages by no means inept
or unsuited for our purpose,—much to the same effect might be collected from the Scriptures,
so that it is clearly seen what is the glory of the good things in Jesus Christ shed forth by the
Gospel, the Gospel ministered by men and angels, and, I believe, also by authorities and
powers,4527 and thrones and dominions, and every name that is named, not only in this
world, but also in the world to come, and indeed even by Christ Himself. Here, then, let us
bring to a close what has to be said before proceeding to read the work itself. And now let
us ask God to assist us through Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit, so that we may be able to
unfold the mystical sense which is treasured up in the words before us.</p>

<head>16. Meaning of “Beginning.” (1) in Space.</head>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word.”4528 It is not only the Greeks who consider the word
“beginning” to have many meanings. Let any one collect the Scripture passages in which
the word occurs, and with a view to an accurate interpretation of it note what it stands for
in each passage, and he will find that the word has many meanings in sacred discourse also.
We speak of a beginning in reference to a transition. Here it has to do with a road and with
length. This appears in the saying:4529 “The beginning of a good way is to do justice.” For
since the good way is long, there have first to be considered in reference to it the question
connected with action, and this side is presented in the words “to do justice;” the contemplative
side comes up for consideration afterwards. In the latter the end of it comes to rest
at last in the so-called restoration of all things, since no enemy is left them to fight against,
if that be true which is said:4530 “For He must reign until He have placed His enemies under
His feet. But the last enemy to be destroyed is death.” For then but one activity will be left
for those who have come to God on account of His word which is with Him, that, namely,
of knowing God, so that, being found by the knowledge of the Father, they may all be His
Son, as now no one but the Son knows the Father. For should any one enquire carefully at
what time those are to know the Father to whom He who knows the Father reveals Him,
and should he consider how a man now sees only through a glass and in a riddle, never
having learned to know as he ought to know, he would be justified in saying that no one,
no apostle even, and no prophet had known the Father, but when he became one with Him
as a son and a father are one. And if any one says that it is a digression which has led us to
this point, our consideration of that one meaning of the word beginning, we must show
that the digression is necessary and useful for the end we have in view. For if we speak of
a beginning in the case of a transition, and of a way and its length, and if we are told that
the beginning of a good way is to do justice, then it concerns us to know in what manner
every good way has for its beginning to do justice, and how after such beginning it arrives
at contemplation, and in what manner it thus arrives at contemplation.</p>

<head>17. (2) in Time. The Beginning of Creation.</head>
<p>Again, there is a beginning in a matter of origin, as might appear in the saying:4531 “In
the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.” This meaning, however, appears more
plainly in the Book of Job in the passage:4532 “This is the beginning of God’s creation, made
for His angels to mock at.” One would suppose that the heavens and the earth were made
first, of all that was made at the creation of the world. But the second passage suggests a
better view, namely, that as many beings were framed with a body, the first made of these
was the creature called dragon, but called in another passage4533 the great whale (leviathan)
which the Lord tamed. We must ask about this; whether, when the saints were living a
blessed life apart from matter and from any body, the dragon, falling from the pure life,
became fit to be bound in matter and in a body, so that the Lord could say, speaking through
storm and clouds, “This is the beginning of the creation of God, made for His angels to
mock at.” It is possible, however, that the dragon is not positively the beginning of the creation
of the Lord, but that there were many creatures made with a body for the angels to
mock at, and that the dragon was the first of these, while others could subsist in a body
without such reproach. But it is not so. For the soul of the sun is placed in a body, and the
whole creation, of which the Apostle says:4534 “The whole creation groaneth and travaileth
in pain together until now,” and perhaps the following is about the same: “The creation
was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it for hope;”
so that bodies might be in vanity, and doing the things of the body, as he who is in the body
must.4535…One who is in the body does the things of the body, though unwillingly.
Wherefore the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but he who does unwillingly
the things of the body does what he does for the sake of hope, as if we should say that Paul
desired to remain in the flesh, not willingly, but on account of hope. For though he thought
it better4536 to be dissolved and to be with Christ, it was not unreasonable that he should
wish to remain in the flesh for the sake of the benefit to others and of advancement in the
things hoped for, not only by him, but also by those benefited by him. This meaning of the
term “beginning,” as of origin, will serve us also in the passage in which Wisdom speaks in
the Proverbs.4537 “God,” we read, “created me the beginning of His ways, for His works.”
Here the term could be interpreted as in the first application we spoke of, that of a way:

“The Lord,” it says, “created me the beginning of His ways.” One might assert, and with
reason, that God Himself is the beginning of all things, and might go on to say, as is plain,
that the Father is the beginning of the Son; and the demiurge the beginning of the works of
the demiurge, and that God in a word is the beginning of all that exists. This view is supported
by our: “In the beginning was the Word.” In the Word one may see the Son, and because
He is in the Father He may be said to be in the beginning.</p>

<p>In the third place a beginning may be that out of which a thing comes, the underlying
matter from which things are formed. This, however, is the view of those who hold matter
itself to be uncreated, a view which we believers cannot share, since we believe God to have
made the things that are out of the things which are not, as the mother of the seven martyrs
in the Maccabees teaches,4538 and as the angel of repentance in the Shepherd inculcated.4539</p>

<p>In addition to these meanings there is that in which we speak of an arche,4540 according
to form; thus if the first-born of every creature4541 is the image of the invisible God, then
the Father is his arche. In the same way Christ is the arche of those who are made according
to the image of God. For if men are according to the image, but the image according to the
Father; in the first case the Father is the arche of Christ, and in the other Christ is the arche
of men, and men are made, not according to that of which he is the image, but according
to the image. With this example our passage will agree: “In the arche was the Word.”</p>

<head>20. (5) of Elements and What is Formed from Them.</head>
<p>There is also an arche in a matter of learning, as when we say that the letters are the
arche of grammar. The Apostle accordingly says:4542 “When by reason of the time you
ought to be teachers, you have need again that some one teach you what are the elements
of the arche of the oracles of God.” Now the arche spoken of in connection with learning
is twofold; first in respect of its nature, secondly in its relation to us; as we might say of
Christ, that by nature His arche is deity, but that in relation to us who cannot, for its very
greatness, command the whole truth about Him, His arche is His manhood, as He is preached
to babes, “Jesus Christ and Him crucified.” In this view, then, Christ is the arche of learning
in His own nature, because He is the wisdom and power of God; but for us, the Word was
made flesh, that He might tabernacle among us who could only thus at first receive Him.
And perhaps this is the reason why He is not only the firstborn of all creation, but is also
designated the man, Adam. For Paul says He is Adam:4543 “The last Adam was made a
life-giving spirit.”</p>

<head>22. The Word Was in the Beginning, I.e., in Wisdom, Which Contained All Things
in Idea, Before They Existed. Christ’s Character as Wisdom is Prior to His
Other Characters.</head>
<p>So many meanings occur to us at once of the word arche. We have now to ask which
of them we should adopt for our text, “In the beginning was the Word.” It is plain that we
may at once dismiss the meaning which connects it with transition or with a road and its
length. Nor, it is pretty plain, will the meaning connected with an origin serve our purpose.
One might, however, think of the sense in which it points to the author, to that which brings
about the effect, if, as we read,4544 “God commanded and they were created.” For Christ
is, in a manner, the demiurge, to whom the Father says, “Let there be light,” and “Let there
be a firmament.” But Christ is demiurge as a beginning (arche), inasmuch as He is wisdom.
It is in virtue of His being wisdom that He is called arche. For Wisdom says in Solomon:4545
“God created me the beginning of His ways, for His works,” so that the Word might be in
an arche, namely, in wisdom. Considered in relation to the structure of contemplation and
thoughts about the whole of things, it is regarded as wisdom; but in relation to that side of
the objects of thought, in which reasonable beings apprehend them, it is considered as the
Word. And there is no wonder, since, as we have said before, the Saviour is many good
things, if He comprises in Himself thoughts of the first order, and of the second, and of the
third. This is what John suggested when he said about the Word:4546 “That which was
made was life in Him.” Life then came in the Word. And on the one side the Word is no
other than the Christ, the Word, He who was with the Father, by whom all things were
made; while, on the other side, the Life is no other than the Son of God, who says:4547 “I
am the way and the truth and the life.” As, then, life came into being in the Word, so the
Word in the arche. Consider, however, if we are at liberty to take this meaning of arche for
our text: “In the beginning was the Word,” so as to obtain the meaning that all things came
into being according to wisdom and according to the models of the system which are present
in his thoughts. For I consider that as a house or a ship is built and fashioned in accordance
with the sketches of the builder or designer, the house or the ship having their beginning
(arche) in the sketches and reckonings in his mind, so all things came into being in accordance
with the designs of what was to be, clearly laid down by God in wisdom. And we should
add that having created, so to speak, ensouled4548 wisdom, He left her to hand over, from

the types which were in her, to things existing and to matter, the actual emergence of them,
their moulding and their forms.4549 But I consider, if it be permitted to say this, that the
beginning (arche) of real existence was the Son of God, saying:4550 “I am the beginning
and the end, the Α and the Ω, the first and the last.” We must, however, remember that He
is not the arche in respect of every name which is applied to Him. For how can He be the
beginning in respect of His being life, when life came in the Word, and the Word is manifestly
the arche of life? It is also tolerably evident that He cannot be the arche in respect of His
being the first-born from the dead. And if we go through all His titles carefully we find that
He is the arche only in respect of His being wisdom. Not even as the Word is He the arche,
for the Word was in the arche. And so one might venture to say that wisdom is anterior to
all the thoughts that are expressed in the titles of the first-born of every creature. Now God
is altogether one and simple; but our Saviour, for many reasons, since God4551 set Him
forth a propitiation and a first fruits of the whole creation, is made many things, or perhaps
all these things; the whole creation, so far as capable of redemption, stands in need of
Him.4552 And, hence, He is made the light of men, because men, being darkened by
wickedness, need the light that shines in darkness, and is not overtaken by the darkness;
had not men been in darkness, He would not have become the light of men. The same thing
may be observed in respect of His being the first-born of the dead. For supposing the woman
had not been deceived, and Adam had not fallen, and man created for incorruption had
obtained it, then He would not have descended into the grave, nor would He have died,
there being no sin, nor would His love of men have required that He should die, and if He
had not died, He could not have been the first-born of the dead. We may also ask whether
He would ever have become a shepherd, had man not been thrown together with the beasts
which are devoid of reason, and made like to them. For if God saves man and beasts, He
saves those beasts which He does save, by giving them a shepherd, since they cannot have
a king. Thus if we collect the titles of Jesus, the question arises which of them were conferred
on Him later, and would never have assumed such importance if the saints had begun and
had also persevered in blessedness. Perhaps Wisdom would be the only remaining one, or
perhaps the Word would remain too, or perhaps the Life, or perhaps the Truth, not the
others, which He took for our sake. And happy indeed are those who in their need for the
Son of God have yet become such persons as not to need Him in His character as a physician

<head>23. The Title “Word” Is to Be Interpreted by the Same Method as the Other Titles
of Christ. The Word of God is Not a Mere Attribute of God, But a Separate
Person. What is Meant When He is Called the Word.</head>
<p>Let us consider, however, a little more carefully what is the Word which is in the beginning.
I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even
by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of
names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should
remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense,
but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone
is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles,
search out what is behind the meaning of the term “Word.” I wonder at the stupidity of the
general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity.
The Son of God says in one passage, “I am the light of the world,” and in another, “I am the
resurrection,” and again, “I am the way and the truth and the life.” It is also written, “I am
the door,” and we have the saying, “I am the good shepherd,” and when the woman of
Samaria says, “We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He
will tell us all things,” Jesus answers, “I that speak unto thee am He.” Again, when He washed
the disciples’ feet, He declared Himself in these words4553 to be their Master and Lord:
“You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.” He also distinctly announces
Himself as the Son of God, when He says,4554 “He whom the Father sanctified and sent
unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?”
and4555 “Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.”
We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate’s question,4556
“Art Thou the King of the Jews?” by saying, “My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom
were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews,
but now is My kingdom not from hence.” We have also read the words,4557 “I am the true
vine and My Father is the husbandman,” and again, “I am the vine, ye are the branches.”
Add to these testimonies also the saying,4558 “I am the bread of life, that came down from
heaven and giveth life to the world.” These texts will suffice for the present, which we have
picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son

of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,4559 “I am the first and the last, and the
living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.” And again,4560 “I am the Α
and the Ω, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.” The careful student of the
sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where
He calls Himself4561 a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,4562 and a light of the Gentiles.4563
Isaiah also says,4564 “From my mother’s womb hath He called me by my name, and He
made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and
He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.” And a little
farther on: “And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for
thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of
Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation
to the end of the earth.” And in Jeremiah too4565 He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: “I
was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.” These and other similar sayings He applies
to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in
the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers
of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what
they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coming advent and announce
the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God,
saying,4566 “Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,” and in these
words he declares Him as a man,4567 “This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after
me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.” And in his Catholic Epistle John
says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:4568 “And if any one sin,
we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,” and he adds that He is a
propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:4569 “Whom God set
forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast
sins, in the forbearance of God.” According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom

and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:4570 “Christ the power of God
and the wisdom of God.” It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: “He
was made to us of God,” he says, “wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.”
But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:4571
“Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son
of God, let us hold fast our profession.” And the prophets have other names for Him besides
these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons4572 says, “Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy
hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion’s whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art
thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him?” We cannot
now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What
may be quoted against this view, viz., “A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from
his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved;” this can better be cleared up on another
occasion. But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel,
when he says,4573 “Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted
Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither
shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break, and smoking
flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall
the nations hope.” That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows
in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:4574 “That the saying might be fulfilled,
He shall not strive nor cry,” etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his
prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:4575 “I will raise up David my
servant, who shall be their shepherd.” For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and
be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:4576
“There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of this
root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be
full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.” And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as
follows:4577 “The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. It is
from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.” And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke

<pb n="572"/>
in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:4578 “Have ye never
read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls
on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.”
And Luke writes in Acts:4579 “This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders,
which has become the head of the corner.” And one of the names applied to the Saviour is
that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;—the Word who was in the
beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a
moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have
mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for
any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently
and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ
most is that in the Psalms,4580 “My heart hath produced a good Word;” and they imagine
the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly
they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis,
nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the
fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said
to be “Word” can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from
the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let
them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist,
therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to
the concept it suggests and apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described
by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice
it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense
Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way;
but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the
authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the
Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him.
This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the
thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are
used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have
entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can
and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more
about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.</p>

<head>24. Christ as Light; How He, and How His Disciples are the Light of the World.</head>
<p>He said, then, that He was the light of the world; and we have to examine, along with
this title, those which are parallel to it; and, indeed, are thought by some to be not merely
parallel, but identical with it. He is the true light, and the light of the Gentiles. In the
opening of the Gospel now before us He is the light of men: “That which was made,”4581
it says, “was life in Him, and the life was the light of men; and the light shines in darkness,
and the darkness did not overtake it.” A little further on, in the same passage, He is called
the true light:4582 “The true light, which lightens every man, was coming into the world.”
In Isaiah, He is the light of the Gentiles, as we said before. “Behold,4583 I have set Thee for
a light of the Gentiles, that Thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.” Now
the sensible light of the world is the sun, and after it comes very worthily the moon, and the
same title may be applied to the stars; but those lights of the world are said in Moses to have
come into existence on the fourth day, and as they shed light on the things on the earth,
they are not the true light. But the Saviour shines on creatures which have intellect and
sovereign reason, that their minds may behold their proper objects of vision, and so he is
the light of the intellectual world, that is to say, of the reasonable souls which are in the
sensible world, and if there be any beings beyond these in the world from which He declares
Himself to be our Saviour. He is, indeed, the most determining and distinguished part of
that world, and, as we may say, the sun who makes the great day of the Lord. In view of this
day He says to those who partake of His light, “Work4584 while it is day; the night cometh
when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” Then
He says to His disciples,4585 “Ye are the light of the world,” and “Let your light shine before
men.” Thus we see the Church, the bride, to present an analogy to the moon and stars, and
the disciples have a light, which is their own or borrowed from the true sun, so that they
are able to illuminate those who have no command of any spring of light in themselves.
We may say that Paul and Peter are the light of the world, and that those of their disciples
who are enlightened themselves, but are not able to enlighten others, are the world of which
the Apostles were the light. But the Saviour, being the light of the world, illuminates not
bodies, but by His incorporeal power the incorporeal intellect, to the end that each of us,
enlightened as by the sun, may be able to discern the rest of the things of the mind. And as
when the sun is shining the moon and the stars lose their power of giving light, so those
who are irradiated by Christ and receive His beams have no need of the ministering apostles

and prophets—we must have courage to declare this truth—nor of the angels; I will add that
they have no need even of the greater powers when they are disciples of that first-born light.
To those who do not receive the solar beams of Christ, the ministering saints do afford an
illumination much less than the former; this illumination is as much as those persons can
receive, and it completely fills them. Christ, again, the light of the world, is the true light as
distinguished from the light of sense; nothing that is sensible is true. Yet though the sensible
is other than the true, it does not follow that the sensible is false, for the sensible may have
an analogy with the intellectual, and not everything that is not true can correctly be called
false. Now I ask whether the light of the world is the same thing with the light of men, and
I conceive that a higher power of light is intended by the former phrase than by the latter,
for the world in one sense is not only men. Paul shows that the world is something more
than men when he writes to the Corinthians in his first Epistle:4586 “We are made a spectacle
unto the world, and to angels, and to men.” In one sense, too, it may be considered,4587 the
world is the creation which is being delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty
of the glory of the children of God, whose earnest expectation is waiting for the manifestation
of the sons of God. We also draw attention to the comparison which may be drawn between
the statement, “I am the light of the world,” and the words addressed to the disciples, “Ye
are the light of the world.” Some suppose that the genuine disciples of Jesus are greater than
other creatures, some seeking the reason of this in the natural growth of these disciples,
others inferring it from their harder struggle. For those beings which are in flesh and blood
have greater labours and a life more full of dangers than those which are in an ethereal body,
and the lights of heaven might not, if they had put on bodies of earth, have accomplished
this life of ours free from danger and from error. Those who incline to this argument may
appeal to those texts of Scripture which say the most exalted things about men, and to the
fact that the Gospel is addressed directly to men; not so much is said about the creation, or,
as we understand it, about the world. We read,4588 “As I and Thou are one, that they also
may be one in Us,” and4589 “Where I am, there will also My servant be.” These sayings,
plainly, are about men; while about the creation it is said that it is delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. It might be added
that not even when it is delivered will it take part in the glory of the sons of God. Nor will
those who hold this view forget that the first-born of every creature, honouring man above
all else, became man, and that it was not any of the constellations existing in the sky, but
one of another order, appointed for this purpose and in the service of the knowledge of Jesus,

that was made to be the Star of the East, whether it was like the other stars or perchance
better than they, to be the sign of Him who is the most excellent of all. And if the boasting
of the saints is in their tribulations, since4590 “tribulation worketh patience, and patience
probation, and probation hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,” then the afflicted creation
cannot have the like patience with man, nor the like probation, nor the like hope, but another
degree of these, since4591 “the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on
account of Him who subjected it, for hope.” Now he who shrinks from conferring such
great attributes on man will turn to another direction and say that the creature being subjected
to vanity groans and suffers greater affliction than those who groan in this tabernacle,
for has she not suffered for the utmost extent of time in her service of vanity—nay, many
times as long as man? For why does she do this not willingly, but that it is against her nature
to be subject to vanity, and not to have the best arrangement of her life, that which she shall
receive when she is set free, when the world is destroyed and released even from the vanity
of bodies. Here, however, we may appear to be stretching too far, and aiming at more than
the question now before us requires. We may return, therefore, to the point from which
we set out, and ask for what reason the Saviour is called the light of the world, the true light,
and the light of men. Now we saw that He is called the true light with reference to the
sensible light of the world, and that the light of the world is the same thing as the light of
men, or that we may at least enquire whether they are the same. This discussion is not superfluous.
Some students do not take anything at all out of the statement that the Saviour
is the Word; and it is important for us to assure ourselves that we are not chargeable with
caprice in fixing our attention on that notion. If it admits of being taken in a metaphorical
sense we ought not to take it literally.4592 When we apply the mystical and allegorical
method to the expression “light of the world” and the many analogous terms mentioned
above, we should surely do so with this expression also.</p>

<p>Now He is called the light of men and the true light and the light of the word, because
He brightens and irradiates the higher parts of men, or, in a word, of all reasonable beings.
And similarly it is from and because of the energy with which He causes the old deadness
to be put aside and that which is par excellence life to be put on, so that those who have truly
received Him rise again from the dead, that He is called the resurrection. And this He does
not only at the moment at which a man says,4593 “We are buried with Christ through baptism
and have risen again with Him,” but much rather when a man, having laid off all about him
that belongs to death, walks in the newness of life which belongs to Him, the Son, while
here. We always4594 “carry about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus,” and thus we

is itself sufficient for all the supplies of our journey; and every one who walks on it wants
nothing. He is clad with a garment which is fit for one who is setting out in response to an

better things, even of those who do not hasten to reason (the Logos), but like sheep have a
weakness and gentleness apart from all accuracy and reason, so He is the Shepherd. For

<head>30. Christ as Anointed (Christ) and as King.</head>
<p>In addition to these titles we must consider at the outset of our work that of Christ, and
we must also consider that of King, and compare these two so as to find out the difference
between them. Now it is said in the forty-fourth Psalm,4599 “Thou hast loved righteousness
and hated iniquity, whence Thou art anointed (Christ) above Thy fellows.” His loving
righteousness and hating iniquity were thus added claims in Him; His anointing was not
contemporary with His being nor inherited by Him from the first. Anointing is a symbol
of entering on the kingship, and sometimes also on the priesthood; and must we therefore
conclude that the kingship of the Son of God is not inherited nor congenital to Him? But
how is it conceivable that the First-born of all creation was not a king and became a king
afterwards because He loved righteousness, when, moreover, He Himself was righteousness?
We cannot fail to see that it is as a man that He is Christ, in respect of His soul, which was
human and liable to be troubled and sore vexed, but that He is conceived as king in respect
of the divine in Him. I find support for this in the seventy-first Psalm,4600 which says, “Give
the king Thy judgment, O God, and Thy righteousness to the king’s Son, to judge Thy people
in righteousness and Thy poor in judgment.” This Psalm, though addressed to Solomon,
is evidently a prophecy of Christ, and it is worth while to ask to what king the prophecy
desires judgment to be given by God, and to what king’s Son, and what king’s righteousness
is spoken of. I conceive, then, that what is called the King is the leading nature of the Firstborn
of all creation, to which judgment is given on account of its eminence; and that the
man whom He assumed, formed and moulded by that nature, according to righteousness,
is the King’s Son. I am the more led to think that this is so, because the two beings are here
brought together in one sentence, and are spoken of as if they were not two but one. For
the Saviour made both one,4601 that is, He made them according to the prototype of the
two which had been made one in Himself before all things. The two I refer to human nature,
since each man’s soul is mixed with the Holy Spirit, and each of those who are saved is thus
made spiritual. Now as there are some to whom Christ is a shepherd, as we said before,
because of their meek and composed nature, though they are less guided by reason; so there
are those to whom He is a king, those, namely, who are led in their approach to religion
rather by the reasonable part of their nature. And among those who are under a king there
are differences; some experience his rule in a more mystic and hidden and more divine way,
others in a less perfect fashion. I should say that those who, led by reason, apart from all
agencies of sense, have beheld incorporeal things, the things which Paul speaks of as “invisible,”
or “not seen,” that they are ruled by the leading nature of the Only-begotten, but that

those who have only advanced as far as the reason which is conversant with sensible things,

Christ. No offence need be taken at our distinguishing these notions in the Saviour; we

<p>It is plain to all how our Lord is a teacher and an interpreter for those who are striving
towards godliness, and on the other hand a master of those servants who have the spirit of
bondage to fear,4602 who make progress and hasten towards wisdom, and are found worthy
to possess it. For4603 “the servant knoweth not what the master wills,” since he is no longer
his master, but has become his friend. The Lord Himself teaches this, for He says to hearers
who were still servants:4604 “You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am,”
but in another passage,4605 “I call you no longer servants, for the servant knoweth not what
is the will of his master, but I call you friends,” because4606 “you have continued with Me
in all My temptations.” They, then, who live according to fear, which God exacts from those
who are not good servants, as we read in Malachi,4607 “If I am a Master, where is My fear?”
are servants of a master who is called their Saviour.</p>

<p>None of these testimonies, however, sets forth distinctly the Saviour’s exalted birth; but

this is spoken to Him by God, with whom all time is to-day, for there is no evening with
God, as I consider, and there is no morning, nothing but time that stretches out, along with
His unbeginning and unseen life. The day is to-day with Him in which the Son was begotten,
and thus the beginning of His birth is not found, as neither is the day of it.</p>

<head>33. Christ the True Vine, and as Bread.</head>
<p>To what we have said must be added how the Son is the true vine. Those will have no
difficulty in apprehending this who understand, in a manner worthy of the prophetic grace,
the saying:4609 “Wine maketh glad the heart of man.” For if the heart be the intellectual
part, and what rejoices it is the Word most pleasant of all to drink which takes us off human
things, makes us feel ourselves inspired, and intoxicates us with an intoxication which is
not irrational but divine, that, I conceive, with which Joseph made his brethren merry,4610
then it is very clear how He who brings wine thus to rejoice the heart of man is the true
vine. He is the true vine, because the grapes He bears are the truth, the disciples are His
branches, and they, also, bring forth the truth as their fruit. It is somewhat difficult to show
the difference between the vine and bread, for He says, not only that He is the vine, but that
He is the bread of life. May it be that as bread nourishes and makes strong, and is said to
strengthen the heart of man, but wine, on the contrary, pleases and rejoices and melts him,
so ethical studies, bringing life to him who learns them and reduces them to practice, are
the bread of life, but cannot properly be called the fruit of the vine, while secret and mystical
speculations, rejoicing the heart and causing those to feel inspired who take them in, delighting
in the Lord, and who desire not only to be nourished but to be made happy, are called
the juice of the true vine, because they flow from it.</p>

<head>34. Christ as the First and the Last; He is Also What Lies Between These.</head>
<p>Further, we have to ask in what sense He is called in the Apocalypse the First and the
Last, and how, in His character as the First, He is not the same as the Alpha and the beginning,
while in His character as the Last He is not the same as the Omega and the end. It
appears to me, then, that the reasonable beings which exist are characterized by many forms,
and that some of them are the first, some the second, some the third, and so on to the last.
To pronounce exactly, however, which is the first, what kind of a being the second is, which
may truly be designated third, and to carry this out to the end of the series, this is not a task
for man, but transcends our nature. We shall yet venture, such as we are, to stand still a
little at this point, and to make some observations on the matter. There are some gods of
whom God is god, as we hear in prophecy,4611 “Thank ye the God of gods,” and4612 “The
God of gods hath spoken, and called the earth.” Now God, according to the Gospel,4613 “is
not the God of the dead but of the living.” Those gods, then, are living of whom God is
god. The Apostle, too, writing to the Corinthians, says:4614 “As there are gods many and
lords many,” and so we have spoken of these gods as really existing. Now there are, besides
the gods of whom God is god, certain others, who are called thrones, and others called
dominions, lordships, also, and powers in addition to these. The phrase,4615 “above every
name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come,” leads us to
believe that there are yet others besides these which are less familiar to us; one kind of these
the Hebrews called Sabai, from which Sabaoth was formed, who is their ruler, and is none
other than God. Add to all these the reasonable being who is mortal, man. Now the God
of all things made first in honour some race of reasonable beings; this I consider to be those
who are called gods, and the second order, let us say, for the present, are the thrones, and
the third, undoubtedly, the dominions. And thus we come down in order to the last reasonable
race, which, perhaps, cannot be any other than man. The Saviour accordingly became,
in a diviner way than Paul, all things to all, that He might either gain all or perfect them; it
is clear that to men He became a man, and to the angels an angel. As for His becoming man
no believer has any doubt, but as to His becoming an angel, we shall find reason for believing
it was so, if we observe carefully the appearances and the words of the angels, in some of
which the powers of the angels seem to belong to Him. In several passages angels speak in
such a way as to suggest this, as when4616 “the angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire.

<pb n="587"/>
And he said, I am the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.” But Isaiah also says:4617
“His name is called Angel of Great Counsel.” The Saviour, then, is the first and the last, not
that He is not what lies between, but the extremities are named to show that He became all
things. Consider, however, whether the last is man, or the things said to be under the earth,
of which are the demons, all of them or some. We must ask, too, about those things which
the Saviour became which He speaks of through the prophet David,4618 “And I became as
a man without any to help him, free among the dead.” His birth from the Virgin and His
life so admirably lived showed Him to be more than man, and it was the same among the
dead. He was the only free person there, and His soul was not left in hell. Thus, then, He
is the first and the last. Again, if there be letters of God, as such there are, by reading which
the saints may say they have read what is written on the tablets of heaven, these letters, by
which heavenly things are to be read, are the notions, divided into small parts, into Α and
so on to Ω, the Son of God. Again, He is the beginning and the end, but He is this not in all
His aspects equally. For He is the beginning, as the Proverbs teach us, inasmuch as He is
wisdom; it is written: “The Lord founded Me in the beginning of His ways, for His works.”
In the respect of His being the Logos He is not the beginning. “The Word was in the beginning.”
Thus in His aspects one comes first and is the beginning, and there is a second after
the beginning, and a third, and so on to the end, as if He had said, I am the beginning.
inasmuch as I am wisdom, and the second, perhaps, inasmuch as I am invisible, and the
third in that I am life, for “what was made was life in Him.” One who was qualified to examine
and to discern the sense of Scripture might, no doubt, find many members of the
series; I cannot say if he could find them all. “The beginning and the end” is a phrase we
usually apply to a thing that is a completed unity; the beginning of a house is its foundation
and the end the parapet. We cannot but think of this figure, since Christ is the stone which
is the head of the corner, to the great unity of the body of the saved. For Christ the onlybegotten
Son is all and in all, He is as the beginning in the man He assumed, He is present
as the end in the last of the saints, and He is also in those between, or else He is present as
the beginning in Adam, as the end in His life on earth, according to the saying: “The last
Adam was made a quickening spirit.” This saying harmonizes well with the interpretation
we have given of the first and the last.</p>

<p>In what has been said about the first and the last, and about the beginning and the end,
we have referred these words at one point to the different forms of reasonable beings, at
another to the different conceptions of the Son of God. Thus we have gained a distinction
between the first and the beginning, and between the last and the end, and also the distinctive
meaning of Α and Ω. It is not hard to see why he is called4619 “the Living and the Dead,”
and after being dead He that is alive for evermore. For since we were not helped by His
original life, sunk as we were in sin, He came down into our deadness in order that, He
having died to sin, we,4620 bearing about in our body the dying of Jesus. might then receive
that life of His which is for evermore. For those who always carry about in their body the
dying of Jesus shall obtain the life of Jesus also, manifested in their bodies.</p>

<head>36. Christ as a Sword.</head>
<p>The texts of the New Testament, which we have discussed, are things said by Himself
about Himself. Isaiah, however, He said4621 that His mouth had been set by His Father as
a sharp sword, and that He was hidden under the shadow of His hand, made like to a chosen
shaft and kept close in the Father’s quiver, called His servant by the God of all things, and
Israel, and Light of the Gentiles. The mouth of the Son of God is a sharp sword, for4622
“The word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing
to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts
and intents of the heart.” And indeed He came not to bring peace on the earth, that is, to
corporeal and sensible things, but a sword, and to cut through, if I may say so, the disastrous
friendship of soul and body, so that the soul, committing herself to the spirit which was
against the flesh, may enter into friendship with God. Hence, according to the prophetic
word, He made His mouth as a sword, as a sharp sword. Can any one behold so many
wounded by the divine love, like her in the Song of Songs, who complained that she was
wounded:4623 “I am wounded with love,” and find the dart that wounded so many souls
for the love of God, in any but Him who said, “He hath made Me as a chosen shaft.”</p>

<head>37. Christ as a Servant, as the Lamb of God, and as the Man Whom John Did Not
Know.</head>
<p>Again, let any one consider how Jesus was to His disciples, not as He who sits at meat,
but as He who serves, and how though the Son of God He took on Him the form of a servant
for the sake of the freedom of those who were enslaved in sin, and he will be at no loss to
account for the Father’s saying to Him:4624 “Thou art My servant,” and a little further on:
“It is a great thing that thou shouldst be called My servant.” For we do not hesitate to say
that the goodness of Christ appears in a greater and more divine light, and more according
to the image of the Father, because4625 “He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto
death, even the death of the cross,” than if He had judged it a thing to be grasped to be equal
with God, and had shrunk from becoming a servant for the salvation of the world. Hence
He says,4626 desiring to teach us that in accepting this state of servitude He had received a
great gift from His Father: “And My God shall be My strength. And He said to Me, It is a
great thing for Thee to be called My servant.” For if He had not become a servant, He would
not have raised up the tribes of Jacob, nor have turned the heart of the diaspora of Israel,
and neither would He have become a light of the Gentiles to be for salvation to the ends of
the earth. And it is no great thing for Him to become a servant, even if it is called a great
thing by His Father, for this is in comparison with His being called with an innocent sheep
and with a lamb. For the Lamb of God became like an innocent sheep being led to the
slaughter, that He may take away the sin of the world. He who supplies reason (λογος) to
all is made like a lamb which is dumb before her shearer, that we might be purified by His
death, which is given as a sort of medicine against the opposing power, and also against the
sin of those who open their minds to the truth. For the death of Christ reduced to impotence
those powers which war against the human race, and it set free from sin by a power beyond
our words the life of each believer. Since, then, He takes away sin until every enemy shall
be destroyed and death last of all, in order that the whole world may be free from sin,
therefore John points to Him and says:4627 “Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away
the sin of the world.” It is not said that He will take it away in the future, nor that He is at
present taking it, nor that He has taken it, but is not taking it away now. His taking away
sin is still going on, He is taking it away from every individual in the world, till sin be taken
away from the whole world, and the Saviour deliver the kingdom prepared and completed
to the Father, a kingdom in which no sin is left at all, and which, therefore, is ready to accept
the Father as its king, and which on the other hand is waiting to receive all God has to bestow,

fully, and in every part, at that time when the saying4628 is fulfilled, “That God may be all
in all.” Further, we hear of a man who is said to be coming after John, who was made before
him and was before him. This is to teach us that the man also of the Son of God, the man
who was mixed with His divinity, was older than His birth from Mary. John says he does
not know this man, but must he not have known Him when he leapt for joy when yet a babe
unborn in Elisabeth’s womb, as soon as the voice of Mary’s salutation sounded in the ears
of the wife of Zacharias? Consider, therefore, if the words “I know Him not” may have
reference to the period before the bodily existence. Though he did not know Him before
He assumed His body, yet he knew Him when yet in his mother’s womb, and perhaps he is
here learning something new about Him beyond what was known to him before, namely,
that on whomsoever the Holy Spirit shall descend and abide on him, that is he who is to
baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. He knew him from his mother’s womb, but not
all about Him. He did not know perhaps that this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit
and with fire, when he saw the Spirit descending and abiding on Him. Yet that He was indeed
a man, and the first man, John did not know.</p>

<head>38. Christ as Paraclete, as Propitiation, and as the Power of God.</head>
<p>But none of the names we have mentioned expresses His representation of us with the
Father, as He pleads for human nature, and makes atonement for it; the Paraclete, and the
propitiation, and the atonement. He has the name Paraclete in the Epistle of John:4629 “If
any man sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” And He is
said in the same epistle to be the atonement4630for our sins. Similarly, in the Epistle to the
Romans, He is called a propitiation:4631 “Whom God set forth to be a propitiation through
faith.” Of this proportion there was a type in the inmost part of the temple, the Holy of
Holies, namely, the golden mercy-seat placed upon the two cherubim. But how could He
ever be the Paraclete, and the atonement, and the propitiation without the power of God,
which makes an end of our weakness, flows over the souls of believers, and is administered
by Jesus, who indeed is prior to it and Himself the power of God, who enables a man to
say:4632 “I can do all things through Jesus Christ who strengtheneth me.” Whence we know
that Simon Magus, who gave himself the title of “The power of God, which is called great,”
was consigned to perdition and destruction, he and his money with him. We, on the contrary,
who confess Christ as the true power of God, believe that we share with Him, inasmuch as
He is that power, all things in which any energy resides.</p>

<head>39. Christ as Wisdom and Sanctification and Redemption.</head>
<p>We must not, however, pass over in silence that He is of right the wisdom of God, and
hence is called by that name. For the wisdom of the God and Father of all things does not
apprehend His substance in mere visions, like the phantasms of human thoughts. Whoever
is able to conceive a bodiless existence of manifold speculations which extend to the rationale
of existing things, living and, as it were, ensouled, he will see how well the Wisdom of God
which is above every creature speaks of herself, when she says:4633 “God created me the
beginning of His ways, for His works.” By this creating act the whole creation was enabled
to exist, not being unreceptive of that divine wisdom according to which it was brought into
being; for God, according to the prophet David,4634 made all things in wisdom. But many
things came into being by the help of wisdom, which do not lay hold of that by which they
were created: and few things indeed there are which lay hold not only of that wisdom which
concerns themselves, but of that which has to do with many things besides, namely, of Christ
who is the whole of wisdom. But each of the sages, in proportion as he embraces wisdom,
partakes to that extent of Christ, in that He is wisdom; just as every one who is greatly gifted
with power, in proportion as he has power, in that proportion also has a share in Christ,
inasmuch as He is power. The same is to be thought about sanctification and redemption;
for Jesus Himself is made sanctification to us and redemption. Each of us is sanctified with
that sanctification, and redeemed with that redemption. Consider, moreover, if the words
“to us,” added by the Apostle, have any special force. Christ, he says, “was made to us of
God, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.” In other passages,
he speaks about Christ as being wisdom, without any such qualification, and of His being
power, saying that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God, though we might
have conceived that He was not the wisdom of God or the power of God, absolutely, but
only for us. Now, in respect of wisdom and power, we have both forms of the statement,
the relative and the absolute; but in respect of sanctification and redemption, this is not the
case. Consider, therefore, since4635 “He that sanctifies and they that are sanctified are all
of one,” whether the Father is the sanctification of Him who is our sanctification, as, Christ
being our head, God is His head. But Christ is our redemption because we had become
prisoners and needed ransoming. I do not enquire as to His own redemption, for though
He was tempted in all things as we are, He was without sin, and His enemies never reduced
Him to captivity.</p>

<head>40. Christ as Righteousness; As the Demiurge, the Agent of the Good God, and as
High-Priest.</head>
<p>Having expiscated the “to us” and the “absolutely”—sanctification and redemption being
“to us” and not absolute, wisdom and redemption both to us and absolute—we must not
omit to enquire into the position of righteousness in the same passage. That Christ is
righteousness relatively to us appears clearly from the words: “Who was made to us of God
wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.” And if we do not find Him
to be righteousness absolutely as He is the wisdom and the power of God absolutely, then
we must enquire whether to Christ Himself, as the Father is sanctification, so the Father is
also righteousness. There is, we know, no unrighteousness with God;4636 He is a righteous
and holy Lord,4637 and His judgments are in righteousness, and being righteous, He orders
all things righteously.</p>
<p>The heretics drew a distinction for purposes of their own between the just and the good.
They did not make the matter very clear, but they considered that the demiurge was just,
while the Father of Christ was good. That distinction may, I think, if carefully examined,
be applied to the Father and the Son; the Son being righteousness, and having received
power4638 to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man and will judge the world in
righteousness, but the Father doing good to those who have been disciplined by the righteousness
of the Son. This is after the kingdom of the Son; then the Father will manifest in
His works His name the Good, when God becomes all in all. And perhaps by His righteousness
the Saviour prepares everything at the fit times, and by His word, by His ordering, by
His chastisements, and, if I may use such an expression, by His spiritual healing aids, disposes
all things to receive at the end the goodness of the Father. It was from His sense of that
goodness that He answered him who addressed the Only-begotten with the words “Good
Master,”4639 and said, “Why callest thou Me good? None is good but one, God, the Father.”
This we have treated of elsewhere, especially in dealing with the question of the greater than
the demiurge; Christ we have taken to be the demiurge, and the Father the greater than He.
Such great things, then, He is, the Paraclete, the atonement, the propitiation, the sympathizer
with our weaknesses, who was tempted in all human things, as we are, without sin; and in
consequence He is a great High-Priest, having offered Himself as the sacrifice which is
offered once for all, and not for men only but for every rational creature. For without4640
God He tasted death for every one. In some copies of the Epistle to the Hebrews the words
<note type="footnote">4636 John vii. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">4637 Apoc. xvi. 5, 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">4638 John v. 27.</note>

<note type="footnote">4640 χωρις for χαριτι, a widely diffused early variant.</note>

<pb n="595"/>
are “by the grace of God.” Now, whether He tasted death for every one without God, He
died not for men only but for all other intellectual beings too, or whether He tasted death
for every one by the grace of God, He died for all without God, for by the grace of God He
tasted death for every one. It would surely be absurd to say that He tasted death for human
sins and not for any other being besides man which had fallen into sin, as for example for
the stars. For not even the stars are clean in the eyes of God, as we read in Job,4641 “The
stars are not clean in His sight,” unless this is to be regarded as a hyperbole. Hence he is a
great High-Priest, since He restores all things to His Father’s kingdom, and arranges that
whatever defects exist in each part of creation shall be filled up so as to be full of the glory
of the Father. This High-Priest is called, from some other notion of him than those we have
noticed, Judas, that those who are Jews secretly4642 may take the name of Jew not from
Judah, son of Jacob, but from Him, since they are His brethren, and praise Him for the
freedom they have attained. For it is He who sets them free, saving them from their enemies
on whose backs He lays His hand to subdue them. When He has put under His feet the
opposing power, and is alone in presence of His Father, then He is Jacob and Israel; and
thus as we are made light by Him, since He is the light of the world, so we are made Jacob
since He is called Jacob, and Israel since He is called Israel.</p>

<head>41. Christ as the Rod, the Flower, the Stone.</head>
<p>Now He receives the kingdom from the king whom the children of Israel appointed,
beginning the monarchy not at the divine command and without even consulting God. He
therefore fights the battles of the Lord and so prepares peace for His Son, His people, and
this perhaps is the reason why He is called David. Then He is called a rod;4643 such He is
to those who need a harder and severer discipline, and have not submitted to the love and
gentleness of God. On this account, if He is a rod, He has to “go forth;” He does not remain
in Himself, but appears to go beyond His earlier state. Going forth, then, and becoming a
rod, He does not remain a rod, but after the rod He becomes a flower that rises up, and after
being a rod He is made known as a flower to those who, by His being a rod, have met with
visitation. For “God will visit their iniquities with a rod,”4644 that is, Christ. But “His mercy
He will not take from him,” for He will have mercy on him, for on whom the Son has mercy
the Father has mercy also. An interpretation may be given which makes Him a rod and a
flower in respect of different persons, a rod to those who have need of chastisement, a flower
to those who are being saved; but I prefer the account of the matter given above. We must
add here, however, that, perhaps, looking to the end, if Christ is a rod to any man He is also
a flower to him, while it is not the case that he who receives Him as a flower must also know
Him as a rod. And yet as one flower is more perfect than another and plants are said to
flower, even though they bring forth no perfect fruit, so the perfect receive that of Christ
which transcends the flower. Those, on the other hand, who have known Him as a rod will
partake along with it, not in His perfection, but in the flower which comes before the fruit.
Last of all, before we come to the word Logos, Christ was a stone,4645 set at naught by the
builders but placed on the head of the corner, for the living stones are built up as on a
foundation on the other stones of the Apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself our Lord
being the chief corner-stone, because He is a part of the building made of living stones in
the land of the living; therefore He is called a stone. All this we have said to show how capricious
and baseless is the procedure of those who, when so many names are given to Christ,
take the mere appellation “the Word,” without enquiring, as in the case of His other titles,
in what sense it is used; surely they ought to ask what is meant when it is said of the Son of
God that He was the Word, and God, and that He was in the beginning with the Father,
and that all things were made by Him.</p>

<head>42. Of the Various Ways in Which Christ is the Logos.</head>
<p>As, then, from His activity in enlightening the world whose light He is, Christ is named
the Light of the World, and as from His making those who sincerely attach themselves to
Him put away their deadness and rise again and put on newness of life, He is called the Resurrection,
so from an activity of another kind He is called Shepherd and Teacher, King and
Chosen Shaft, and Servant, and in addition to these Paraclete and Atonement and Propitiation.
And after the same fashion He is also called the Logos,4646 because He takes away
from us all that is irrational, and makes us truly reasonable, so that we do all things, even
to eating and drinking, to the glory of God, and discharge by the Logos to the glory of God
both the commoner functions of life and those which belong to a more advanced stage. For
if, by having part in Him, we are raised up and enlightened, herded also it may be and ruled
over, then it is clear that we become in a divine manner reasonable, when He drives away
from us what in us is irrational and dead, since He is the Logos (reason) and the Resurrection.
Consider, however, whether all men have in some way part in Him in His character as Logos.
On this point the Apostle teaches us that He is to be sought not outside the seeker, and that
those find Him in themselves who set their heart on doing so; “Say not4647 in thy heart,
Who shall ascend into heaven? That is to bring Christ down; or, Who shall descend into
the abyss? That is to bring Christ up from the dead. But what saith the Scripture? The
Word is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart,” as if Christ Himself were the same
thing as the Word said to be sought after. But when the Lord Himself says4648 “If I had not
come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their
sin,” the only sense we can find in His words is that the Logos Himself says that those are
not chargeable with sin to whom He (reason) has not fully come, but that those, if they sin,
are guilty who, having had part in Him, act contrary to the ideas by which He declares His
full presence in us. Only when thus read is the saying true: “If I had not come and spoken
to them, they had not had sin.” Should the words be applied, as many are of opinion that
they should, to the visible Christ, then how is it true that those had no sin to whom He did
not come? In that case all who lived before the advent of the Saviour will be free from sin,
since Jesus, as seen in flesh, had not yet come. And more—all those to whom He has never
been preached will have no sin, and if they have no sin, then it is clear they are not liable to
judgment. But the Logos in man, in which we have said that our whole race had part, is
spoken of in two senses; first, in that of the filling up of ideas which takes place, prodigies
excepted, in every one who passes beyond the age of boyhood, but secondly, in that of the
<note type="footnote">4646 It is impossible to render by any one English word the Greek λογος as used by Origen in the following
discussion. We shall therefore in many passages leave it untranslated.</note>

<note type="footnote">4648 John xv. 22.</note>

<pb n="598"/>
consummation, which takes place only in the perfect. The words, therefore, “If I had not
come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin, but now they have no cloak for
their sin,” are to be understood in the former sense; but the words,4649 “All that ever came
before me are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not hear them,” in the latter. For before
the consummation of reason comes, there is nothing in man but what is blameworthy; all
is imperfect and defective, and can by no means command the obedience of those irrational
elements in us which are tropically spoken of as sheep. And perhaps the former meaning
is to be recognized in the words “The Logos was made flesh,” but the second in “The Logos
was God.” We must accordingly look at what there is to be seen in human affairs between
the saying, “The Word (reason) was made flesh” and “The Word was God.” When the
Word was made flesh can we say that it was to some extent broken up and thinned out, and
can we say that it recovered from that point onward till it became again what it was at first,
God the Word, the Word with the Father; the Word whose glory John saw, the verily onlybegotten,
as from the Father. But the Son may also be the Logos (Word), because He reports
the secret things of His Father who is intellect in the same way as the Son who is called the
Word. For as with us the word is a messenger of those things which the mind perceives, so
the Word of God, knowing the Father, since no created being can approach Him without
a guide, reveals the Father whom He knows. For no one knows the Father save the Son,4650
and he to whomsoever the Son reveals Him, and inasmuch as He is the Word He is the
Messenger of Great Counsel,4651 who has the government upon His shoulders; for He
entered on His kingdom by enduring the cross. In the Apocalypse,4652 moreover, the
Faithful and True (the Word), is said to sit on a white horse, the epithets indicating, I consider,
the clearness of the voice with which the Word of truth speaks to us when He sojourns
among us. This is scarcely the place to show how the word “horse” is often used in passages
spoken for our encouragement in sacred learning. I only cite two of these: “A horse is deceitful
for safety,”4653 and “Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will rejoice
in the name of the Lord our God.”4654 Nor must we leave unnoticed a passage in the forty-
fourth Psalm,4655 frequently quoted by many writers as if they understood it: “My heart
hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King.” Suppose it is God the
Father who speaks thus; what is His heart, that the good word should appear in accordance

<pb n="599"/>
with His heart? If, as these writers suppose, the Word (Logos) needs no interpretation, then
the heart is to be taken in the natural sense too. But it is quite absurd to suppose God’s heart
to be a part of Him as ours is of our body. We must remind such writers that as when the
hand of God is spoken of, and His arm and His finger, we do not read the words literally
but enquire in what sound sense we may take them so as to be worthy of God, so His heart
is to be understood of His rational power, by which He disposes all things, and His word of
that which announces what is in this heart of His. But who is it that announces the counsel
of the Father to those of His creatures who are worthy and who have risen above themselves,
who but the Saviour? That “belched forth” is not, perhaps, without significance; a hundred
other terms might have been employed; “My heart has produced a good word,” it might
have been said, or “My heart has spoken a good word.” But in belching, some wind that
was hidden makes its way out to the world, and so it may be that the Father gives out views
of truth not continuously, but as it were after the fashion of belching, and the word has the
character of the things thus produced, and is called, therefore, the image of the invisible
God. We may enter our agreement, therefore, with the ordinary acceptation of these words,
and take them to be spoken by the Father. It is not, however, a matter of course, that it is
God Himself who announces these things. Why should it not be a prophet? Filled with the
Spirit and unable to contain himself, he brings forth a word about his prophecy concerning
Christ: “My heart hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King, my pen
is the tongue of a ready writer. Excellent in beauty is He beyond the sons of men.” Then
to the Christ Himself: “Grace is poured out on Thy lips.” If the Father were the speaker,
how could He go on after the words, “Grace is poured out on thy lips,” to say, “Therefore
God hath blessed thee for ever,” and a little further on, “Therefore God, thy God, hath
anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” Some of those who wish to make
the Father the speaker may appeal to the words, “Hear, O daughter, and behold and incline
thine ear, and forget thy people and thy father.” The prophet, it may be said, could not address
the Church in the words, “Hear, O daughter.” It is not difficult, however, to show that
changes of person occur frequently in the Psalms, so that these words, “Hear, O daughter,”
might be from the Father, in this passage, though the Psalm as a whole is not. To our discussion
of the Word we may here add the passage,4656 “By the word of the Lord were the
heavens founded, and all the power of them by the breath of His mouth.” Some refer this
to the Saviour and the Holy Spirit. The passage, however, does not necessarily imply any
more than that the heavens were founded by the reason (logos) of God, as when we say that
a house is built by the plan (logos) of the architect, or a ship by the plan (logos) of the shipbuilder.
In the same way the heavens were founded (made solid) by the Word of God, for
<note type="footnote">4656 Ps. xxxiii. 6.</note>

<pb n="600"/>
they are4657 of a more divine substance, which on this account is called solid;4658 it has little
fluidity for the most part, nor is it easily melted like other parts of the world, and specially
the lower parts. On account of this difference the heavens are said in a special manner to
be constituted by the Word of God.</p>
<p>The saying then stands, first, “In the beginning was the Logos;” we are to place that full
in our view; but the testimonies we cited from the Proverbs led us to place wisdom first,
and to think of wisdom as preceding the Word which announces her. We must observe,
then, that the Logos is in the beginning, that is, in wisdom, always. Its being in wisdom,
which is called the beginning, does not prevent it from being with God and from being God,
and it is not simply with God, but is in the beginning, in wisdom, with God. For he goes
on: “He was in the beginning with God.” He might have said, “He was with God;” but as
He was in the beginning, so He was with God in the beginning, and “All things were made
by Him,” being in the beginning, for God made all things, as David tells us, in wisdom. And
to let us understand that the Word has His own definite place and sphere as one who has
life in Himself (and is a distinct person), we must also speak about powers, not about power.
“Thus saith the Lord of powers, (A.V. hosts)” we frequently read; there are certain creatures,
rational and divine, which are called powers: and of these Christ was the highest and best,
and is called not only the wisdom of God but also His power. As, then, there are several
powers of God, each of them in its own form, and the Saviour is different from these, so
also Christ, even if that which is Logos in us is not in respect of form outside of us, will be
understood from our discussion up to this point to be the Logos, who has His being in the
beginning, in wisdom. This for the present may suffice, on the word: “In the beginning
was the Logos.”</p>

<head>1. “And the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”</head>
<p>In the preceding section, my
revered brother Ambrosius, brother formed according to the Gospel, we have discussed, as
far as is at present in our power, what the Gospel is, and what is the beginning in which the
Word was, and what the Word is which was in the beginning. We now come to consider
the next point in the work before us, How the Word was with God. To this end it will be
of service to remember that what is called the Word came to certain persons; as “The Word
of the Lord4659 which came to Hosea, the son of Beeri,” and “The Word4660 which came to
Isaiah, the son of Amos, concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem,” and “The Word
which came to Jeremiah4661 concerning the drought.” We must enquire how this Word
came to Hosea, and how it came also to Isaiah the son of Amos, and again to Jeremiah
concerning the drought; the comparison may enable us to find out how the Word was with
God. The generality will simply look at what the prophets said, as if that were the Word of
the Lord or the Word, that came to them. May it not be, however, that as we say that this
person comes to that, so the Son, the Word, of whom we are now theologizing, came to
Hosea, sent to him by the Father; historically, that is to say, to the son of Beeri, the prophet
Hosea, but mystically to him who is saved, for Hosea means, etymologically, Saved; and to
the son of Beeri, which etymologically means wells, since every one who is saved becomes
a son of that spring which gushes forth out of the depths, the wisdom of God. And it is
nowise marvellous that the saint should be a son of wells. From his brave deeds he is often
called a son, whether, from his works shining before men, of light, or from his possessing
the peace of God which passes all understanding, of peace, or, once more, from the help
which wisdom brings him, a child of wisdom; for wisdom,4662 it says, is justified of her
children. Thus he who by the divine spirit searches all things, and even the deep things of
God, so that he can exclaim,4663 “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the
knowledge of God!” he can be a son of wells, to whom the Word of the Lord comes. Similarly
the Word comes also to Isaiah, teaching the things which are coming upon Judæa and Jerusalem
in the last days; and so also it comes to Jeremiah lifted up by a divine elation. For Iao
means etymologically lifting up, elation. Now the Word comes to men who formerly could
not receive the advent of the Son of God who is the Word; but to God it does not come, as
if it had not been with Him before. The Word was always with the Father; and so it is said,

“And the Word was with God.” He did not come to God, and this same word “was” is used
of the Word because He was in the beginning at the same time when He was with God,
neither being separated from the beginning nor being bereft of His Father. And again,
neither did He come to be in the beginning after He had not been in it, nor did He come to
be with God after not having been with Him. For before all time and the remotest age4664
the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God. Thus to find out what is meant
by the phrase, “The Word was with God,” we have adduced the words used about the
prophets, how He came to Hosea, to Isaiah, to Jeremiah, and we have noticed the difference,
by no means accidental, between “became” and “was.” We have to add that in His coming
to the prophets He illuminates the prophets with the light of knowledge, causing them to
see things which had been before them, but which they had not understood till then. With
God, however, He is God, just because He is with Him. And perhaps it was because he saw
some such order in the Logos, that John did not place the clause “The Word was God” before
the clause “The Word was with God.” The series in which he places his different sentences
does not prevent the force of each axiom from being separately and fully seen. One axiom
is, “In the beginning was the Word,” a second, “The Word was with God,” and then comes,
“And the Word was God.” The arrangement of the sentences might be thought to indicate
an order; we have first “In the beginning was the Word,” then, “And the Word was with
God,” and thirdly, “And the Word was God,” so that it might be seen that the Word being
with God makes Him God.</p>

<head>2. In What Way the Logos is God. Errors to Be Avoided on This Question.</head>
<p>We next notice John’s use of the article in these sentences. He does not write without
care in this respect, nor is he unfamiliar with the niceties of the Greek tongue. In some cases
he uses the article, and in some he omits it. He adds the article to the Logos, but to the name
of God he adds it sometimes only. He uses the article, when the name of God refers to the
uncreated cause of all things, and omits it when the Logos is named God. Does the same
difference which we observe between God with the article and God without it prevail also
between the Logos with it and without it? We must enquire into this. As the God who is
over all is God with the article not without it, so “the Logos” is the source of that reason
(Logos) which dwells in every reasonable creature; the reason which is in each creature is
not, like the former called par excellence The Logos. Now there are many who are sincerely
concerned about religion, and who fall here into great perplexity. They are afraid that they
may be proclaiming two Gods, and their fear drives them into doctrines which are false and
wicked. Either they deny that the Son has a distinct nature of His own besides that of the
Father, and make Him whom they call the Son to be God all but the name, or they deny the
divinity of the Son, giving Him a separate existence of His own, and making His sphere of
essence fall outside that of the Father, so that they are separable from each other. To such
persons we have to say that God on the one hand is Very God (Autotheos, God of Himself);
and so the Saviour says in His prayer to the Father,4665 “That they may know Thee the only
true God;” but that all beyond the Very God is made God by participation in His divinity,
and is not to be called simply God (with the article), but rather God (without article). And
thus the first-born of all creation, who is the first to be with God, and to attract to Himself
divinity, is a being of more exalted rank than the other gods beside Him, of whom God is
the God, as it is written,4666 “The God of gods, the Lord, hath spoken and called the earth.”
It was by the offices of the first-born that they became gods, for He drew from God in generous
measure that they should be made gods, and He communicated it to them according
to His own bounty. The true God, then, is “The God,” and those who are formed after Him
are gods, images, as it were, of Him the prototype. But the archetypal image, again, of all
these images is the Word of God, who was in the beginning, and who by being with God is
at all times God, not possessing that of Himself, but by His being with the Father, and not
continuing to be God, if we should think of this, except by remaining always in uninterrupted
contemplation of the depths of the Father.</p>

<head>3. Various Relations of the Logos to Men.</head>
<p>Now it is possible that some may dislike what we have said representing the Father as
the one true God, but admitting other beings besides the true God, who have become gods
by having a share of God. They may fear that the glory of Him who surpasses all creation
may be lowered to the level of those other beings called gods. We drew this distinction
between Him and them that we showed God the Word to be to all the other gods the minister
of their divinity. To this we must add, in order to obviate objections, that the reason
which is in every reasonable creature occupied the same relation to the reason who was in
the beginning with God, and is God the Word, as God the Word occupies to God. As the
Father who is Very God and the True God is to His image and to the images of His image—
men are said to be according to the image, not to be images of God—so He, the Word,
is to the reason (word) in every man. Each fills the place of a fountain—the Father is the
fountain of divinity, the Son of reason. As, then, there are many gods, but to us there is but
one God the Father, and many Lords, but to us there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, so there are
many Λόγοι, but we, for our part, pray that that one Λόγος may be with us who was in the
beginning and was with God, God the Logos. For whoever does not receive this Logos who
was in the beginning with God, or attach himself to Him as He appeared in flesh, or take
part in some of those who had part in this Logos, or whoever having had part in Him falls
away from Him again, he will have his portion in what is called most opposite to reason.
What we have drawn out from the truths with which we started will now be clear enough.
First, we spoke about God and the Word of God, and of Gods, either, that is, beings who
partake in deity or beings who are called Gods and are not. And again of the Logos of God
and of the Logos of God made flesh, and of logoi, or beings which partake in some way of
the Logos, of second logoi or of third, thought to be logoi, in addition to that Logos that
was before them all, but not really so. Irrational Reasons these may be styled; beings are
spoken of who are said to be Gods but are not, and one might place beside these Gods who
are no Gods, Reasons which are no Reasons. Now the God of the universe is the God of the
elect, and in a much greater degree of the Saviours of the elect; then He is the God of these
beings who are truly Gods, and then He is the God, in a word, of the living and not of the
dead. But God the Logos is the God, perhaps, of those who attribute everything to Him and
who consider Him to be their Father. Now the sun and the moon and the stars were connected,
according to the accounts of men of old times, with beings who were not worthy to
have the God of gods counted their God. To this opinion they were led by a passage in
Deuteronomy which is somewhat on this wise:4667 “Lest when thou liftest up thine eyes to
heaven, and seest the sun and the moon and the whole host of heaven, thou wander away
and worship them and serve them which the Lord thy God hath appointed to all the peoples.
<note type="footnote">4667 Deut. iv. 19, quoted apparently from memory.</note>

<pb n="605"/>
But to you the Lord thy God hath not so given them.” But how did God appoint the sun
and the moon and all the host of heaven to all the nations, if He did not give them in the
same way to Israel also, to the end that those who could not rise to the realm of intellect,
might be inclined by gods of sense to consider about the Godhead, and might of their own
free will connect themselves with these and so be kept from falling away to idols and demons?
Is it not the case that some have for their God the God of the universe, while a second class,
after these, attach themselves to the Son of God, His Christ, and a third class worship the
sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, wandering, it is true, from God, but with a far
different and a better wandering than that of those who invoke as gods the works of men’s
hands, silver and gold,—works of human skill. Last of all are those who devote themselves
to the beings which are called gods but are no gods. In the same way, now, some have faith
in that Reason which was in the beginning and was with God and was God; so did Hosea
and Isaiah and Jeremiah and others who declared that the Word of the Lord, or the Logos,
had come to them. A second class are those who know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him
crucified, considering that the Word made flesh is the whole Word, and knowing only Christ
after the flesh. Such is the great multitude of those who are counted believers. A third class
give themselves to logoi (discourses) having some part in the Logos which they consider
superior to all other reason: these are they who follow the honourable and distinguished
philosophical schools among the Greeks. A fourth class besides these are they who put their
trust in corrupt and godless discourses, doing away with Providence, which is so manifest
and almost visible, and who recognize another end for man to follow than the good. It may
appear to some that we have wandered from our theme, but to my thinking the view we
have reached of four things connected with the name of God and four things connected
with the Logos comes in very well at this point. There was God with the article and God
without the article, then there were gods in two orders, at the summit of the higher order
of whom is God the Word, transcended Himself by the God of the universe. And, again,
there was the Logos with the article and the Logos without the article, corresponding to God
absolutely and a god; and the Logoi in two ranks. And some men are connected with the
Father, being part of Him, and next to these, those whom our argument now brings into
clearer light, those who have come to the Saviour and take their stand entirely in Him. And
third are those of whom we spoke before, who reckon the sun and the moon and the stars
to be gods, and take their stand by them. And in the fourth and last place those who submit
to soulless and dead idols. To all this we find analogies in what concerns the Logos. Some
are adorned with the Word Himself; some with what is next to Him and appears to be the
very original Logos Himself, those, namely, who know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him
crucified, and who behold the Word as flesh. And the third class, as we described them a
little before. Why should I speak of those who are thought to be in the Logos, but have

<pb n="606"/>
fallen away, not only from the good itself, but from the very traces of it and from those who
have a part in it?</p>

<p>4. That the Logos is One, Not Many. Of the Word, Faithful and True, and of His
White Horse.</p>
<p>“He was in the beginning with God.” By his three foregoing propositions the Evangelist
has made us acquainted with three orders, and he now sums up the three in one, saying,
“This (Logos) was in the beginning with God.” In the first premiss we learned where the
Logos was: He was in the beginning; then we learned with whom He was, with God; and
then who He was, that He was God. He now points out by this word “He,” the Word who
is God, and gathers up into a fourth proposition the three which went before, “In the beginning
was the Word,” “The Word was with God,” and “The Word was God.” Now he says,
He, this (Word) was in the beginning with God. The term beginning may be taken of the
beginning of the world, so that we may learn from what is said that the Word was older
than the things which were made from the beginning. For if “in the beginning God created
heaven and earth,” but “He” was in the beginning, then the Logos is manifestly older than
those things which were made at the beginning, older not only than the firmament and the
dry land, but than the heavens and earth. Now some one might ask, and not unreasonably,
why it is not said, “In the beginning was the Word of God, and the Word of God was with
God, and the Word of God was God.” But he who asked such a question could be shown
to be taking for granted that there are a plurality of logoi, differing perhaps from each other
in kind, one being the word of God, another perhaps the word of angels, a third of men,
and so on with the other logoi. Now, if this were so with the Logos, the case would be the
same with wisdom and with righteousness. But it would be absurd that there should be a
number of things equally to be called “The Word;” and the same would apply to wisdom
and to righteousness. We shall be driven to confess that we ought not to look for a plurality
of logoi, or of wisdom, or of righteousness, if we look at the case of truth. Any one will
confess that there is only one truth; it could never be said in this case that there is one truth
of God, and another of the angels, and another of man,—it lies in the nature of things that
the truth about anything is one. Now, if truth be one, it is clear that the preparation of it
and its demonstration, which is wisdom, must in reason be conceived as one, since what is
regarded as wisdom cannot justly claim that title where truth, which is one, is absent from
its grasp. But if truth is one and wisdom one, then Reason (Logos) also, which announces
truth and makes truth simple and manifest to those who are fitted to receive it, will be one.
This we say, by no means denying that truth and wisdom and reason are of God, but we
wish to indicate the purpose of the omission in this passage of the words “of God,” and of
the form of the statement, “In the beginning the Logos was with God.” The same John in
the Apocalypse gives Him His name with the addition “of God,” where he says:4668 “And
I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat thereon called Faithful and
<note type="footnote">4668 Apoc. xix. 11–16.</note>

<pb n="608"/>
True; and in righteousness doth He judge and make war. And His eyes are as a flame of
fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He hath a name written which no one knoweth
but He Himself. And He is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood, and His name is
called4669 Word of God. And His armies in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed
in pure fine linen. And out of His mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it He should
smite the nations, and He shall rule them with a rod of iron, and He treadeth the winepress
of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God. And He hath on His garment and on His
thigh a name written: King of kings, and Lord of lords.” In this passage Logos is necessarily
spoken of absolutely without the article, and also with the addition Logos of God; had the
first not been the case (i.e., had the article been given) we might have been led to take up
the meaning wrongly,4670 and so to depart from the truth about the Logos. For if it had
been called simply Logos, and had not been said to be the Logos of God, then we would not
be clearly informed that the Logos is the Logos of God. And, again, had it been called Logos
of God but not said to be Logos absolutely, then we might imagine many logoi, according
to the constitution of each of the rational beings which exist; then we might assume a
number of logoi properly so called. Again, in his description in the Apocalypse of the Logos
of God, the Apostle and Evangelist (and the Apocalypse entitles him to be styled a prophet,
too) says he saw the Word of God in the opened heaven, and that He was riding on a white
horse. Now we must consider what he means to convey when he speaks of heaven being
opened and of the white horse, and of the Word of God riding on the white horse, and also
what is meant by saying that the Word of God is Faithful and True, and that in righteousness
He judges and makes war. All this will greatly advance our study on the subject of the Word
of God. Now I conceive heaven to have been shut against the ungodly, and those who bear
the image of the earthly, and to have been opened to the righteous and those adorned with
the image of the heavenly. For to the former, being below and still dwelling in the flesh, the
better things are closed, since they cannot understand them and have neither power nor
will to see their beauty, looking down as they do and not striving to look up. But to the excellent,
or those who have their commonwealth in heaven,4671 he opens, with the key of
David, the things in heavenly places and discloses them to their view, and makes all clear
to them by riding on his horse. These words also have their meaning; the horse is white
because it is the nature of higher knowledge (γνῶσις) to be clear and white and full of light.
And on the white horse sits He who is called Faithful, seated more firmly, and so to speak
more royally, on words which cannot be set aside, words which run sharply and more swiftly
than any horse, and overhear in their rushing course every so-called word that simulates
<note type="footnote">4669 In the Greek the article is here omitted.</note>
<note type="footnote">4670 Reading παρεκδέξασθαι, with Huet.</note>
<note type="footnote">4671 Philipp. iii. 20.</note>

<pb n="609"/>
the Word, and every so-called truth that simulates the Truth. He who sits on the white
horse is called Faithful, not because of the faith He cherishes, but of that which He inspires,
because He is worthy of faith. Now the Lord Jehovah, according to Moses,4672 is Faithful
and True. He is true also in respect of His relation to shadow, type, and image; for such is
the Word who is in the opened heaven, for He is not on earth as He is in heaven; on earth
He is made flesh and speaks through shadow, type, and image. The multitude, therefore,
of those who are reputed to believe are disciples of the shadow of the Word, not of the true
Word of God which is in the opened heaven. Hence Jeremiah says,4673 “The Spirit of our
face is Christ the Lord, of whom we said, In His shadow shall we live among the nations.”
Thus the Word of God who is called Faithful is also called True, and in righteousness He
judges and makes war; since He has received from God the faculty of judging in very righteousness
and very judgment, and of apportioning its due to every existing creature. For
none of those who have some portion of righteousness and of the faculty of judgment can
receive on his soul such copies and impressions of righteousness and judgment as to come
short in no point of absolute righteousness and absolute justice, just as no painter of a picture
can communicate to the representation all the qualities of the original. This, I conceive, is
the reason why David says,4674 “Before Thee shall no living being be justified.” He does
not say, no man, or no angel, but no living being, since even if any being partakes of life and
has altogether put off mortality, not even then can it be justified in comparison of Thee,
who art, as it were, Life itself. Nor is it possible that one who partakes of life and is therefore
called living, should become life itself, or that one who partakes of righteousness and,
therefore, is called righteous should become equal to righteousness itself. Now it is the
function of the Word of God, not only to judge in righteousness, but also to make war in
righteousness, that by making war on His enemies by reason and righteousness, so that
what is irrational and wicked is destroyed,4675 He may dwell in the soul of him who, for his
salvation, so to speak, has become captive to Christ, and may justify that soul and cast out
from her all adversaries. We shall, however, obtain a better view of this war which the Word
carries on if we remember that He is an ambassador for the truth, while there is another
who pretends to be the Word and is not, and one who calls herself the truth and is not, but
a lie. Then the Word, arming Himself against the lie, slays it with the breath of His mouth
and brings it to naught by the manifestation of His coming.4676 And consider whether
these words of the Apostle to the Thessalonians may be understood in an intellectual sense.
<note type="footnote">4672 Deut. xxxii. 4.</note>

<pb n="610"/>
For what is that which is destroyed by the breath of the mouth of Christ, Christ being the
Word and Truth and Wisdom, but the lie? And what is that which is brought to naught by
the manifestation of Christ’s coming, Christ being conceived as wisdom and reason, what
but that which announces itself as wisdom, when in reality it is one of those things with
which God deals as the Apostle describes,4677 “He taketh the wise, those who are not wise
with the true wisdom, in their own craftiness”? To what he says of the rider on the white
horse, John adds the wonderful statement: “His eyes are like a flame of fire.” For as the
flame of fire is bright and illuminating, but at the same time fiery and destructive of material
things, so, if I may so say, are the eyes of the Logos with which He sees, and every one
who has part in Him; they have not only the inherent quality of laying hold of the things of
the mind, but also that of consuming and putting away those conceptions which are more
material and gross, since whatever is in any way false flees from the directness and lightness
of truth. It is in a very natural order that after speaking of Him who judges in righteousness
and makes war in accordance with His righteous judgments, and then after His warring of
His giving light, the writer goes on to say, “On His head are many diadems.” For had the
lie been one, and of one form only, against which the True and Faithful Word contended,
and for conquering which, He was crowned, then one crown alone would naturally have
been given Him for the victory. As it is, however, as the lies are many which profess the
truth and for warring against which the Word is crowned, the diadems are many which
surround the head of the conqueror of them all. As He has overcome every revolting power
many diadems mark His victory. Then after the diadems He is said to have a name written
which no one knows but He Himself. For there are some things which are known to the
Word alone; for the beings which come into existence after Him have a poorer nature than
His, and none of them is able to behold all that He apprehends. And perhaps it is the case
that only those who have part in that Word know the things which are kept from the
knowledge of those who do not partake of Him. Now, in John’s vision, the Word of God
as He rides on the white horse is not naked: He is clothed with a garment sprinkled with
blood, for the Word who was made flesh and therefore died is surrounded with marks of
the fact that His blood was poured out upon the earth, when the soldier pierced His side.
For of that passion, even should it be our lot some day to come to that highest and supreme
contemplation of the Logos, we shall not lose all memory, nor shall we forget the truth that
our admission was brought about by His sojourning in our body. This Word of God is
followed by the heavenly armies one and all; they follow the Word as their leader, and imitate
Him in all things, and chiefly in having mounted, they also, white horses. To him that understands,
this secret is open. And as sorrow and grief and wailing fled away at the end of
things, so also, I suppose, did obscurity and doubt, all the mysteries of God’s wisdom being
<note type="footnote">4677 1 Cor. iii. 19.</note>

<pb n="611"/>
precisely and clearly opened. Look also at the white horses of the followers of the Word
and at the white and pure linen with which they were clothed. As linen comes out of the
earth, may not those linen garments stand for the dialects on the earth in which those voices
are clothed which make clear announcements of things? We have dealt at some length with
the statements found in the Apocalypse about the Word of God; it is important for us to
know clearly about Him.</p>

<head>5. He (This One) Was in the Beginning with God.</head>
<p>To those who fail to distinguish with care the different propositions of the context the
Evangelist may appear to be repeating himself. “He was in the beginning with God” may
seem to add nothing to “And the Word was with God.” We must observe more carefully.
In the statement “The Word was with God” we are not told anything of the when or the
where; that is added in the fourth axiom. There are four axioms, or, as some call them,
propositions, the fourth being “He was in the beginning with God.” Now “The Word was
with God” is not the same thing as “He was,” etc.; for here we are told, not only that He was
with God, but when and where He was so: “He was in the beginning with God.” The “He,”
too, used as it is for a demonstration, will be considered to refer to the Word, or by a less
careful enquirer, to God. What was noted before is now summed up in this designation
“He,” the notion of the Logos and that of God; and as the argument proceeds the different
notions are collected in one; for the notion God is not included in the notion Logos, nor
the notion Logos in that of God. And perhaps the proposition before us is a summing up
in one of the three which have preceded. Taking the statement that the Word was in the
beginning, we have not yet learned that He was with God, and taking the statement that the
Word was with God it is not yet clear to us that He was with God in the beginning; and
taking the statement that the Word was God, it has neither been shown that He was in the
beginning, nor that He was with God.</p>
<p>Now when the Evangelist says, “He was in the beginning with God,” if we apply the
pronoun “He” to the Word and to God (as He is God) and consider that “in the beginning”
is conjoined with it, and “with God” added to it, then there is nothing left of the three propositions
that is not summed up and brought together in this one. And as “in the beginning”
has been said twice, we may consider if there are not two lessons we may learn. First, that
the Word was in the beginning, as if He was by Himself and not with any one, and secondly,
that He was in the beginning with God. And I consider that there is nothing untrue in
saying of Him both that He was in the beginning, and in the beginning with God, for neither
was He with God alone, since He was also in the beginning, nor was He in the beginning
alone and not with God, since “He was in the beginning with God.”</p>

<head>6. How the Word is the Maker of All Things, and Even the Holy Spirit Was Made
Through Him.</head>
<p>“All things were made through Him.” The “through4678 whom” is never found in the
first place but always in the second, as in the Epistle to the Romans,4679 “Paul a servant of
Christ Jesus, a called Apostle, separated to the Gospel of God which He promised before by
His prophets in Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David
according to the flesh, determined the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness,
by the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we received grace
and apostleship, for obedience of the faith among all the nations, for His name’s sake.” For
God promised aforehand by the prophets His own Gospel, the prophets being His ministers,
and having their word to speak about Him “through whom.” And again God gave grace
and apostleship to Paul and to the others for the obedience of the faith among all the nations,
and this He gave them through Jesus Christ the Saviour, for the “through whom” belonged
to Him. And the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Hebrews:4680 “At the end of the
days He spoke to us in His Son, whom He made the heir of all things, ‘through whom’ also
He made the ages,” showing us that God made the ages through His Son, the “through
whom” belonging, when the ages were being made, to the Only-begotten. Thus, if all things
were made, as in this passage also, through the Logos, then they were not made by the Logos,
but by a stronger and greater than He. And who else could this be but the Father? Now if,
as we have seen, all things were made through Him, we have to enquire if the Holy Spirit
also was made through Him. It appears to me that those who hold the Holy Spirit to be
created, and who also admit that “all things were made through Him,” must necessarily assume
that the Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos accordingly being older
than He. And he who shrinks from allowing the Holy Spirit to have been made through
Christ must, if he admits the truth of the statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be
uncreated. There is a third resource besides these two (that of allowing the Spirit to have
been made by the Word, and that of regarding it as uncreated), namely, to assert that the
Holy Spirit has no essence of His own beyond the Father and the Son. But on further thought
one may perhaps see reason to consider that the Son is second beside the Father, He being
the same as the Father, while manifestly a distinction is drawn between the Spirit and the
Son in the passage,4681 “Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be
forgiven him, but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness,
either in this world or in the world to come.” We consider, therefore, that there
<note type="footnote">4678 See R.V. margin, John i. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">4679 Rom. i. 1–5.</note>
<note type="footnote">4680 i. 1, 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">4681 Matt. xii. 32.</note>

<pb n="614"/>
are three hypostases, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; and at the same time we
believe nothing to be uncreated but the Father. We therefore, as the more pious and the
truer course, admit that all things were made by the Logos, and that the Holy Spirit is the
most excellent and the first in order4682 of all that was made by the Father through Christ.
And this, perhaps, is the reason why the Spirit is not said to be God’s own Son. The Onlybegotten
only is by nature and from the beginning a Son, and the Holy Spirit seems to have
need of the Son, to minister to Him His essence, so as to enable Him not only to exist, but
to be wise and reasonable and just, and all that we must think of Him as being. All this He
has by participation of the character of Christ, of which we have spoken above. And I consider
that the Holy Spirit supplies to those who, through Him and through participation in
Him, are called saints, the material of the gifts, which come from God; so that the said material
of the gifts is made powerful by God, is ministered by Christ, and owes its actual existence
in men to the Holy Spirit. I am led to this view of the charisms by the words of Paul
which he writes somewhere,4683 “There are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, and diversities
of ministrations, and the same Lord. And there are diversities of workings, but it
is the same God that worketh all in all.” The statement that all things were made by Him,
and its seeming corollary, that the Spirit must have been called into being by the Word, may
certainly raise some difficulty. There are some passages in which the Spirit is placed above
Christ; in Isaiah, for example, Christ declares that He is sent, not by the Father only, but
also by the Holy Spirit. “Now the Lord hath sent Me,” He says,4684 “and His Spirit,” and in
the Gospel He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed against Himself, but
that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there is no forgiveness, either in this age or in
the age to come. What is the reason of this? Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value
than Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven? May it not rather be that all rational
beings have part in Christ, and that forgiveness is extended to them when they repent of
their sins, while only those have part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of it,
and that there cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall away to evil in spite of such
great and powerful cooperation, and who defeat the counsels of the Spirit who is in them.
When we find the Lord saying, as He does in Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by
His Spirit, we have to point out here also that the Spirit is not originally superior to the Saviour,
but that the Saviour takes a lower place than He in order to carry out the plan which
has been made that the Son of God should become man. Should any one stumble at our
saying that the Saviour in becoming man was made lower than the Holy Spirit, we ask him
to consider the words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews,4685 where Jesus is shown by Paul
<note type="footnote">4682 Reading πρὸ πάυτων, with Jacobi.</note>

<pb n="615"/>
to have been made less than the angels on account of the suffering of death. “We behold
Him,” he says, “who hath been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the
suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.” And this, too, has doubtless to be added,
that the creation, in order to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and not least of
all the human race, required the introduction into human nature of a happy and divine
power, which should set right what was wrong upon the earth, and that this action fell to
the share, as it were, of the Holy Spirit; but the Spirit, unable to support such a task, puts
forward the Saviour as the only one able to endure such a conflict. The Father therefore,
the principal, sends the Son, but the Holy Spirit also sends Him and directs Him to go before,
promising to descend, when the time comes, to the Son of God, and to work with Him for
the salvation of men. This He did, when, in a bodily shape like a dove, He flew to Him after
the baptism. He remained on Him, and did not pass Him by, as He might have done with
men not able continuously to bear His glory. Thus John, when explaining how he knew
who Christ was, spoke not only of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its remaining
upon him. For it is written that John said:4686 “He who sent me to baptize said, On
whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He
that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.” It is not said only, “On whomsoever thou
shalt see the Spirit descending,” for the Spirit no doubt descended on others too, but “descending
and abiding on Him.” Our examination of this point has been somewhat extended,
since we were anxious to make it clear that if all things were made by Him, then the Spirit
also was made through the Word, and is seen to be one of the “all things” which are inferior
to their Maker. This view is too firmly settled to be disturbed by a few words which may
be adduced to the opposite effect. If any one should lend credence to the Gospel according
to the Hebrews, where the Saviour Himself says, “My mother, the Holy Spirit took me just
now by one of my hairs and carried me off to the great mount Tabor,” he will have to face
the difficulty of explaining how the Holy Spirit can be the mother of Christ when it was itself
brought into existence through the Word. But neither the passage nor this difficulty is hard
to explain. For if he who does the will of the Father in heaven4687 is Christ’s brother and
sister and mother, and if the name of brother of Christ may be applied, not only to the race
of men, but to beings of diviner rank than they, then there is nothing absurd in the Holy
Spirit’s being His mother, every one being His mother who does the will of the Father in
heaven.</p>
<p>On the words, “All things were made by Him,” there is still one point to be examined.
The “word” is, as a notion, from “life,” and yet we read, “What was made in the Word was
life, and the life was the light of men.” Now as all things were made through Him, was the
<note type="footnote">4686 John i. 32.</note>

<pb n="616"/>
life made through Him, which is the light of men, and the other notions under which the
Saviour is presented to us? Or must we take the “all things were made by Him” subject to
the exception of the things which are in Himself? The latter course appears to be the
preferable one. For supposing we should concede that the life which is the light of men was
made through Him, since it said that the life “was made” the light of men, what are we to
say about wisdom, which is conceived as being prior to the Word? That, therefore, which
is about the Word (His relations or conditions) was not made by the Word, and the result
is that, with the exception of the notions under which Christ is presented, all things were
made through the Word of God, the Father making them in wisdom. “In wisdom hast Thou
made them all,” it says,4688 not through, but in wisdom.</p>

<head>7. Of Things Not Made Through the Logos.</head>
<p>Let us see, however, why the words are added, “And without Him was not anything
(Gr. even one thing) made.” Some might think it superfluous to add to the words “All things
were made through Him,” the phrase “Without Him was not anything made.” For if
everything whatsoever was made through the Logos, then nothing was made without Him.
Yet it does not follow from the proposition that without the Logos nothing was made, that
all things were made through the Logos. It is possible that though nothing was made without
the Logos, all things were made, not through the Logos only, but some things by Him. We
must, therefore, make ourselves sure in what sense the “all things” is to be understood, and
in what sense the “nothing.” For, without a clear preliminary definition of these terms, it
might be maintained that, if all things were made through the Logos, and evil is a part of all
things, then the whole matter of sin, and everything that is wicked, that these also were made
through the Logos. But this we must regard as false. There is nothing absurd in thinking
that creatures were made through the Logos, and also that men’s brave deeds have been
done through Him, and all the useful acts of those who are now in bliss; but with the sins
and misfortunes of men it is otherwise. Now some have held that since evil is not based in
the constitution of things—for it did not exist at the beginning and at the end it will have
ceased—that, therefore, the evils of which we spoke are the Nothing; and as some of the
Greeks say that genera and forms, such as the (general) animal and the man, belong to the
category of Nothings, so it has been supposed that all that is not of God is Nothing, and has
not even obtained through the Word the subsistence it appears to have. We ask whether it
is possible to show from Scripture in any convincing way that this is so. As for the meanings
of the word “Nothing” and “Not-being,” they would appear to be synonymous, for Nothing
can be spoken of as Not-being, and the Not-being can be described as Nothing. The Apostle,
however, appears to count the things which are not, not among those which have no existence
whatever, but rather among things which are evil. To him the Not-being is evil; “God,” he
says,4689 “called the things that are not as things that are.” And Mardochæus, too, in the
Esther of the Septuagint, calls the enemies of Israel “those that are not,” saying,4690 “Deliver
not Thy sceptre, O Lord, to those that are not.” We may also notice how evil men, on account
of their wickedness, are said not to be, from the name ascribed to God in Exodus:4691 “For
the Lord said to Moses, I am, that is My name.” The good God says this with respect of us
also who pray that we may be part of His congregation. The Saviour praises him, saying,4692
“None is good but one, God the Father.” The good, then, is the same as He who is. Over

<pb n="618"/>
against good is evil or wickedness, and over against Him who is that which is not, whence
it follows that evil and wickedness are that which is not. This, perhaps, is what has led some
to affirm that the devil is not created by God. In respect that he is the devil he is not the
work of God, but he who is the devil is a created being, and as there is no other creator but
our God, he is a work of God. It is as if we should say that a murderer is not a work of God,
while we may say that in respect he is a man, God made him. His being as a man he received
from God; we do not assert that he received from God his being as a murderer. All, then,
who have part in Him who is, and the saints have part in Him, may properly be called Beings;
but those who have given up their part in the Being, by depriving themselves of Being, have
become Not-beings. But we said when entering on this discussion, that Not-being and
Nothing are synonymous, and hence those who are not beings are Nothing, and all evil is
nothing, since it is Not-being, and thus since they are called Not-being came into existence
without the Logos, not being numbered among the all things which were made through
Him. Thus we have shown, so far as our powers admit, what are the “all things” which were
made through the Logos, and what came into existence without Him, since at no time is it
Being, and it is, therefore, called “Nothing.”</p>

<head>8. Heracleon’s View that the Logos is Not the Agent of Creation.</head>
<p>It was, I consider, a violent and unwarranted procedure which was adopted by Heracleon,
4693 the friend, as it is said, of Valentinus, in discussing this sentence: “All things were
made through Him.” He excepted the whole world and all that it contains, excluding, as
far as his hypothesis goes, from the “all things” what is best in the world and its contents.
For he says that the æon (age), and the things in it, were not made by the Logos; he considers
them to have come into existence before the Logos. He deals with the statement, “Without
Him was nothing made,” with some degree of audacity, nor is he afraid of the warning:4694
“Add not to His words, lest He find thee out and thou prove a liar,” for to the “Nothing” he
adds: “Of what is in the world and the creation.” And as his statements on the passage are
obviously very much forced and in the face of the evidence, for what he considers divine is
excluded from the all, and what he regards as purely evil is, that and nothing else, the all
things, we need not waste our time in rebutting what is, on the face of it, absurd, when,
without any warrant from Scripture, he adds to the words, “Without Him was nothing
made,” the further words, “Of what is in the earth and the creation.” In this proposal, which
has no inner probability to recommend it, he is asking us, in fact, to trust him as we do the
prophets, or the Apostles, who had authority and were not responsible to men for the writings
belonging to man’s salvation, which they handed to those about them and to those who
should come after. He had, also, a private interpretation of his own of the words: “All things
were made through Him,” when he said that it was the Logos who caused the demiurge to
make the world, not, however, the Logos from whom or by whom, but Him through whom,
taking the written words in a different sense from that of common parlance.4695 For, if the
truth of the matter was as he considers, then the writer ought to have said that all things
were made through the demiurge by the Word, and not through the Word by the demiurge.
We accept the “through whom,” as it is usually understood, and have brought evidence in
support of our interpretation, while he not only puts forward a new rendering of his own,
unsupported by the divine Scripture, but appears even to scorn the truth and shamelessly
and openly oppose it. For he says: “It was not the Logos who made all things, as under
another who was the operating agent,” taking the “through whom” in this sense, “but another
made them, the Logos Himself being the operating agent.” This is not a suitable occasion
for the proof that it was not the demiurge who became the servant of the Logos and made
the world; but that the Logos became the servant of the demiurge and formed the world.

For, according to the prophet David,4696 “God spake and they came into being, He commanded

made through Him and unto Him, and He is before all things.”</p>

<head>9. That the Logos Present in Us is Not Responsible for Our Sins.</head>
<p>One point more on the words: “Without Him was not anything made.” The question
about evil must receive adequate discussion; what was said of it has not, it is true, a very
likely appearance, and yet it appears to me that it ought not to be simply overlooked. The
question is whether evil, also, was made through the Logos, taking the Logos, now be it well
noted, in the sense of that reason which is in every one, as thus brought into being by the
reason which was from the beginning. The Apostle says:4698 “Without the law sin was
dead,” and adds, “But when the commandment came sin revived,” and so teaches generally
about sin that it has no power before the law and the commandment (but the Logos is, in
a sense, law and commandment), and there would be no sin were there no law, for,4699 “sin
is not imputed where there is no law.” And, again, there would be no sin but for the Logos,
for “if I had not come and spoken unto them,” Christ says,4700 “they had not had sin.” For
every excuse is taken away from one who wants to make excuse for his sin, if, though the
Word is in him and shows him what he ought to do, he does not obey it. It seems, then,
that all things, the worse things not excepted, were made by the Logos, and without Him,
taking the nothing here in its simpler sense, was nothing made. Nor must we blame the
Logos if all things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made, any more than
we blame the master who has showed the pupil his duty, when the instruction has been such
as to leave the pupil, should he sin, no excuse or room to say that he erred through ignorance.
This appears the more plainly when we consider that master and pupil are inseparable. For
as master and pupil are correlatives, and belong together, so the Logos is present in the
nature of reasonable beings as such, always suggesting what they ought to do, even should
we pay no heed to his commands, but devote ourselves to pleasure and allow his best
counsels to pass by us unregarded. As the eye is a servant given us for the best purposes,
and yet we use it to see things on which it is wrong for us to look, and as we make a wrong
use of our hearing when we spend our time in listening to singing competitions and to
other forbidden sounds, so we outrage the Logos who is in us, and use Him otherwise than
as we ought, when we make Him assist in our transgressions. For He is present with those
who sin, for their condemnation, and He condemns the man who does not prefer Him to
everything else. Hence we find it written:4701 “The word which I have spoken unto you,
the same shall judge you.” That is as if He should say: “I, the Word, who am always lifting
up my voice in you, I, myself, will judge you, and no refuge or excuse will then be left you.”
This interpretation, however, may appear somewhat strained, as we have taken the Word

in one sense to be the Word in the beginning, who was with God, God the Word, and have
now taken it in another sense, speaking of it, not only in reference to the principal works
of creation, as in the words, “All things were made through Him,” but as related to all the
acts of reasonable beings, this last being the Logos (reason), without whose presence none
of our sins are committed. The question arises whether the Logos in us is to be pronounced
the same being as that which was in the beginning and was with God, God the Word. The
Apostle, certainly, does not appear to make the Logos in us a different being from the Logos
who was in the beginning with God. “Say not in thine heart,” he says,4702 “who shall go up
into heaven; that is to bring Christ down, or who shall go down into the abyss; that is to
bring Christ up from the dead. But what saith the Scripture? The Logos is very nigh thee,
in thy mouth and in thy heart.”</p>

<head>10. “That Which Was Made Was Life in Him, and the Life Was the Light of Men.”
This Involves the Paradox that What Does Not Derive Life from the Logos Does
Not Live at All.</head>
<p>The Greeks have certain apothegms, called paradoxes, in which the wisdom of their
sages is presented at its highest, and some proof, or what appears to be proof, is given. Thus
it is said that the wise man alone, and that every wise man, is a priest, because the wise man
alone and every wise man possesses knowledge as to the service of God. Again, that the
wise man alone and that every wise man is free and has received from the divine law authority
to do what he himself is minded to do, and this authority they call lawful power of decision.
Why should we say more about these so-called paradoxes? Much discussion is devoted to
them, and they call for a comparison of the sense of Scripture with the doctrine thus conveyed.
so that we may be in a position to determine where religious doctrine agrees with
them and where it differs from them. This has been suggested to us by our study of the
words, “That which was made was life in Him;” for it appears possible to follow the words
of Scripture here and to make out a number of things which partake of the character of the
paradoxes and are even more paradoxical than these sentences of the Greeks. If we consider
the Logos in the beginning, who was with God, God the Word, we shall perhaps be able to
declare that only he who partakes of this being, considered in this character, is to be pronounced
reasonable (“logical”), and thus we should demonstrate that the saint alone is
reasonable. Again, if we apprehend that life has come in the Logos, he, namely, who said,
“I am the life,” then we shall say that no one is alive who is outside the faith of Christ, that
all are dead who are not living to God, that their life is life to sin, and therefore, if I may so
express myself, a life of death. Consider however, whether the divine Scriptures do not in
many places teach this; as where the Saviour says,4703 “Or have ye not read that which was
spoken at the bush, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
He is not God of the dead but of the living.” And4704 “Before Thee shall no living being be
justified.” But why need we speak about God Himself or the Saviour? For it is disputed to
which of them the voice belongs which says in the prophets,4705 “As I live, saith the Lord.”</p>

<head>11. How No One is Righteous or Can Truly Be Said to Live in Comparison with
God.</head>
<p>First let us look at the words, “He is not the God of the dead but of the living.” That is
equivalent to saying that He is not the God of sinners but of saints. For it was a great gift
to the Patriarchs that God in place of His own name should add their name to His own
designation as God, as Paul says,4706 “Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God.”
He is the God, therefore, of the fathers and of all the saints; it might be hard to find a passage
to the effect that God is the God of any of the wicked. If, then, He is the God of the saints,
and is said to be the God of the living, then the saints are the living and the living are saints;
neither is there any saint outside the living, nor when any one is called living is the further
implication absent that in addition to his having life he is a holy one. Near akin to this is
the lesson to be drawn from the saying,4707 “I shall be well pleasing to the Lord in the land
of the living.” The good pleasure of the Lord, he appears to say, is in the ranks of the saints,
or in the place of the saints, and it is there that he hopes to be. No one pleases God well
who has not entered the rank of the saints, or the place of the saints; and to that place every
one must come who has assumed beforehand, as it were in this life, the shadow and image
of true God-pleasing. The passage which declares that before God no living being shall be
justified shows that in comparison with God and the righteousness that is in Him none,
even of the most finished saints, will be justified. We might take a parable from another
quarter and say that no candle can give light before the sun, not that the candle will not give
light, only it will not when the sun outshines it. In the same way every “living” will be justified,
only not before God, when it is compared with those who are below and who are in
the power of darkness. To them the light of the saints will shine. Here, perhaps, we have
the key to the meaning of that verse:4708 “Let your light shine before men.” He does not
say, Let your light shine before God; had he said so he would have given a commandment
impossible of fulfilment, as if he had bidden those lights which have souls to let their light
shine before the sun. It is not only, therefore, the ordinary mass of the living who will not
be justified before God, but even those among the living who are distinguished above the
rest, or, to put it more truly, the whole righteousness of the living will not be justified before
God, as compared with the righteousness of God, as if I were to call together all the lights
which shine on the earth by night, and to say that they could not give light in comparison
with the rays of the sun. We rise from these considerations to a higher level when we take
the words before our minds, “I live, saith the Lord.” Life, in the full sense of the word, especially
after what we have been saying on the subject, belongs perhaps to God and none but
<note type="footnote">4706 Heb. xi. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">4707 Ps. cxvi. 9.</note>

Him. Is this the reason why the Apostle, after speaking of the supreme excellency of the life
of God and being led to the highest expression about it, says about God (showing in this a
true understanding of that saying, “I live, saith the Lord”); “who only hath immortality.”4709
No living being besides God has life free from change and variation. Why should we be in
further doubt? Even Christ did not share the Father’s immortality; for He “tasted death for
every man.”</p>

<head>12. Is the Saviour All that He Is, to All?</head>
<p>We have thus enquired as to the life of God, and the life which is Christ, and the living
who are in a place by themselves, and have seen how the living are not justified before God,
and we have noticed the cognate statement, “Who alone hath immortality.” We may now
take up the assumption which may appear to be involved in this, namely, that whatever being
is gifted with reason does not possess blessedness as a part of its essence, or as an inseparable
part of its nature. For if blessedness and the highest life were an inseparable characteristic
of reasonable being, how could it be truly said of God that He only has immortality? We
should therefore remark, that the Saviour is some things, not to Himself but to others, and
some things both to Himself and others, and we must enquire if there are some things which
He is to Himself and to no other. Clearly it is to others that He is a Shepherd, not a shepherd
like those among men who make gain out of their occupation; unless the benefit conferred
on the sheep might be regarded, on account of His love to men, as a benefit to Himself also.
Similarly it is to others that He is the Way and the Door, and, as all will admit, the Rod. To
Himself and to others He is Wisdom and perhaps also Reason (Logos). It may be asked
whether, as He has in Himself a system of speculations, inasmuch as He is wisdom, there
are some of those speculations which cannot be received by any nature that is begotten, but
His own, and which He knows for Himself only. Nor should the reverence we owe to the
Holy Spirit keep us from seeking to answer this question. For the Holy Spirit Himself receives
instruction, as is clear from what is said about the Paraclete and the Holy Spirit,4710 “He
shall take of mine and shall declare it to you.” Does He, then, from these instructions, take
in everything that the Son, gazing at the Father from the first, Himself knows? That would
require further consideration. And if the Saviour is some things to others, and some things
it may be to Himself, and to no other, or to one only, or to few, then we ask, in so far as He
is the life which came in the Logos, whether he is life to Himself and to others, or to others,
and if to others, to what others. And are life and the light of men the same thing, for the
text says, “That which was made was life in Him and the life was the light of men.” But the
light of men is the light only of some, not of all, rational creatures; the word “men” which
is added shows this. But He is the light of men, and so He is the life of those whose light he
is also. And inasmuch as He is life He may be called the Saviour, not for Himself but to be
life to others, whose light also He is. And this life comes to the Logos and is inseparable
from Him, once it has come to Him. But the Logos, who cleanses the soul, must have been
in the soul first; it is after Him and the cleansing that proceeds from Him, when all that is
dead or weak in her has been taken away, that pure life comes to every one who has made
himself a fit dwelling for the Logos, considered as God.</p>

<head>13. How the Life in the Logos Comes After the Beginning.</head>
<p>Here, we must carefully observe, we have two things which are one, and we have to
define the difference between them. First, what is before us in The Word in the beginning,
then what is implied in The Life in the Word. The Word was not made in the beginning;
there was no time when the beginning was devoid of the Word, and hence it is said, “In the
beginning was the Word.” Of life, on the other hand, we read, not that it was as the Word,
but that it was made; if at least it be the case that the life is the light of men. For when man
was not yet, there was no light of men; for the light of men is conceived only in relation to
men. And let no one annoy us with the objection that we have put this under the category
of time, though it be the order of the things themselves, that make them first and second
and so on, and even though there should have been no time when the things placed by the
Logos third and fourth were not in existence. As, then, all things were made by Him, not
all things were by Him, and as without Him was nothing made, not, without Him nothing
was, so what was made in Him, not what was in Him, was life. And, again, not what was
made in the beginning was the Word, but what was in the beginning was the Word. Some
of the copies, it is true, have a reading which is not devoid of probability, “What was made
is life in Him.” But if life is the same thing as the light of men, then no one who is in darkness
is living, and none of the living is in darkness; but every one who is alive is also in light, and
every one who is in light is living, so that not he only who is living, but every one who is
living, is a son of light; and he who is a son of light is he whose work shines before men.</p>

<head>14. How the Natures of Men are Not So Fixed from the First, But that They May
Pass from Darkness to Light.</head>
<p>We have been discussing certain things which are opposite, and what has been said of
them may serve to suggest what has been omitted. We are speaking of life and the light of
men, and the opposite to life is death; the opposite to the light of men, the darkness of men.
It is therefore plain that he who is in the darkness of men is in death, and that he who works
the works of death is nowhere but in darkness. But he who is mindful of God, if we consider
what it is to be mindful of Him, is not in death, according to the saying,4711 “In death there
is no one who remembers Thee.” Are the darkness of men, and death, such as they are by
nature? On this point we have another passage,4712 “We were once darkness, but now light
in the Lord,” even if we be now in the fullest sense saints and spiritual persons. Thus he
who was once darkness has become, like Paul, capable of being light in the Lord. Some
consider that some natures are spiritual from the first, such as those of Paul and the holy
Apostles; but I scarcely see how to reconcile with such a view, what the above text tells us,
that the spiritual person was once darkness and afterwards became light. For if the spiritual
was once darkness what can the earthy have been? But if it is true that darkness became
light, as in the text, how is it unreasonable to suppose that all darkness is capable of becoming
light? Had not Paul said, “We were once in darkness, but now are we light in the Lord,”
and thus implied of those whom they consider to be naturally lost, that they were darkness,
or are darkness still, the hypothesis about the different natures might have been admissible.
But Paul distinctly says that he had once been darkness but was now light in the Lord, which
implies the possibility that darkness should turn into light. But he who perceives the possibility
of a change on each side for the better or for the worse, will not find it hard to gain
an insight into every darkness of men, or into that death which consists in the darkness of
men.</p>

<head>15. Heracleon’s View that the Lord Brought Life Only to the Spiritual. Refutation
of This.</head>
<p>Heracleon adopts a somewhat violent course when he arrives at this passage, “What
was made in Him was life.” Instead of the “In Him” of the text he understands “to those
men who are spiritual,” as if he considered the Logos and the spiritual to be identical, though
this he does not plainly say; and then he proceeds to give, as it were, an account of the origin
of the matter and says, “He (the Logos) provided them with their first form at their birth,
carrying further and making manifest what had been sown by another,4713 into form and
into illumination and into an outline of its own.” He did not observe how Paul speaks of
the spiritual,4714 and how he refrains from saying that they are men. “A natural man receiveth
not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; but the spiritual
judgeth all things.” We maintain that it was not without a meaning that he did not add the
word men to the word spiritual. Spiritual is something better than man, for man receives
his form either in soul, or in body, or in both together, not in what is more divine than these,
namely, in spirit; and it is after he has come to have a prevailing share of this that he is called
“spiritual.” Moreover, in bringing forward such a hypothesis as this, he furnishes not even
the pretence of a proof, and shows himself unable to reach even a moderate degree of
plausibility for his argument on the subject. So much, then, for him.</p>

<head>16. The Life May Be the Light of Others Besides.</head>
<p>Let us suggest another question, namely, whether the life was the light of men only, and
not of every being as well that is in blessedness. For if the life were the same thing as the
light of men, and if the light of Christ were for men alone, then the life also would be only
for men. But such a view is both foolish and impious, since the other Scriptures testify
against this interpretation and declare that, when we are somewhat more advanced, we shall
be equal to the angels.4715 The question is to be solved on the principle that when a predicate
is applied to certain persons, it is not to be at once taken to apply to them alone. Thus, when
the light of men is spoken of, it is not the light of men only; had that been the meaning, a
word would have been added to express it; the life, it would have read, was the light of men
only. For it is possible for the light of men to be the light of others besides men, just as it is
possible that certain animals and certain plants may form the food of men, and that the
same animals and plants should be the food of other creatures too. That is an example from
common life; it is fitting that another analogy should be adduced from the inspired books.
Now the question here before us, is why the light of men should not be the light of other
creatures also, and we have seen that to speak of the light of men by no means excludes the
possibility that the light may be that of other beings besides man, whether inferior to him
or like him. Now a name is given to God; He is said to be the God of Abraham and of Isaac
and of Jacob. He, then, who infers from the saying, “The life was the light of men,” that the
light is for no other than for men, ought also to conclude that the God of Abraham and the
God of Isaac and the God of Jacob is the God of no one else but these three patriarchs. But
He is also the God of Elijah,4716 and, as Judith says,4717 of her father Simeon, and the God
of the Hebrews. By analogy of reasoning, then, if nothing prevents Him from being the
God of others, nothing prevents the light of men from being the light of others besides men.</p>

<head>17. The Higher Powers are Men; And Christ is Their Light Also.</head>
<p>Another, again, appeals to the text, “Let us make man according to our image and likeness,
4718” and maintains that whatever is made according to God’s image and likeness is
man. To support this, numberless instances are adduced to show that in Scripture “man”
and “angel” are used indifferently, and that the same subject is entitled both angel and man.
This is true of the three who were entertained by Abraham, and of the two who came to
Sodom; in the whole course of Scripture, persons are styled sometimes men, sometimes
angels. Those who hold this view will say that since persons are styled angels who are
manifestly men, as when Zechariah says,4719 “The messenger of the Lord, I am with you,
saith the Lord Almighty,” and as it is written of John the Baptist,4720 “Behold I send My
messenger before thy face,” the angels (messengers) of God are so called on account of their
office, and are not here called men on account of their nature. It confirms this view that
the names applied to the higher powers are not those of species of living beings, but those
of the orders, assigned by God to this and to that reasonable being. “Throne” is not a species
of living being, nor “dominion,” nor “principality,” nor “power”; these are names of the
businesses to which those clothed with the names have been appointed; the subjects themselves
are nothing but men, but the subject has come to be a throne, or a dominion, or a
principality, or a power. In Joshua, the son of Nun, we read4721 that in Jericho there appeared
to Joshua a man who said, “I am captain of the Lord’s host, now am I come.” The outcome
of this is that the light of men must be held to be the same as the light of every being endowed
with reason; for every reasonable being is man, since it is according to the image and likeness
of God. It is spoken of in three different ways, “the light of men,” and simply “the light,”
and “the true light.” It is the light of men either, as we showed before, because there is
nothing to prevent us from regarding it as the light of other beings besides men, or because
all beings endowed with reason are called men because they are made in the image of God.</p>

<head>18. How God Also is Light, But in a Different Way; And How Life Came Before
Light.</head>
<p>The Saviour is here called simply light. But in the Catholic Epistle of this same John4722
we read that God is light. This, it has been maintained, furnishes a proof that the Son is not
in substance different from the Father. Another student, however, looking into the matter
more closely and with a sounder judgment, will say that the light which shines in darkness
and is not overtaken by it, is not the same as the light in which there is no darkness at all.
The light which shines in darkness comes upon this darkness, as it were, and is pursued by
it, and, in spite of attempts made upon it, is not overtaken. But the light in which there is
no darkness at all neither shines on darkness, nor is at first pursued by it, so as to prove
victor and to have it recorded that it was not overtaken by its pursuer. The third designation
was “the true light.” But in proportion as God, since He is the Father of truth, is more and
greater than truth, and since He is the Father of wisdom is greater and more excellent than
wisdom, in the same proportion He is more than the true light. We may learn, perhaps, in
a more suggestive manner, how the Father and the Son are two lights, from David, who says
in the thirty-fifth Psalm,4723 “In Thy light we shall see light.” This same light of men which
shines in darkness, the true light, is called, further on in the Gospel, the light of the world;
Jesus says,4724 “I am the light of the world.” Nor must we omit to notice that whereas the
passage might very well have run, “That which was made was in Him the light of men, and
the light of men was life,” he chose the opposite order. He puts life before the light of men,
even if life and the light of men are the same thing; in thinking of those who have part in
life, though that life is also the light of men, we are to come first to the fact that they are
living the divine life spoken of before; then we come to their enlightenment. For life must
come first if the living person is to be enlightened; it would not be a good arrangement to
speak of the illumination of one not yet conceived as living, and to make life come after the
illumination. For though “life” and “the light” of men are the same thing, the notions are
taken separately. This light of men is also called, by Isaiah, “the light of the Gentiles,” where
he says,4725 “Behold I have set Thee for a covenant of the generation, for a light of the
Gentiles;” and David, placing his confidence in this light, says in the twenty-sixth Psalm,4726
“The Lord is my illumination and my Saviour; whom shall I fear?”</p>

<head>19. The Life Here Spoken of is the Higher Life, that of Reason.</head>
<p>As for those who make up a mythology about the æons and arrange them in syzygies
(yokes or pairs), and who consider the Logos and Life to have been emitted by Intellect and
Truth, it may not be beside the point to state the following difficulties. How can life, in their
system, the yokefellow of the Word, derive his origin from his yokefellow? For “what was
made in Him,” he says, evidently referring to the Word, mentioned immediately before,
“was life.” Will they tell us how life, the yokefellow, as they say, of the Word, came into
being in the Word, and how life rather than the Word is the light of men. It would be quite
natural if men of reasonable minds, who are perplexed with such questions and find the
point we have raised hard to dispose of, should turn round upon us and invite us to discuss
the reason why it is not the Word that is said to be the light of men, but life which originated
in the Word. To such an enquiry we shall reply that the life here spoken of is not that which
is common to rational beings and to beings without reason, but that life which is added to
us upon the completion of reason in us, our share in that life, being derived from the first
reason (Logos). It is when we turn away from the life which is life in appearance only, not
in truth, and when we yearn to be filled with the true life, that we are made partakers of it,
and when it has arisen in us it becomes the foundation of the light of the higher knowledge
(gnosis). With some it may be that this life is only potentially and not actually light, with
those who do not strive to search out the things of the higher knowledge, while with others
it is actually light. With these it clearly is so who act on Paul’s injunction, “Seek earnestly
the best gifts;” and among the greatest gifts is that which all are enjoined to seek, namely,
the word of wisdom, and it is followed by the word of knowledge. This wisdom and this
knowledge lie side by side; into the difference between them this is not a fitting occasion to
enquire.</p>

<head>20. Different Kinds of Light; And of Darkness.</head>
<p>“And4727 the light shineth in darkness and the darkness hath not overtaken it.” We are
still enquiring about the light of men, since it is what was spoken of in the preceding verse,
and also, I consider, about darkness, which is named as its adversary, the darkness also being,
if the definition of it is correct, that of men. The light of men is a generic notion covering
two special things; and with the darkness of men it is the same. He who has gained the light
of men and shares its beams will do the work of light and know in the higher sense, being
illuminated by the light of the higher knowledge. And we must recognize the analogous
case of those on the other side, and of their evil actions, and of that which is thought to be
but is not really knowledge, since those who exercise it have the reason (Logos) not of light
but of darkness. And because the sacred word knows the things which produce light, Isaiah
says:4728 “Because Thy commandments are a light upon the earth,” and David says in the
Psalm,4729 “The precept of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes.” But since in addition
to the commandments and the precepts there is a light of higher knowledge, we read in one
of the twelve (prophets),4730 “Sow to yourselves for righteousness, reap to yourselves for
the fruit of life, make light for yourselves the light of knowledge.” There is a further light
of knowledge in addition to the commandments, and so we read, “Make light for yourselves,”
not simply light, but what light?—the light of knowledge. For if any light that a man kindles
for himself were a light of knowledge, then the added words, “Make light for yourselves, the
light of knowledge,” would have no meaning. And again that darkness is brought upon
men by their evil deeds, we learn from John himself, when he says in his epistle,4731 “If we
say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth,”
and again, “He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until
now,” and again, “He that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and
knoweth not whither he goeth, because darkness hath blinded his eyes.” Walking in darkness
signifies evil conduct, and to hate one’s brother, is not that to fall away from that which is
properly called knowledge? But he also who is ignorant of divine things walks in darkness,
just because of that ignorance; as David says,4732 “They knew not, they understood not,
they walk in darkness.” Consider, however, this passage,4733 “God is light and in Him is

no4734 darkness,” and see if the reason for this saying is not that darkness is not one, being
either two, because there are two kinds of it, or many, because it is taken distributively, individually
with reference to the many evil actions and the many false doctrines; so that there
are many darknesses, not one of which is in God. The saying of the Saviour could not be
spoken of the Holy One, “Ye are the light of the world;” for the Holy One is light of the
world (absolute, not particular), and there is not in Him any darkness.</p>

<head>21. Christ is Not, Like God, Quite Free from Darkness: Since He Bore Our Sins.</head>
<p>Now some one will ask how this statement that there is no darkness in Him can be regarded
as a thing peculiar to Him, when we consider that the Saviour also was quite without
sin. Could it not be said of Him also that “He is light, and that there is no darkness in Him”?
The difference between the two cases has been partly set forth above. We will now, however,
go a step further than we did before, and add, that if God made Christ who knew no sin to
be sin for us,4735 then it could not be said of Him that there was no darkness in Him. For
if Jesus was in the likeness4736 of the flesh of sin and for sin, and condemned sin by taking
upon Him the likeness of the flesh of sin, then it cannot be said of Him, absolutely and directly,
that there was no darkness in Him. We may add that “He4737 took our infirmities
and bare our sicknesses,” both infirmities of the soul and sicknesses of the hidden man of
our heart. On account of these infirmities and sicknesses which He bore away from us, He
declares His soul to be sorrowful and sore troubled,4738 and He is said in Zechariah to have
put on filthy garments,4739 which, when He was about to take them off, are said to be sins.
“Behold, it is said, I have taken away thy sins.” Because He had taken on Himself the sins
of the people of those who believed in Him, he uses many such expressions as these: “Far
from my salvation are the words of my transgressions,”4740 and “Thou knowest my foolishness,
and my sins were not hid from Thee.”4741 And let no one suppose that we say this
from any lack of piety towards the Christ of God; for as the Father alone has immortality
and our Lord took upon Himself, for His love to men, the death He died for us, so to the
Father alone the words apply, “In Him is no darkness,” since Christ took upon Himself, for
His goodwill towards men, our darknesses. This He did, that by His power He might destroy
our death and remove the darkness which is in our soul, so that the saying in Isaiah might
be fulfilled,4742 “The people that sat in darkness saw a great light.” This light, which came
into being in the Logos, and is also life, shines in the darkness of our souls, and it has come
where the rulers of this darkness carry on their struggle with the race of men and strive to
subdue to darkness those who do not stand firm with all their power; that they might be
enlightened the light has come so far, and that they might be called sons of light. And
shining in darkness this light is pursued by the darkness, but not overtaken.</p>

<head>22. How the Darkness Failed to Overtake the Light.</head>
<p>Should any one consider that we are adding something that is not written, namely, the
pursuit of the light by the darkness, let him reflect that unless the darkness had pursued the
light the words, “The darkness did not overtake it,” would have no meaning. John writes
for those who have wit to see what is omitted and to supply it as the context requires, and
so he wrote, “The darkness did not overtake it.” If it did not overtake it, it must first have
pursued it, and that the darkness did pursue the light is clear from what the Saviour suffered,
and those also who received His teachings, His own children, when darkness was doing
what it could against the sons of light and was minded to drive light away from men. But
since, if God be for us,4743 no one, however that way minded, can be against us, the more
they humbled themselves the more they grew, and they prevailed exceedingly. In two ways
the darkness did not overtake the light. Either it was left far behind and was itself so slow,
while the light was in its course so sharp and swift, that it was not even able to keep following
it, or if the light sought to lay a snare for the darkness, and waited for it in pursuance of the
plan it had formed, then darkness, coming near the light, was brought to an end. In either
case the darkness did not overtake the light.</p>

<head>23. There is a Divine Darkness Which is Not Evil, and Which Ultimately Becomes
Light.</head>
<p>In connection with this subject it is necessary for us to point out that darkness is not to
be understood, every time it is mentioned, in a bad sense; Scripture speaks of it sometimes
in a good sense. The heterodox have failed to observe this distinction, and have accordingly
adopted most shameful doctrines about the Maker of the world, and have indeed revolted
from Him, and addicted themselves to fictions and myths. We must, therefore, show how
and when the name of darkness is taken in a good sense. Darkness and clouds and tempest
are said in Exodus4744 to be round about God, and in the seventeenth Psalm,4745 “He made
darkness His secret place, His tent round about Him, dark water in clouds of the air.” Indeed,
if one considers the multitude of speculation and knowledge about God, beyond the power
of human nature to take in, beyond the power, perhaps, of all originated beings except Christ
and the Holy Spirit, then one may know how God is surrounded with darkness, because the
discourse is hid in ignorance which would be required to tell in what darkness He has made
His hiding-place when He arranged that the things concerning Him should be unknown
and beyond the grasp of knowledge. Should any one be staggered by these expositions, he
may be reconciled to them both by the “dark sayings” and by the “treasures of darkness,”
hidden, invisible, which are given to Christ by God. In nowise different, I consider, are the
treasures of darkness which are hid in Christ, from what is spoken of in the text, “God made
darkness His secret place,” and (the saint) “shall understand parable and dark saying.”4746
And consider if we have here the reason of the Saviour’s saying to His disciples, “What ye
have heard in darkness, speak ye in the light.” The mysteries committed to them in secret
and where few could hear, hard to be known and obscure, He bids them, when enlightened
and therefore said to be in the light, to make known to every one who is made light. I might
add a still stranger feature of this darkness which is praised, namely, that it hastens to the
light and overtakes it, and so at last, after having been unknown as darkness, undergoes for
him who does not see its power such a change that he comes to know it and to declare that
what was formerly known to him as darkness has now become light.</p>

<head>24. John the Baptist Was Sent. From Where? His Soul Was Sent from a Higher
Region.</head>
<p>“There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.”4747 He who is sent is sent
from somewhere to somewhere; and the careful student will, therefore, enquire from what
quarter John was sent, and whither. The “whither” is quite plain on the face of the story;
he was sent to Israel, and to those who were willing to hear him when he was staying in the
wilderness of Judæa and baptizing by the banks of the Jordan. According to the deeper
sense, however, he was sent into the world, the world being understood as this earthly place
where men are; and the careful student will have this in view in enquiring from where John
was sent. Examining the words more closely, he will perhaps declare that as it is written of
Adam,4748 “And the Lord sent him forth out of the Paradise of pleasure to till the earth, out
of which he was taken,” so also John was sent, either from heaven or from Paradise, or from
some other quarter to this place on the earth. He was sent that he might bear witness of the
light. There is, however, an objection to this interpretation, which is not to be lightly dismissed.
It is written in Isaiah:4749 “Whom shall I send, and who will go to the people?”
The prophet answers: “Here am I,—send me.” He, then, who objects to that rendering of
our passage which appears to be the deeper may say that Isaiah was sent not to this world
from another place, but after having seen “the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up,”
was sent to the people, to say, “Hearing, ye shall hear and shall not understand,” and so on;
and that in the same manner John, the beginning of his mission not being narrated, is sent
after the analogy of the mission of Isaiah, to baptize,4750 and to make ready for the Lord a
people prepared for Him, and to bear witness of the light. So much we have said of the first
sense; and now we adduce certain solutions which help to confirm the deeper meaning
about John. In the same passage it is added, “He came for witness, to bear witness of the
light.” Now, if he came, where did he come from? To those who find it difficult to follow
us, we point to what John says afterwards of having seen the Holy Spirit as a dove descending
on the Saviour. “He that sent me,” he says,4751 “to baptize with water, He said unto me,
Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Holy Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the
same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.” When did He send him and
give him this injunction? The answer to this question will probably be that when He sent
him to begin to baptize, then He who was dealing with him uttered this word. But a more

into the body, the one object of his entry into this life being that he should bear witness of
the truth, may be drawn from the narrative of his birth. Gabriel, when announcing to
Zacharias the birth of John, and to Mary the advent of our Saviour among men, says:4752
That John is to be “filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.” And we have
also the saying, “For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe
leaped in my womb for joy.” He who sedulously guards himself in his dealings with Scripture
against forced, or casual, or capricious procedure, must necessarily assume that John’s soul
was older than his body, and subsisted by itself before it was sent on the ministry of the
witness of the light. Nor must we overlook the text, “This is Elijah which is to come.”4753
For if that general doctrine of the soul is to be received, namely, that it is not sown at the
same time with the body, but is before it, and is then, for various causes, clothed with flesh
and blood; then the words “sent from God” will not appear to be applicable to John alone.
The most evil of all, the man of sin, the son of perdition, is said by Paul to be sent by God:4754
“God sendeth them a working of error that they should believe a lie; that they all might be
judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” But our present
question may, perhaps, be solved in this way, that as every man is a man of God, simply
because God created him, but not every man is called a man of God, but only he who has
devoted himself to God, such as Elijah and those who are called men of God in the Scriptures,
thus every man might be said in ordinary language to be sent from God, but in the absolute
sense no one is to be spoken of in this way who has not entered this life for a divine ministry
and in the service of the salvation of mankind. We do not find it said of any one but the
saints that he is sent by God. It is said of Isaiah as we showed before; it is also said of
Jeremiah, “To whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go”;4755 and it is said of Ezekiel,4756
“I send thee to nations that are rebellious and have not believed in Me.” The examples,
however, do not expressly speak of a mission from the region outside life into life, and as it
is a mission into life that we are enquiring about, they may seem to have little bearing on
our subject. But there is nothing absurd in our transferring the argument derived from
them to our question. They tell us that it is only the saints, and we were speaking of them,
whom God is said to send, and in this sense they may be applied to the case of those who
are sent into this life.</p>

<head>25. Argument from the Prayer of Joseph, to Show that the Baptist May Have Been
an Angel Who Became a Man.</head>
<p>As we are now engaged with what is said of John, and are asking about his mission, I
may take the opportunity to state the view which I entertain about him. We have read this
prophecy about him, “Behold, I send My messenger (angel) before Thy face, who shall prepare
Thy way before Thee;” and at this we ask if it can be one of the holy angels who is sent down
on this ministry as forerunner of our Saviour. No wonder if, when the first-born of all cre-
ation was assuming a human body, some of them should have been filled with love to man
and become admirers and followers of Christ, and thought it good to minister to his kindness
towards man by having a body like that of men. And who would not be moved at the thought
of his leaping for joy when yet in the belly, surpassing as he did the common nature of man?
Should the piece entitled “The prayer of Joseph,” one of the apocryphal works current among
the Hebrews, be thought worthy of credence, this dogma will be found in it clearly expressed.
Those at the beginning, it is represented, having some marked distinction beyond men, and
being much greater than other souls, because they were angels, they have come down to
human nature. Thus Jacob says: “I, Jacob, who speak to you, and Israel, I am an angel of
God, a ruling spirit, and Abraham and Isaac were created before every work of God; and I
am Jacob, called Jacob by men, but my name is Israel, called Israel by God, a man seeing
God, because I am the first-born of every creature which God caused to live.” And he adds:
“When I was coming from Mesopotamia of Syria, Uriel, the angel of God, came forth, and
said, I have come down to the earth and made my dwelling among men, and I am called
Jacob by name. He was wroth with me and fought with me and wrestled against me, saying
that his name and the name of Him who is before every angel should be before my name.
And I told him his name and how great he was among the sons of God; Art not thou Uriel
my eighth, and I am Israel and archangel of the power of the Lord and a chief captain among
the sons of God? Am not I Israel, the first minister in the sight of God, and I invoked my
God by the inextinguishable name?” It is likely that this was really said by Jacob, and was
therefore written down, and that there is also a deeper meaning in what we are told, “He
supplanted his brother in the womb.” Consider whether the celebrated question about
Jacob and Esau has a solution. We read,4757 “The children being not yet born, neither
having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might
stand, not of works but of him that calleth, it was said, “The elder shall serve the younger.”
Even as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” What shall we say, then? Is there
unrighteousness with God? God forbid.” If, then, when they were not yet born, and had
not done anything either good or evil, in order that God’s purpose according to election
might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth, if at such a period this was said, how if
<note type="footnote">4757 Rom. ix. 11–14.</note>

<pb n="642"/>
we do not go back to the works done before this life, can it be said that there is no unrighteousness
with God when the elder serves the younger and is hated (by God) before he has
done anything worthy of slavery or of hatred? We have made something of a digression in
introducing this story about Jacob and appealing to a writing which we cannot well treat
with contempt; but it certainly adds weight to our argument about John, to the effect that
as Isaiah’s voice declares4758 he is an angel who assumed a body for the sake of bearing
witness to the light. So much about John considered as a man.</p>

<head>26. John is Voice, Jesus is Speech. Relation of These Two to Each Other.</head>
<p>Now we know voice and speech to be different things. The voice can be produced
without any meaning and with no speech in it, and similarly speech can be reported to the
mind without voice, as when we make mental excursions, within ourselves. And thus the
Saviour is, in one view of Him, speech, and John differs from Him; for as the Saviour is
speech, John is voice. John himself invites me to take this view of him, for to those who
asked who he was, he answered, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the
way of the Lord! make His paths straight!” This explains, perhaps, how it was that
Zacharias lost his voice at the birth of the voice which points out the Word of God, and only
recovered it when the voice, forerunner of the Word, was born. A voice must be perceived
with the ears if the mind is afterwards to receive the speech which the voice indicates. Hence,
John is, in point of his birth, a little older than Christ, for our voice comes to us before our
speech. But John also points to Christ; for speech is brought forward by the voice. And
Christ is baptized by John, though John declares himself to have need to be baptized by
Christ; for with men speech is purified by voice, though the natural way is that speech should
purify the voice which indicates it. In a word, when John points out Christ, it is man
pointing out God, the Saviour incorporeal, the voice pointing out the Word.</p>

<head>27. Significance of the Names of John and of His Parents.</head>
<p>The force that is in names may be applied in many matters, and it may be worth our
while to ask at this point what is the significance of the names John and Zacharias. The relatives
wish, as the giving of a name is a thing not to be lightly disposed of, to call the child
Zacharias, and are surprised that Elisabeth should want him to be called John. Zacharias
then writes, “His name is John,” and is at once freed from his troublesome silence. On examining
the names, then, we find “Joannes” to be “Joa” without the “nes.” The New Testament
gives Hebrew names a Greek form and treats them as Greek words; Jacob is changed
into Jacobus, Symeon into Simon, and Joannes is the same as Joa. Zacharias is said to be
memory, and Elisabeth “oath of my God,” or “strength of my God.” John then came into
the world from grace of God (=Joa=Joannes), and his parents were Memory (about God)
and the Oath of our God, about the fathers. Thus was he born to make ready for the Lord
a people fit for Him, at the end of the Covenant now grown old, which is the end of the
Sabbatic period. Hence it is not possible that the rest after the Sabbath should have come
into existence from the seventh of our God; on the contrary, it is our Saviour who, after the
pattern of His own rest, caused us to be made in the likeness of His death, and hence also
of His resurrection.4759</p>
<note type="footnote">4759 Origen appears to be pointing to the fact that the Christian rest which is connected in its origin with
the resurrection of Christ is not held as the Jewish Sabbath rest on the seventh but on the first day of the week.
John marking the end of the old period is the son of Elisabeth the oath, or seventh, of God, and is thus connected
with the seventh day; but not so Jesus.</note>

<head>28. The Prophets Bore Witness to Christ and Foretold Many Things Concerning
Him.</head>
<p>“He came for a witness that He might bear witness of the light, that all through Him
might believe.”4760 Some of the dissenters from the Church’s doctrine, men who profess
to believe in Christ, have desired another being, as indeed their system requires, besides the
Creator, and hence cannot allow His coming to the world to have been foretold by the
prophets.4761 They therefore endeavour to get rid of the testimonies of the prophets about
Christ, and say that the Son of God has no need of witnesses, but that He brings with Him
His own evidence, partly in the sound words full of power which He proclaimed and partly
in the wonderful works He did, which were sufficient at once to convince any one whatever.
Then they say: If Moses is believed on account of his word and his works, and has no need
of any witnesses to announce him beforehand, and if the prophets were received, every one
of them, by these people, as messengers from God, how should not one who is much greater
than Moses and the prophets accomplish His mission and benefit the human race, without
prophets to bear witness about Him? They regard it as superfluous that He should have
been foretold by the prophets, since the prophets were concerned, as these opponents would
say, that those who believed in Christ should not receive Him as a new God, and therefore
did what they could to bring them to that same God whom Moses and the prophets taught
before Jesus. To this we must say that as there are many causes which may lead men to believe,
since men who are not moved by one argument may be by another, so God is able to
provide for men a number of occasions, any of which may cause their minds to open to the
truth that God, who is over all, has taken on Himself human nature. It is manifest to all,
how some are brought by the prophetic writings to the admiration of Christ. They are
astounded at the voices of so many prophets before Him, which establish the place of His
birth, the country of His upbringing, the power of His teaching, His working of wonderful
works, and His human passion brought to a close by His resurrection. We must notice, too,
that Christ’s stupendous acts of power were able to bring to the faith those of Christ’s own
time, but that they lost their demonstrative force with the lapse of years and began to be
regarded as mythical. Greater evidential value than that of the miracles then performed
attaches to the comparison which we now make between these miracles and the prophecy
of them; this makes it impossible for the student to cast any doubt on the former. The
prophetic testimonies do not declare merely the advent of the Messiah; it is by no means
the case that they teach this and nothing else. They teach a great deal of theology. The relation
of the Father to the Son and of the Son to the Father may be learned not less from what
the prophets announce about Christ, than from the Apostles narrating the splendours of
<note type="footnote">4760 John i. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">4761 The Old Testament belongs to the Creator, the Demiurge.</note>

<pb n="646"/>
the Son of God. A parallel case, which we may venture to adduce, is that of the martyrs,
who were honoured by the witness they bore Him, and by no means conferred any favour
on Him by their witnessing for the Son of God. And how is it if, as many of Christ’s true
disciples were honoured by having thus to witness for Him, so the prophets received from
God as their special gift that of understanding about Christ and announcing Him before,
and that they taught not only those living after Christ’s advent how they should regard the
Son of God, but those also who lived in the generations before Him? As he who in these
times does not know the Son has not the Father either,4762 so also we are to understand it
was in these earlier times. Hence “Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ, and he saw it
and was glad.”4763 He, therefore, who declares that they are not to testify about Christ is
seeking to deprive the chorus of the prophets of the greatest gift they have; for what office
of equal importance would be left to prophecy, inspired as it is by the Holy Spirit, if all
connection with the economy of our Lord and Master were taken away from it? For as these
have their faith well ordered who approach the God of the universe through Mediator and
High-Priest and Paraclete, and as his religion is a halting one who does not go in through
the door to the Father, so also in the case of men of old time. Their religion was sanctified
and made acceptable to God by their knowledge and faith and expectation of Christ. For
we have observed that God declares Himself to be a witness and exhorts them all to declare
the same about Christ, and to be imitators of Him, bearing witness of Him to all who require
it. For he says,4764 “Be witnesses for Me, and I am witness, saith the Lord God, and My
servant whom I have chosen.” Now every one who bears witness to the truth, whether he
support it by words or deeds, or in whatever way, may properly be called a witness (martyr);
but it has come to be the custom of the brotherhood, since they are struck with admiration
of those who have contended to the death for truth and valour, to keep the name of martyr
more properly for those who have borne witness to the mystery of godliness by shedding
their blood for it. The Saviour gives the name of martyr to every one who bears witness to
the truth He declares; thus at the Ascension He says to His disciples:4765 “You shall be my
witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judæa and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the
earth.” The leper who was cleansed4766 had still to bring the gift which Moses commanded
for a testimony to those who did not believe in the Christ. In the same way the martyrs bear
witness for a testimony to the unbelieving, and so do all the saints whose deeds shine before

<head>29. The Six Testimonies of the Baptist Enumerated. Jesus’ “Come and See.” Significance
of the Tenth Hour.</head>
<p>Accordingly John came to bear witness of the light, and in his witness-bearing he cried,
saying,4767 “He that cometh after me exists before me; for He was before me; for of His
fulness we have all received and grace for grace, for the law was given by Moses, but grace
and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten
God, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.” This whole speech is from
the mouth of the Baptist bearing witness to the Christ. Some take it otherwise, and consider
that the words from “for of His fulness” to “He hath declared Him” are from the writer,
John the Apostle. The true state of the case is that John’s first testimony begins, as we said
before, “He that cometh after me,” and ends, “He hath declared Him,” and his second
testimony is that spoken to the priests and levites sent from Jerusalem, whom the Jews had
sent. To them he confesses and does not deny the truth, namely, that he is not the Christ,
nor Elijah, nor the prophet, but “the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight
the way of the Lord, as saith Isaiah the prophet.”4768 After this there is another testimony
of the same Baptist to Christ, still teaching His superior nature, which goes forth into the
whole world and enters into reasonable souls. He says,4769 “There standeth One among
you whom you know not, even He that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not
worthy to unloose.” Consider if, since the heart is in the middle of the whole body, and the
ruling principle in the heart, the saying, “There standeth One among you whom you know
not,” can be understood of4770 the reason which is in every man. John’s fourth testimony
of Christ after these points to His human sufferings. He says,4771 “Behold the Lamb of God,
which taketh away the sin of the world. This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man
who exists before me, for He was before me. And I knew Him not, but that He should be
made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.” And the fifth testimony
is recorded in the words,4772 “I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and
it abode upon Him, and I knew Him not, but He that sent me to baptize with water, He said
unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him,
the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and borne witness that
this is the Son of God.” In the sixth place John witnesses of Christ to the two disciples:4773
<note type="footnote">4767 i. 7, 15–18.</note>

<pb n="649"/>
“He looked on Jesus as He walked and saith, Behold the Lamb of God.” After this testimony
the two disciples who heard it followed Jesus; and Jesus turned and beheld them following,
and saith unto them, “What seek ye?” Perhaps it is not without significance that after six
testimonies John ceases from his witness-bearing and Jesus brings forward in the seventh
place His “What seek ye?” Very becoming in those who have been helped by John’s testimony
is the speech in which they address Christ as their Master, and declare their wish to see the
dwelling of the Son of God; for they say to Him, “Rabbi,” which answers to “Master,” in our
language, “where dwellest Thou?” And since every one that seeketh findeth, when John’s
disciples seek Jesus’ dwelling, Jesus shows it to them, saying, “Come and see.” By the word
“Come” He exhorts them perhaps to the practical part of life, while the “see” is to suggest
to them that that speculation which comes in the train of right conduct will be vouchsafed
to those who desire it; in Jesus’ dwelling they will have it. After they had asked where Jesus
dwells, and had followed the Master and had seen, they desired to stay with Him and to
spend that day with the Son of God. Now the number ten is a sacred one, not a few mysteries
being indicated by it; and so we are to understand that the mention of the tenth hour as that
at which these disciples turned in with Jesus, is not without significance. Of these disciples,
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, is one; and he having profited by this day with Jesus
and having found his own brother Simon (perhaps he had not found him before), told him
that he had found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ. It is written that “he that
seeketh findeth.” Now he had sought where Jesus dwelt, and had followed Him and looked
upon His dwelling; he stays with the Lord “at the tenth hour,” and finds the Son of God, the
Word, and Wisdom, and is ruled by Him as King. That is why he says, “We have found the
Messiah,” and this a thing which every one can say who has found this Word of God and
is ruled as by a king, by His Divinity. As a fruit he at once brings his brother to Christ, and
Christ deigned to look upon Simon, that is to say, by looking at him to visit and enlighten
his ruling principle; and Simon by Jesus’ looking at him was enabled to grow strong, so as
to earn a new name from that work of firmness and strength, and to be called Peter.</p>

<head>30. How John Was a Witness of Christ, and Specially of “The Light.”</head>
<p>It may be asked why we should have gone through all this when the verse before us is,
“He came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light.” But it was necessary to give
John’s testimonies to the light, and to show the order in which they took place, and also, in
order to show how effective John’s testimony proved, to set forth the help it afforded afterwards
to those to whom he bore it. But before all these testimonies there was an earlier one
when the Baptist leaped in the womb of Elisabeth at the greeting of Mary. That was a testimony
to Christ and attested His divine conception and birth. And what more need I say?
John is everywhere a witness and forerunner of Christ. He anticipates His birth and dies a
little before the death of the Son of God, and thus witnesses not only for those at the time
of the birth, but to those who were expecting the freedom which was to come for man
through the death of Christ. Thus, in all his life, he is a little before Christ, and everywhere
makes ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him. And John’s testimony precedes also
the second and diviner coming of Christ, for we read,4774 “If ye will receive it, this is Elijah
which is to come. He that hath ears to hear let him hear.” Now, there was a beginning, in
which the Word was,—and we saw from Proverbs that that beginning was wisdom,—and
the Word was in existence, and in the Word life was made, and the life was the light of men;
and all this being so, I ask why the man who came, sent from God, whose name was John,
why he came for witness to bear witness especially of the light? Why did he not come to
bear witness of the life, or of the Word, or about the beginning, or about any other of the
many aspects in which Christ appears? Consider here the texts, “The people which sat in
darkness saw a great light,” and “The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness overtook
it not,” and consider how those who are in darkness, that is, men, have need of light. For
if the light of men shines in darkness, and there is no active power in darkness to attain to
it, then we must partake of other aspects of Christ; at present we have no real share of Him
at all. For what share have we of life, we who are still in the body of death, and whose life
is hid with Christ in God?4775 “For when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we
also appear with Him in glory.” It was not possible, therefore, that he who came should
bear witness about a life which is still hid with Christ in God. Nor did he come for witness
to bear witness of the Word, for we know the Word who was in the beginning with God
and who is God the Word; for the Word was made flesh on the earth. And though the
witness had been, at least apparently, about the Word, it would in fact have been about the
Word made flesh and not about the word of God. He did not come, therefore, to bear witness
of the Word. And how could there be any witness-bearing about wisdom, to those who,
even if they appear to know something, cannot understand pure truth, but behold it through
<note type="footnote">4774 Matt. xi. 14, 15.</note>

<pb n="651"/>
a glass and in an enigma? It is likely, however, that before the second and diviner advent
of Christ, John or Elias will come to bear witness about life a little before Christ our life is
made manifest, and that then they will bear witness about the Word, and offer also their
testimony about wisdom. Some inquiry is necessary whether a testimony such as that of
John is to precede each of the aspects of Christ. So much for the words, “He came for witness,
to bear witness of the light.” What we are to understand by the further words, “That all
might believe through Him,” may be considered later.</p>

<head>Fragments of the Fourth Book. 4776</head>
<p>(Three Leaves from the Beginning.)</p>
<p>1. He who distinguishes in himself voice and meaning and things for which the meaning
stands, will not be offended at rudeness of language if, on enquiry, he finds the things spoken
of to be sound. The more may this be so when we remember how the holy men acknowledge
their speech and their preaching to be not in persuasion of the wisdom of words, but in
demonstration of the Spirit and of power.…
<del>Then, after speaking of the rudeness of style of the Gospel, he proceeds: </del></p>
<p>2. The Apostles are not unaware that in some things they give offence, and that in some
respects their culture is defective, and they confess themselves4777 accordingly to be rude
in speech but not in knowledge; for we must consider that the other Apostles would have
said this, too, as well as Paul. As for the text,4778 “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels,
that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us,” we interpret it in this way.
By “treasures” we understand here, as in other passages, the treasure of knowledge (gnosis)
and of hidden wisdom. By “earthen vessels” we understand the humble diction of the
Scriptures, which the Greek might so readily be led to despise, and in which the excellency
of God’s power appears so clearly. The mystery of the truth and the power of the things
said were not hindered by the humble diction from travelling to the ends of the earth, nor
from subduing to the word of Christ, not only the foolish things of the world, but sometimes
its wise things, too. For we see our calling,4779 not that no wise man according to the flesh,
but that not many wise according to the flesh. But Paul, in his preaching of the Gospel, is
a debtor4780 to deliver the word not to Barbarians only, but also to Greeks, and not only to
the unwise, who would easily agree with him, but also to the wise. For he was made sufficient4781
by God to be a minister of the New Covenant, wielding the demonstration of the
spirit and of power, so that when the believers agreed with him their belief should not be
in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. For, perhaps, if the Scripture possessed,
like the works the Greeks admire, elegance and command of diction, then it would be open
to suppose that not the truth of them had laid hold of men, but that the apparent sequence
and splendour of language had carried off the hearers, and had carried them off by guile.</p>

<p>You are not content to fulfil the office, when I am present with you, of a taskmaster to
drive me to labour at theology; even when I am absent you demand that I should spend
most of my time on you and on the task I have to do for you.4783 I, for my part, am inclined
to shrink from toil, and to avoid that danger which threatens from God those who give
themselves to writing on divinity; thus I would take shelter in Scripture in refraining from
making many books. For Solomon says in Ecclesiastes,4784 “My son, beware of making
many books; there is no end of it, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.” For we, except
that text have some hidden meaning which we do not yet perceive, have directly transgressed
the injunction, we have not guarded ourselves against making many books.</p>

<head>2. How Scripture Warns Us Against Making Many Books.</head>
<p>For, to judge by the words of the phrase, “My son, beware of making many books,” two
things appear to be indicated by it: first, that we ought not to possess many books, and then
that we ought not to compose many books. If the first is not the meaning the second must
be, and if the second is the meaning the first does not necessarily follow. In either case we
appear to be told that we ought not to make many books. I might take my stand on this
dictum which now confronts us, and send you the text as an excuse, and I might appeal in
support of this position to the fact that not even the saints found leisure to compose many
books; and thus I might cry off from the bargain we made with each other, and give up
writing what I was to send to you. You, on your side, would no doubt feel the force of the
text I have cited, and might, for the future, excuse me. But we must treat Scripture conscientiously,
and must not congratulate ourselves because we see the primary meaning of a text,
that we understand it altogether. I do not, therefore, shrink from bringing forward what
excuse I think I am able to offer for myself, and to point out the arguments, which you would
certainly use against me, if I acted contrary to our agreement. And in the first place, the
Sacred History seems to agree with the text in question, inasmuch as none of the saints
composed several works, or set forth his views in a number of books. I will take up this
point: when I proceed to write a number of books, the critic will remind me that even such
a one as Moses left behind him only five books.</p>

<head>3. The Apostles Wrote Little.4785</head>
<p>But he who was made fit to be a minister of the New Covenant, not of the letter, but of
the spirit, Paul, who fulfilled the Gospel from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum,4786 did
not write epistles to all the churches he taught, and to those to whom he did write he sent
no more than a few lines. And Peter, on whom the Church of Christ is built, against which
the gates of hell shall not prevail4787 left only one epistle of acknowledged genuineness.
Suppose we allow that he left a second; for this is doubtful. What are we to say of him who
leaned on Jesus’ breast, namely, John, who left one Gospel, though confessing4788 that he
could make so many that the world would not contain them? But he wrote also the Apocalypse,
being commanded to be silent and not to write the voices of the seven thunders.4789
But he also left an epistle of very few lines. Suppose also a second and a third, since not all
pronounce these to be genuine; but the two together do not amount to a hundred lines.</p>

a little, or not even a little, he goes on:</del>4790</p>

<p>4. I feel myself growing dizzy with all this, and wonder whether, in obeying you, I have
not been obeying God, nor walking in the footsteps of the saints, unless it be that my too
great love to you, and my unwillingness to cause you any pain, has led me astray and caused
me to think of all these excuses. We started from the words of the preacher, where he says:
“My son, beware of making many books.” With this I compare a saying from the Proverbs
of the same Solomon,4791 “In the multitude of words thou shalt not escape sin; but in sparing
thy lips thou shalt be wise.” Here I ask whether speaking many words of whatever kind is
a multitude of words (in the sense of the preacher), even if the many words a man speaks
are sacred and connected with salvation. If this be the case, and if he who makes use of
many salutary words is guilty of “multitude of words,” then Solomon himself did not escape
this sin, for “he spoke4792 three thousand proverbs, and five thousand songs, and he spoke
of trees from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the
wall, he spoke also of beasts and of fowl, and of creeping things and of fishes.” How, I may
ask, can any one give any course of instruction, without a multitude of words, using the
phrase in its simplest sense? Does not Wisdom herself say to those who are perishing,4793
“I stretched out my words, and ye heeded not”? Do we not find Paul, too, extending his
discourse from morning to midnight,4794 when Eutychus was borne down with sleep and
fell down, to the dismay of the hearers, who thought he was killed? If, then, the words are
true, “In much speaking thou wilt not escape sin,” and if Solomon was yet not guilty of great
sin when he discoursed on the subjects above mentioned, nor Paul when he prolonged his
discourse till midnight, then the question arises, What is that much speaking which is referred
to? and then we may pass on to consider what are the many books. Now the entire Word
of God, who was in the beginning with God, is not much speaking, is not words; for the
Word is one, being composed of the many speculations (theoremata), each of which is a
part of the Word in its entirety. Whatever words there be outside of this one, which
promise to give any description and exposition, even though they be words about truth,
none of these, to put it in a somewhat paradoxical way, is Word or Reason, they are all words
or reasons. They are not the monad, far from it; they are not that which agrees and is one
in itself, by their inner divisions and conflicts unity has departed from them, they have become
numbers, perhaps infinite numbers. We are obliged, therefore, to say that whoever
speaks that which is foreign to religion is using many words, while he who speaks the words
of truth, even should he go over the whole field and omit nothing, is always speaking the
one word. Nor are the saints guilty of much speaking, since they always have the aim in

<pb n="658"/>
view which is connected with the one word. It appears, then, that the much speaking which
is condemned is judged to be so rather from the nature of the views propounded, than from
the number of the words pronounced. Let us see if we cannot conclude in the same way
that all the sacred books are one book, but that those outside are the “many books” of the
preacher. The proof of this must be drawn from Holy Scripture, and it will be most satisfactorily
established if I am able to show that it is not only one book, taking the word now
in its commoner meaning, that we find to be written about Christ. Christ is written about
even in the Pentateuch; He is spoken of in each of the Prophets, and in the Psalms, and, in
a word, as the Saviour Himself says, in all the Scriptures. He refers us to them all, when He
says:4795 “Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and these are they
which testify of Me.” And if He refers us to the Scriptures as testifying of Him, it is not to
one that He sends us, to the exclusion of another, but to all that speak of Him, those which,
in the Psalms, He calls the chapter of the book, saying,4796 “In the chapter of the book it is
written of Me.” If any one proposes to take these words, “In the chapter of the book it is
written of Me,” literally, and to apply them to this or that special passage where Christ is
spoken of, let him tell us on what principle he warrants his preference for one book over
another. If any one supposes that we are doing something of this kind ourselves, and applying
the words in question to the book of Psalms, we deny that we do so, and we would urge that
in that case the words should have been, “In this book it is written of Me.” But He speaks
of all the books as one chapter, thus summing up in one all that is spoken of Christ for our
instruction. In fact the book was seen by John,4797 “written within and without, and sealed;
and no one could open it to read it, and to loose the seals thereof, but the Lion of the tribe
of Judah, the root of David, who has the key of David,4798 he that openeth and none shall
shut, and that shutteth and none shall open.” For the book here spoken of means the whole
of Scripture; and it is written within (lit. in front), on account of the meaning which is obvious,
and on the back, on account of its remoter and spiritual sense. Observe, in addition to
this, if a proof that the sacred writings are one book, and those of an opposite character
many, may not be found in the fact that there is one book of the living from which those
who have proved unworthy to be in it are blotted out, as it is written:4799 “Let them be
blotted out of the book of the living,” while of those who are to undergo the judgment, there
are books in the plural, as Daniel says:4800 “The judgment was set, and the books were

opened.” But Moses also bears witness to the unity of the sacred book, when he says:4801
“If Thou forgive the people their sins, forgive, but if not, then wipe me out of the book which
Thou hast written.” The passage in Isaiah,4802 too, I read in the same way. It is not peculiar
to his prophecy that the words of the book should be sealed, and should neither be read by
him who does not know letters, because he is ignorant of letters, nor by him who is learned,
because the book is sealed. This is true of every writing, for every written work needs the
reason (Logos) which closed it to open it. “He shall shut, and none shall open,”4803 and
when He opens no one can cast doubt on the interpretation He brings. Hence it is said that
He shall open and no man shall shut. I infer a similar lesson from the book spoken of in
Ezekiel,4804 in which was written lamentation, and a song, and woe. For the whole book is
full of the woe of the lost, and the song of the saved, and the lamentation of those between
these two. And John, too, when he speaks of his eating the one roll,4805 in which both front
and back were written on, means the whole of Scripture, one book which is, at first, most
sweet when one begins, as it were, to chew it, but bitter in the revelation of himself which
it makes to the conscience of each one who knows it. I will add to the proof of this an
apostolic saying which has been quite misunderstood by the disciples of Marcion, who,
therefore, set the Gospels at naught. The Apostle says:4806 “According to my Gospel in
Christ Jesus;” he does not speak of Gospels in the plural, and, hence, they argue that as the
Apostle only speaks of one Gospel in the singular, there was only one in existence. But they
fail to see that, as He is one of whom all the evangelists write, so the Gospel, though written
by several hands, is, in effect, one. And, in fact, the Gospel, though written by four, is one.
From these considerations, then, we learn what the one book is, and what the many books,
and what I am now concerned about is, not the quantity I may write, but the effect of what
I say, lest, if I fail in this point, and set forth anything against the truth itself, even in one of
my writings, I should prove to have transgressed the commandment, and to be a writer of
“many books.” Yet I see the heterodox assailing the holy Church of God in these days, under
the pretence of higher wisdom, and bringing forward works in many volumes in which they
offer expositions of the evangelical and apostolic writings, and I fear that if I should be silent
and should not put before our members the saving and true doctrines, these teachers might
get a hold of curious souls, which, in the absence of wholesome nourishment, might go after
food that is forbidden, and, in fact, unclean and horrible. It appears to me, therefore, to be

necessary that one who is able to represent in a genuine manner the doctrine of the Church,
and to refute those dealers in knowledge, falsely so-called, should take his stand against
historical fictions, and oppose to them the true and lofty evangelical message in which the
agreement of the doctrines, found both in the so-called Old Testament and in the so-called
New, appears so plainly and fully. You yourself felt at one time the lack of good representatives
of the better cause, and were impatient of a faith which was at issue with reason and
absurd, and you then, for the love you bore to the Lord, gave yourself to composition from
which, however, in the exercise of the judgment with which you are endowed, you afterwards
desisted. This is the defence which I think admits of being made for those who have the
faculty of speaking and writing. But I am also pleading my own cause, as I now devote
myself with what boldness I may to the work of exposition; for it may be that I am not endowed
with that habit and disposition which he ought to have who is fitted by God to be a
minister of the New Covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit.</p>

<head>1. The Work is Taken Up After a Violent Interruption, Which Has Driven the Writer

and Prayer for Guidance.</head>
<p>When a house is being built which is to be made as strong as possible, the building takes
place in fine weather and in calm, so that nothing may hinder the structure from acquiring
the needed solidity. And thus it turns out so strong and stable that it is able to withstand
the rush of the flood, and the dashing of the river, and all the agencies accompanying a
storm which are apt to find out what is rotten in a building and to show what parts of it
have been properly put together. And more particularly should that house which is capable
of sheltering the speculations of truth, the house of reason, as it were, in promise or in letters,
be built at a time when God can add His free co-operation to the projector of so noble a
work, when the soul is quiet and in the enjoyment of that peace which passes all understanding,
when she is turned away from all disturbance and not buffeted by any billows. This, it
appears to me, was well understood by the servants of the prophetic spirit and the ministers
of the Gospel message; they made themselves worthy to receive that peace which is in secret
from Him who ever gives it to them that are worthy and who said,4807 “Peace I leave with
you, My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you.” And look if some
similar lesson is not taught under the surface with regard to David and Solomon in the
narrative about the temple. David, who fought the wars of the Lord and stood firm against
many enemies, his own and those of Israel, desired to build a temple for God. But God,
through Nathan, prevents him from doing so, and Nathan says to him,4808 “Thou shalt not
build me an house, because thou art a man of blood.” But Solomon, on the other hand, saw
God in a dream, and in a dream received wisdom, for the reality of the vision was kept for
him who said, “Behold a greater than Solomon is here.” The time was one of the profoundest
peace, so that it was possible for every man to rest under his own vine and his own fig-tree,
and Solomon’s very name was significant of the peace which was in his days, for Solomon
means peaceful; and so he was at liberty to build the famous temple of God. About the time
of Ezra, also, when “truth conquers wine and the hostile king and women,”4809 the temple
of God is restored again. All this is said by way of apology to you, reverend Ambrosius. It
is at your sacred encouragement that I have made up my mind to build up in writing the
tower of the Gospel; and I have therefore sate down to count the cost,4810 if I have sufficient

to finish it, lest I should be mocked by the beholders, because I laid the foundation but was
not able to finish the work. The result of my counting, it is true, has been that I do not
possess what is required to finish it; yet I have put my trust in God, who enriches us4811
with all wisdom and all knowledge. If we strive to keep His spiritual laws we believe that
He does enrich us; He will supply what is necessary so that we shall get on with our building,
and shall even come to the parapet of the structure. That parapet it is which keeps from
falling those who go up on the house of the Word; for people only fall off those houses which
have no parapet, so that the buildings themselves are to blame for their fall and for their
death. We proceeded as far as the fifth volume in spite of the obstacles presented by the
storm in Alexandria, and spoke what was given us to speak, for Jesus rebuked the winds
and the waves of the sea. We emerged from the storm, we were brought out of Egypt, that
God delivering us who led His people forth from there. Then, when the enemy assailed us
with all bitterness by his new writings, so directly hostile to the Gospel, and stirred up against
us all the winds of wickedness in Egypt, I felt that reason called me rather to stand fast for
the conflict, and to save the higher part in me, lest evil counsels should succeed in directing
the storm so as to overwhelm my soul, rather to do this than to finish my work at an unsuitable
season, before my mind had recovered its calm. Indeed, the ready writers who usually
attended me brought my work to a stand by failing to appear to take down my words. But
now that the many fiery darts directed against me have lost their edge, for God extinguished
them, and my soul has grown accustomed to the dispensation sent me for the sake of the
heavenly word, and has learned from necessity to disregard the snares of my enemies, it is
as if a great calm had settled on me, and I defer no longer the continuation of this work. I
pray that God will be with me, and will speak as a teacher in the porch of my soul, so that
the building I have begun of the exposition of the Gospel of John may arrive at completion.
May God hear my prayer and grant that the body of the whole work may now be brought
together, and that no interruption may intervene which might prevent me from following
the sequence of Scripture. And be assured that it is with great readiness that I now make
this second beginning and enter on my sixth volume, because what I wrote before at Alexandria
has not, I know not by what chance, been brought with me. I feared I might neglect
this work, if I were not engaged on it at once, and therefore thought it better to make use
of this present time and begin without delay the part which remains. I am not certain if the
part formerly written will come to light, and would be very unwilling to waste time in
waiting to see if it does. Enough of preamble, let us now attend to our text.</p>

<head>2. How the Prophets and Holy Men of the Old Testament Knew the Things of Christ.</head>
<p>“And this is the witness of John.”4812 This is the second recorded testimony of John
the Baptist to Christ. The first begins with “This was He of whom I said, He that cometh
after me,” and goes down to “The only-begotten Son of God who is in the bosom of the
Father, He hath declared him.” Heracleon supposes the words, “No one has seen God at
any time,” etc., to have been spoken, not by the Baptist, but by the disciple. But in this he
is not sound. He himself allows the words, “Of his fulness we all received, and grace for
grace; for the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,” to have
been spoken by the Baptist. And does it not follow that the person who received of the fulness
of Christ, and a second grace in addition to that he had before, and who declared the law
to have been given by Moses, but grace and truth to have come through Jesus Christ, is it
not clear that this is the person who understood, from what he received from the fulness of
Christ, how “no one hath seen God at any time,” and how “the only-begotten who is in the
bosom of the Father” had delivered the declaration about God to him and to all those who
had received of His fulness? He was not declaring here for the first time Him that is in the
bosom of the Father, as if there had never before been any one fit to receive what he told
His Apostles. Does he not teach us that he was before Abraham, and that Abraham rejoiced
and was glad to see his day? The words “Of his fulness all we received,” and “Grace for
grace,” show, as we have already made clear, that the prophets also received their gift from
the fulness of Christ and received a second grace in place of that they had before; for they
also, led by the Spirit, advanced from the introduction they had in types to the vision of
truth. Hence not all the prophets, but many of them,4813 desired to see the things, which
the Apostles saw. For if there was a difference among the prophets, those who were perfect
and more distinguished of them did not desire to see what the Apostles saw, but actually
beheld them, while those who rose less fully than these to the height of the Word were filled
with longing for the things which the Apostles knew through Christ. The word “saw” we
have not taken in a physical sense, and the word “heard” we have taken to refer to a spiritual
communication; only he who has ears is prepared to hear the words of Jesus—a thing which
does not happen too frequently. There is the further point, that the saints before the bodily
advent of Jesus had an advantage over most believers in their insight into the mysteries of
divinity, since the Word of God was their teacher before He became flesh, for He was always
working , in imitation of His Father, of whom He says, “My father worketh hitherto.” On
this point we may adduce the words He addresses to the Sadducees, who do not believe the
<note type="footnote">4812 John i. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">4813 Matt. xiii. 17.</note>

<pb n="664"/>
doctrine of the resurrection. “Have you not read,” He says,4814 “what is said by God at the
Bush, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; He is not the
God of the dead but of the living.” If, then, God is not ashamed to be called the God of these
men, and if they are counted by Christ among the living, and if all believers are sons of Abraham,
4815 since all the Gentiles are blessed with faithful Abraham, who is appointed by
God to be a father of the Gentiles, can we hesitate to admit that those living persons made
acquaintance with the learning of living men, and were taught by Christ who was born before
the daystar,4816 before He became flesh? And for this cause they lived, because they had
part in Him who said, “I am the life,” and as the heirs of so great promises received the vision,
not only of angels, but of God in Christ. For they saw, it may be, the image of the invisible
God,4817 since he who hath seen the Son hath seen the Father, and so they are recorded to
have known God, and to have heard God’s words worthily, and, therefore, to have seen God
and heard Him. Now, I consider that those who are fully and really sons of Abraham are
sons of his actions, spiritually understood, and of the knowledge which was made manifest
to him. What he knew and what he did appears again in those who are his sons, as the
Scripture teaches those who have ears to hear,4818 “If ye were the children of Abraham, ye
would do the works of Abraham.” And if it is a true proverb4819 which says, “A wise man
will understand that which proceeds from his own mouth, and on his lips he will bear
prudence,” then we must at once repudiate some things which have been said about the
prophets, as if they were not wise men, and did not understand what proceeded from their
own mouths. We must believe what is good and true about the prophets, that they were
sages, that they did understand what proceeded from their mouths, and that they bore
prudence on their lips. It is clear indeed that Moses understood in his mind the truth (real
meaning) of the law, and the higher interpretations of the stories recorded in his books.
Joshua, too, understood the meaning of the allotment of the land after the destruction of
the nine and twenty kings, and could see better than we can the realities of which his
achievements were the shadows. It is clear, too, that Isaiah saw the mystery of Him who sat
upon the throne, and of the two seraphim, and of the veiling of their faces and their feet,
and of their wings, and of the altar and of the tongs. Ezekiel, too, understood the true significance
of the cherubim and of their goings, and of the firmament that was above them, and
of Him that sat on the throne, than all which what could be loftier or more splendid? I need

not enter into more particulars; the point I aim at establishing is clear enough already,
namely, that those who were made perfect in earlier generations knew not less than the
Apostles did of what Christ revealed to them, since the same teacher was with them as He
who revealed to the Apostles the unspeakable mysteries of godliness. I will add but a few
points, and then leave it to the reader to judge and to form what views he pleases on this
subject. Paul says in his Epistle to the Romans,4820 “Now, to him who is able to establish
you according to my Gospel, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been
kept in silence through times eternal, but is now made manifest by the prophetic Scriptures
and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.” For if the mystery concealed of old is made
manifest to the Apostles through the prophetic writings, and if the prophets, being wise
men, understood what proceeded from their own mouths, then the prophets knew what
was made manifest to the Apostles. But to many it was not revealed, as Paul says,4821 “In
other generations it was not made known to the sons of men as it hath now been revealed
unto His holy Apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs and
members of the same body.” Here an objection may be raised by those who do not share
the view we have propounded; and it becomes of importance to define what is meant by the
word “revealed.” It is capable of two meanings: firstly, that the thing in question is understood,
but secondly, if a prophecy is spoken of, that it is accomplished. Now, the fact that
the Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the
promise, was known to the prophets to this extent, that they knew the Gentiles were to fellowheirs
and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ. When this
should be, and why, and what Gentiles were spoken of, and how, though strangers from the
covenants, and aliens to the promises, they were yet to be members of one body and sharers
of the blessings; all this was known to the prophets, being revealed to them. But the things
prophesied belong to the future, and are not revealed to those who know them, but do not
witness their fulfilment, as they are to those who have the event before their eyes. And this
was the position of the Apostles. Thus, I conceive, they knew the events no more than the
fathers and the prophets did; and yet it is truly said of them that “what to other generations
was not revealed was now revealed to the Apostles and prophets, that the Gentiles were fellow-
heirs and members of the same body, and partakers in the promise of Christ.” For, in
addition to knowing these mysteries, they saw the power at work in the accomplished fact.
The passage, “Many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things ye see and did
not see them; and to hear the things ye hear and did not hear them,” may be interpreted in
the same way. They also desired to see the mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God,
and of His coming down to carry out the design of His suffering for the salvation of many,
<note type="footnote">4820 xvi. 25.</note>
<note type="footnote">4821 Ephes. iii. 5.</note>

<pb n="666"/>
actually put in operation. This may be illustrated from another quarter. Suppose one of
the Apostles to have understood the “unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man
to utter,”4822 but not to witness the glorious bodily appearing of Jesus to the faithful. which
is promised, although He desired to see it and suppose another had not only not4823 marked
and seen what that Apostle marked and saw, but had a much feebler grasp of the divine
hope, and yet is present at the second coming of our Saviour, which the Apostle, as in the
parallel above, had desired, but had not seen. We shall not err from the truth if we say that
both of these have seen what the Apostle, or indeed the Apostles, desired to see, and yet that
they are not on that account to be deemed wiser or more blessed than the Apostles. In the
same way, also, the Apostles are not to be deemed wiser than the fathers, or than Moses and
the prophets, than those in fact who, for their virtue, were found worthy of epiphanies and
of divine manifestations and of revelations of mysteries.</p>

<head>3. “Grace and Truth Came Through Jesus Christ.” These Words Belong to the
Baptist, Not the Evangelist. What the Baptist Testifies by Them.</head>
<p>We have lingered rather long over these discussions, but there is a reason for it. There
are many who, under the pretence of glorifying the advent of Christ, declare the Apostles
to be wiser than the fathers or the prophets; and of these teachers some have invented a
greater God for the later period, while some, not venturing so far, but moved, according to
their own account of the matter, by the difficulty connected with doctrine, cancel the whole
of the gift conferred by God on the fathers and the prophets, through Christ, through whom
all things were made. If all things were made through Him, clearly so must the splendid
revelations have been which were made to the fathers and prophets, and became to them
the symbols of the sacred mysteries of religion. Now the true soldiers of Christ must always
be prepared to do battle for the truth, and must never, so far as lies with them, allow false
convictions to creep in. We must not, therefore, neglect this matter. It may be said that
John’s earlier testimony to Christ is to be found in the words, “He who cometh after me
exists before me, for He was before me,” and that the words, “For of His fulness we all received,
and grace for grace,” are in the mouth of John the disciple. Now, we must show this
exposition to be a forced one, and one which does violence to the context; it is rather a strong
proceeding to suppose the speech of the Baptist to be so suddenly and, as it were, inopportunely
interrupted by that of the disciple, and it is quite apparent to any one who can judge,
in whatever small degree, of a context, that the speech goes on continuously after the words,
“This is He of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me exists before me, for He was before
me.” The Baptist brings a proof that Jesus existed before him because He was before him,
since He is the first-born of all creation; he says, “For of His fulness all we received.” That
is the reason why he says, “He exists before me, for He was before me.” That is how I know
that He is first and in higher honour with the Father, since of His fulness both I and the
prophets before me received the more divine prophetic grace instead of the grace we received
at His hands before in respect of our election. That is why I say, “He exists before me, for
He was before me,” because we know what we have received from His fulness; namely, that
the law was given through Moses, not by Moses, while grace and truth not only were given
but came into existence4824 through Jesus Christ. For His God and Father both gave the
law through Moses, and made grace and truth through Jesus Christ, that grace and truth
which came to man. If we give a reasonable interpretation to the words, “Grace and truth
came through Jesus Christ,” we shall not be alarmed at the possible discrepancy with them
of that other saying, “I am the way and the truth and the life.” If it is Jesus who says, “I am
the truth,” then how does the truth come through Jesus Christ, since no one comes into
existence through himself? We must recognize that this very truth, the essential truth, which
<note type="footnote">4824 ἐγένετο</note>

<pb n="668"/>
is prototypal, so to speak, of that truth which exists in souls endowed with reason, that truth
from which, as it were, images are impressed on those who care for truth, was not made
through Jesus Christ, nor indeed through any one, but by God;—just as the Word was not
made through any one which was in the beginning with the Father;—and as wisdom which
God created the beginning of His ways was not made through any one, so the truth also was
not made through any one. That truth, however, which is with men came through Jesus
Christ, as the truth in Paul and the Apostles came through Jesus Christ. And it is no wonder,
since truth is one, that many truths should flow from that one. The prophet David certainly
knew many truths, as he says,4825 “The Lord searcheth out truths,” for the Father of truth
searches out not the one truth but the many through which those are saved who possess
them. And as with the one truth and many truths, so also with righteousness and righteousnesses.
For the very essential righteousness is Christ, “Who was made to us of God wisdom
and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.” But from that righteousness is
formed the righteousness which is in each individual, so that there are in the saved many
righteousnesses, whence also it is written,4826 “For the Lord is righteous, and He loved
righteousnesses.” This is the reading in the exact copies, and in the other versions besides
the Septuagint, and in the Hebrew. Consider if the other things which Christ is said to be
in a unity admit of being multiplied in the same way and spoken of in the plural. For example,
Christ is our life as the Saviour Himself says,4827 “I am the way and the truth and
the life.” The Apostle, too, says,4828 “When Christ our life shall appear, then shall ye also
appear with Him in glory.” And in the Psalms again we find,4829 “Thy mercy is better than
life;” for it is on account of Christ who is life in every one that there are many lives. This,
perhaps, is also the key to the passage,4830 “If ye seek a proof of the Christ that speaketh in
me.” For Christ is found in every saint, and so from the one Christ there come to be many
Christs, imitators of Him and formed after Him who is the image of God; whence God says
through the prophet,4831 “Touch not my Christs.” Thus we have explained in passing the
passage which we appeared to have omitted from our exposition, viz.: “Grace and truth
came through Jesus Christ;” and we have also shown that the words belong to John the
Baptist and form part of his testimony to the Son of God.</p>

<head>4. John Denies that He is Elijah or “The” Prophet. Yet He Was “A” Prophet.</head>
<p>Now let us consider John’s second testimony. Jews from Jerusalem,4832 kindred to John
the Baptist, since he also belonged to a priestly race, send priests and levites to ask John who
he is. In saying, “I am not the Christ,” he made a confession of the truth. The words are
not, as one might suppose, a negation; for it is no negation to say, in the honour of Christ,
that one is not Christ. The priests and levites sent from Jerusalem, having there heard in
the first place that he is not the expected Messiah, put a question about the second great
personage whom they expected, namely, Elijah, whether John were he, and he says he is not
Elijah, and by his “I am not” makes a second confession of the truth. And, as many prophets
had appeared in Israel, and one in particular was looked for according to the prophecy of
Moses, who said,4833 “A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren,
like unto me, him shall ye hear; and it shall come to pass that every soul that shall not hear
that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people,” they, therefore, ask a third question,
not whether he is a prophet, but whether he is the prophet. Now, they did not apply this
name to the Christ, but supposed the prophet to be a second figure beside the Christ. But
John, on the contrary, who knew that He whose forerunner he was was both the Christ and
the prophet thus foretold, answered “No;” whereas, if they had asked if he was a prophet,
he would have answered “Yes;”4834 for he was not unconscious that he was a prophet. In
all these answers John’s second testimony to Christ was not yet completed; he had still to
give his questioners the answer they were to take back to those who sent them, and to declare
himself in the terms of the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, “The voice of one crying in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.”</p>

<head>5. There Were Two Embassies to John the Baptist; The Different Characters of
These.</head>
<p>Here the enquiry suggests itself whether the second testimony is concluded, and
whether there is a third, addressed to those who were sent from the Pharisees. They wished
to know why he baptized, if he was neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet; and he
said:4835 “I baptize with water; but there standeth one among you whom you know not,
He that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.” Is this a
third testimony, or is this which they were to report to the Pharisees a part of the second?
As far as the words allow me to conjecture I should say that the word to the emissaries of
the Pharisees was a third testimony. It is to be observed, however, that the first testimony
asserts the divinity of the Saviour, while the second disposes of the suspicion of those who
were in doubt whether John could be the Christ, and the third declares one who was already
present with men although they saw Him not, and whose coming was no longer in the future.
Before going on to the subsequent testimonies in which he points out Christ and witnesses
to Him, let us look at the second and third, word for word, and let us, in the first place, observe
that there are two embassies to the Baptist, one “from Jerusalem” from the Jews, who
send priests and levites, to ask him, “Who art thou?” the second sent by the Pharisees,4836
who were in doubt about the answer which had been made to the priests and levites. Observe
how what is said by the first envoys is in keeping with the character of priests and levites,
and shows gentleness and a willingness to learn. “Who art thou?” they say, and “What then?
art thou Elijah?” and “Art thou that prophet?” and then, “Who art thou, that we may give
an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?” There is nothing harsh or
arrogant in the enquiries of these men; everything agrees well with the character of true and
careful servants of God; and they raise no difficulties about the replies made to them. Those,
on the contrary, who are sent from the Pharisees assail the Baptist, as it were, with arrogant
and unsympathetic words: “Why then baptizest thou if thou be not the Christ nor Elijah
nor the prophet?” This mission is sent scarcely for the sake of information, as in the former
case of the priests and levites, but rather to debar the Baptist from baptizing, as if it were
thought that no one was entitled to baptize but Christ and Elijah and the prophet. The
student who desires to understand the Scripture must always proceed in this careful way;
he must ask with regard to each speech, who is the speaker and on what occasion it was
spoken. Thus only can we discern how speech harmonizes with the character of the speaker,
as it does all through the sacred books.</p>

<head>6. Messianic Discussion with John the Baptist.</head>
<p>Then the Jews sent priests and levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? And
he confessed and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.4837 What legates should
have been sent from the Jews to John, and where should they have been sent from? Should
they not have been men held to stand by the election of God above their fellows, and should
they not have come from that place which was chosen out of the whole of the earth, though
it is all called good, from Jerusalem where was the temple of God? With such honour, then,
do they enquire of John. In the case of Christ nothing of this sort is reported to have been
done by the Jews; but what the Jews do to John, John does to Christ, sending his own disciples
to ask him,4838 “Art thou He that should come, or do we look for another?” John confesses
to those sent to him, and denies not, and he afterwards declares, “I am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness;” but Christ, as having a greater testimony than John the Baptist,
makes His answer by words and deeds, saying, “Go and tell John those things which ye do
hear and see; the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and
the deaf hear, and the poor have the Gospel preached to them.” On this passage I shall, if
God permit, enlarge in its proper place. Here, however, it might be asked reasonably enough
why John gives such an answer to the question put to him. The priests and levites do not
ask him, “Art thou the Christ?” but “Who art thou?” and the Baptist’s reply to this question
should have been, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.” The proper reply to the
question, “Art thou the Christ?” is, “I am not the Christ;” and to the question, “Who art
thou?”—“The voice of one crying in the wilderness.” To this we may say that he probably
discerned in the question of the priests and levites a cautious reverence, which led them to
hint the idea in their minds that he who was baptizing might be the Christ, but withheld
them from openly saying so, which might have been presumptuous. He quite naturally,
therefore, proceeds in the first place to remove any false impressions they might have taken
up about him, and declares publicly the true state of the matter, “I am not the Christ.” Their
second question, and also their third, show that they had conceived some such surmise
about him. They supposed that he might be that second in honour to whom their hopes
pointed, namely, Elijah, who held with them the next position after Christ; and so when
John had answered, “I am not the Christ,” they asked, “What then? Art thou Elijah?” And
he said, “I am not.” They wish to know, in the third place, if he is the prophet, and on his
answer, “No,” they have no longer any name to give the personage whose advent they expected,
and they say, “Who art thou, then, that we may give an answer to them that sent us.
What sayest thou of thyself?” Their meaning is: “You are not, you say, any of those personages
whose advent Israel hopes and expects, and who you are, to baptize as you do, we do
<note type="footnote">4837 John i. 19, 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">4838 Matt. xi. 3.</note>

<pb n="672"/>
not know; tell us, therefore, so that we may report to those who sent us to get light upon
this point.” We add, as it has some bearing on the context, that the people were moved by
the thought that the period of Christ’s advent was near. It was in a manner imminent in
the years from the birth of Jesus and a little before, down to the publication of the preaching.
Hence it was, in all likelihood, that as the scribes and lawyers had deduced the time from
Holy Scripture and were expecting the Coming One, the idea was taken up by Theudas,
who came forward as the Messiah and brought together a considerable multitude, and after
him by the famous Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing.4839 Thus the coming of the
Messiah was more warmly expected and discussed, and it was natural enough for the Jews
to send priests and levites from Jerusalem to John, to ask him, “Who art thou?” and learn
if he professed to be the Christ.</p>

<head>7. Of the Birth of John, and of His Alleged Identity with Elijah. Of the Doctrine of
Transcorporation.</head>
<p>“And4840 they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? and he said, I am not.” No one
can fail to remember in this connection what Jesus says of John,4841 “If ye will receive it,
this is Elijah which is to come.” How, then, does John come to say to those who ask him,
“Art thou Elijah?”—“I am not.” And how can it be true at the same time that John is Elijah
who is to come, according to the words of Malachi,4842 “And behold I send unto you Elijah
the Tishbite, before the great and notable day of the Lord come, who shall restore the heart
of the father to the son, and the heart of a man to his neighbour, lest I come, and utterly
smite the earth.” The words of the angel of the Lord, too, who appeared to Zacharias, as he
stood at the right hand of the altar of incense, are somewhat to the same effect as the
prophecy of Malachi: “And4843 thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call
his name John.” And a little further on:4844 “And he shall go before His face in the spirit
and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to
the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him.” As for the
first point, one might say that John did not know that he was Elijah. This will be the explanation
of those who find in our passage a support for their doctrine of transcorporation, as
if the soul clothed itself in a fresh body and did not quite remember its former lives. These
thinkers will also point out that some of the Jews assented to this doctrine when they spoke
about the Saviour as if He was one of the old prophets, and had risen not from the tomb
but from His birth. His mother Mary was well known, and Joseph the carpenter was supposed
to be His father, and it could readily be supposed that He was one of the old prophets risen
from the dead. The same person will adduce the text in Genesis,4845 “I will destroy the
whole resurrection,” and will thereby reduce those who give themselves to finding in
Scripture solutions of false probabilities to a great difficulty in respect of this doctrine.
Another, however, a churchman, who repudiates the doctrine of transcorporation as a false
one, and does not admit that the soul of John ever was Elijah, may appeal to the abovequoted
words of the angel, and point out that it is not the soul of Elijah that is spoken of at
John’s birth, but the spirit and power of Elijah. “He shall go before him,” it is said, “in the
spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.” Now it can be
shown from thousands of texts that the spirit is a different thing from the soul, and that
<note type="footnote">4840 John i. 21.</note>

<note type="footnote">4842 Mal. iv. 5, 6.</note>

<note type="footnote">4844 Luke i. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">4845 vii. 4.</note>

<pb n="674"/>
what is called the power is a different thing from both the soul and the spirit. On these
points I cannot now enlarge; this work must not be unduly expanded. To establish the fact
that power is different from spirit, it will be enough to cite the text,4846 “The Holy Spirit
shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.” As for the
spirits of the prophets, these are given to them by God, and are spoken of as being in a
manner their property (slaves), as “The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,”4847
and “The spirit of Elijah rested upon Elisha.”4848 Thus, it is said, there is nothing absurd
in supposing that John, “in the spirit and power of Elijah,” turned the hearts of the fathers
to the children, and that it was on account of this spirit that he was called “Elijah who was
to come.” And to reinforce this view it may be argued that if the God of the universe identified
Himself with His saints to such an extent as to be called the God of Abraham and the
God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, much more might the Holy Spirit so identify Himself
with the prophets as to be called their spirit, so that when the spirit is spoken of it might be
the spirit of Elijah or the spirit of Isaiah. Our churchman, to go on with his views, may
further say that those who supposed Jesus to be one of the prophets risen from the dead
were probably misled, partly by the doctrine above mentioned, and partly by supposing
Him to be one of the prophets, and that as for this misconception that He was one of the
prophets, these persons probably fell into their error from not knowing about Jesus’ supposed
father and actual mother, and considering that He had risen from the tombs. As for the
text in Genesis about the resurrection, the churchman will rejoin with a text to an opposite
effect, “God hath raised up for me another seed in place of Abel whom Cain slew;”4849
showing that the resurrection occurs in Genesis. As for the first difficulty which was raised,
our churchman will meet the view of the believers in transcorporation by saying that John
is no doubt, in a certain sense, as he has already shown, Elijah who is to come; and that the
reason why he met the enquiry of the priests and levites with “I am not,” was that he divined
the object they had in view in making it. For the enquiry laid before John by the priests and
levites was not intended to bring out whether the same spirit was in both, but whether John
was that very Elijah who was taken up, and who now appeared according to the expectation
of the Jews without being born (for the emissaries, perhaps, did not know about John’s
birth); and to such all enquiry he naturally answered, “I am not;” for he who was called John
was not Elijah who was taken up, and had not changed his body for his present appearance.
Our first scholar, whose view of transcorporation we have seen based upon our passage,
may go on with a close examination of the text, and urge against his antagonist, that if John

<pb n="675"/>
was the son of such a man as the priest Zacharias, and if he was born when his parents were
both aged, contrary to all human expectation, then it is not likely that so many Jews at Jerusalem
would be so ignorant about him, or that the priests and levites whom they sent would
not be acquainted with the facts of his birth. Does not Luke declare4850 that “fear came
upon all those who lived round about,”—clearly round about Zacharias and Elisabeth—and
that “all these things were noised abroad throughout the whole hill country of Judæa”? And
if John’s birth from Zacharias was a matter of common knowledge, and the Jews of Jerusalem
yet sent priests and levites to ask, “Art thou Elijah?” then it is clear that in saying this they
assumed the doctrine of transcorporation to be true, and that it was a current doctrine of
their country, and not foreign to their secret teaching. John therefore says, I am not Elijah,
because he does not know about his own former life. These thinkers, accordingly, entertain
an opinion which is by no means to be despised. Our churchman, however, may return to
the charge, and ask if it is worthy of a prophet, who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, who
is predicted by Isaiah, and whose birth was foretold before it took place by so great an angel,
one who has received of the fulness of Christ, who shares in such a grace, who knows truth
to have come through Jesus Christ, and has taught such deep things about God and about
the only-begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father, is it worthy of such a one to lie, or
even to hesitate, out of ignorance of what he was. For with respect to what was obscure, he
ought to have refrained from confessing, and to have neither affirmed nor denied the proposition
put before him. If the doctrine in question really was widely current, ought not
John to have hesitated to pronounce upon it, lest his soul had actually been in Elijah? And
here our churchman will appeal to history, and will bid his antagonists ask experts of the
secret doctrines of the Hebrews, if they do really entertain such a belief. For if it should
appear that they do not, then the argument based on that supposition is shown to be quite
baseless. Our churchman, however, is still free to have recourse to the solution given before,
and to insist that attention be paid to the meaning with which the question was put. For if,
as I showed, the senders knew John to be the child of Zacharias and Elisabeth, and if the
messengers still more, being men of priestly race, could not possibly be ignorant of the remarkable
manner in which their kinsman Zacharias had received his son, then what could
be the meaning of their question, “Art thou Elijah?” Had they not read that Elijah had been
taken up into heaven, and did they not expect him to appear? Then, as they expect Elijah
to come at the consummation before Christ, and Christ to follow him, perhaps their question
was meant less in a literal than in a tropical sense: Are you he who announces beforehand
the word which is to come before Christ, at the consummation? To this he very properly
answers, “I am not.” The adversary, however, tries to show that the priests could not be ignorant
that the birth of John had taken place in so remarkable a manner, because “all these
<note type="footnote">4850 Luke i. 65.</note>

<pb n="676"/>
things had been much spoken of in the hill country of Judæa;” and the churchman has to
meet this. He does so by showing that a similar mistake was widely current about the Saviour
Himself; for “some said that He was John the Baptist, others Elijah, others Jeremiah or one
of the prophets.”4851 So the disciples told the Lord when He was in the parts of Cæsarea
Philippi, and questioned them on that subject. And Herod, too, said,4852 “John whom I
beheaded, he is risen from the dead;” so that he appears not to have known what was said
about Christ, as reported in the Gospel,4853 “Is not this the son of the carpenter, is not His
mother called Mary, and His brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? And His
sisters, are they not all with us?” Thus in the case of the Saviour, while many knew of His
birth from Mary, others were under a mistake about Him; and so in the case of John, there
is no wonder if, while some knew of his birth from Zacharias, others were in doubt whether
the expected Elijah had appeared in him or not. There was not more room for doubt about
John, whether he was Elijah, than about the Saviour, whether He was John. Of the two, the
question of the outward form of Elijah could be disposed of from the words of Scripture,
though not from actual observation, for we read,4854 “He was a hairy man, and girt with a
leather girdle about his loins.” John’s outward appearance, on the contrary, was well known,
and was not like that of Jesus; and yet there were those who surmised that John had risen
from the dead, and taken the name of Jesus. As for the change of name, a thing which reminds
us of mysteries, I do not know how the Hebrews came to tell about Phinehas, son of
Eleazar, who admittedly prolonged his life to the time of many of the judges, as we read in
the Book of Judges,4855 to tell about him what I now mention. They say that he was Elijah,
because he had been promised immortality (in Numbers4856), on account of the covenant
of peace granted to him because he was jealous with a divine jealousy, and in a passion of
anger pierced the Midianitish woman and the Israelite, and stayed the wrath of God as it is
called, as it is written, “Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, hath turned my wrath
away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them.” No
wonder, then, if those who conceived Phinehas and Elijah to be the same person, whether
they judged soundly in this or not, for that is not now the question, considered John and
Jesus also to be the same. This, then, they doubted, and desired to know if John and Elijah

were the same. At another time than this, the point would certainly call for a careful enquiry,
and the argument would have to be well weighed as to the essence of the soul, as to the
principle of her composition, and as to her entering into this body of earth. We should also
have to enquire into the distributions of the life of each soul, and as to her departure from
this life, and whether it is possible for her to enter into a second life in a body or not, and
whether that takes place at the same period, and after the same arrangement in each case,
or not; and whether she enters the same body, or a different one, and if the same, whether
the subject remains the same while the qualities are changed, or if both subject and qualities
remain the same, and if the soul will always make use of the same body or will change it.
Along with these questions, it would also be necessary to ask what transcorporation is, and
how it differs from incorporation, and if he who holds transcorporation must necessarily
hold the world to be eternal. The views of these scholars must also be taken into account,
who consider that, according to the Scriptures, the soul is sown along with the body, and
the consequences of such a view must also be looked at. In fact the subject of the soul is a
wide one, and hard to be unravelled, and it has to be picked out of scattered expressions of
Scripture. It requires, therefore, separate treatment. The brief consideration we have been
led to give to the problem in connection with Elijah and John may now suffice; we go on to
what follows in the Gospel.</p>

<head>8. John is a Prophet, But Not the Prophet.</head>
<p>“Art thou that prophet? And he answered No.”4857 If the law and the prophets were
until John,4858 what can we say that John was but a prophet? His father Zacharias, indeed,
says, filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesying,4859 “And thou, child, shalt be called the
prophet of the Highest, for thou shalt go before the Lord to prepare His ways.” (One might
indeed get past this passage by laying stress on the word called: he is to be called, he is not
said to be, a prophet.) And still more weighty is it that the Saviour said to those who considered
John to be a prophet,4860 “But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto
you, and more than a prophet.” The words, Yea, I say unto you, manifestly affirm that John
is a prophet, and that is nowhere denied afterwards. If, then, he is said by the Saviour to be
not only a prophet but “more than a prophet,” how is it that when the priests and levites
come and ask him, “Art thou the Prophet?” he answers No! On this we must remark that
it is not the same thing to say, “Art thou the Prophet?” and “Art thou a prophet?” The distinction
between the two expressions has already been observed, when we asked what was
the difference between the God and God, and between the Logos and Logos.4861 Now it is
written in Deuteronomy,4862 “A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like
me; Him shall ye hear, and it shall be that every soul that will not hear that prophet shall be
cut off from among His people.” There was, therefore, an expectation of one particular
prophet having a resemblance to Moses in mediating between God and the people and receiving
a new covenant from God to give to those who accepted his teaching; and in the
case of each of the prophets, the people of Israel recognized that he was not the person of
whom Moses spoke. As, then, they doubted about John, whether he were not the Christ,4863
so they doubted whether he could not be the prophet. And there is no wonder that those
who doubted about John whether he were the Christ, did not understand that the Christ
and the prophet are the same person; their doubt as to John necessarily implied that they
were not clear on this point. Now the difference between “the prophet” and “a prophet”
has escaped the observation of most students; this is the case with Heracleon, who says, in
these very words: “As, then, John confessed that he was not the Christ, and not even a
prophet, nor Elijah.” If he interpreted the words before us in such a way, he ought to have
examined the various passages to see whether in saying that he is not a prophet nor Elijah

<head>10. Of the Voice John the Baptist is.</head>
<p>“He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the
Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.” As He who is peculiarly the Son of God, being no other
than the Logos, yet makes use of Logos (reason)—for He was the Logos in the beginning,
and was with God, the Logos of God—so John, the servant of that Logos, being, if we take
the Scripture to mean what it says, no other than a voice, yet uses his voice to point to the
Logos. He, then, understanding in this way the prophecy about himself spoken by Isaiah
the prophet, says he is a voice, not crying in the wilderness, but “of one crying in the wilderness,”
of Him, namely, who stood and cried,4864 “If any man thirst, let him come unto Me
and drink.” He it was, too, who said,4865 “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths
straight. Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and
all the crooked shall be made straight.” For as we read in Exodus that God said to Moses,4866
“Behold I have given thee for a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet;”
so we are to understand—the cases are at least analogous if not altogether similar—it is with
the Word in the beginning, who is God, and with John. For John’s voice points to that word
and demonstrates it. It is therefore a very appropriate punishment that falls on Zacharias
on his saying to the angel,4867 “Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man and my
wife well stricken in years.” For his want of faith with regard to the birth of the voice, he is
himself deprived of his voice, as the angel Gabriel says to him, “Behold, thou shalt be silent
and not able to speak until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou hast
not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.” And afterwards when he
had “asked for a writing tablet and written, His name is John; and they all marvelled,” he
recovered his voice; for “his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue, and he spake,
blessing God.” We discussed above how it is to be understood that the Logos is the Son of
God, and went over the ideas connected with that; and a similar sequence of ideas is to be
observed at this point. John came for a witness; he was a man sent from God to bear witness
of the light, that all men through him might believe; he was that voice, then, we are to understand,
which alone was fitted worthily to announce the Logos. We shall understand this
aright if we call to mind what was adduced in our exposition of the texts: “That all might
believe through Him,” and “This is he of whom it is written, Behold I send My messenger
before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.”4868 There is fitness, too, in his being
said to be the voice, not of one saying in the wilderness, but of one crying in the wilderness.

He who cries, “Prepare ye the way of the Lord,” also says it; but he might say it without
crying it. But he cries and shouts it, that even those may hear who are at a distance from
the speaker, and that even the deaf may understand the greatness of the tidings, since it is
announced in a great voice; and he thus brings help, both to those who have departed from
God and to those who have lost the acuteness of their hearing. This, too, was the reason
why “Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.”
Hence, too,4869 “John beareth witness of Him, and cried, saying,” “Hence also God commands
Isaiah to cry, with the voice of one saying, Cry. And I said, What shall I cry?” The physical
voice we use in prayer need not be great nor startling; even should we not lift up any great
cry or shout, God will yet hear us. He says to Moses,4870 “Why criest thou unto Me?” when
Moses had not cried audibly at all. It is not recorded in Exodus that he did so; but Moses
had cried mightily to God in prayer with that voice which is heard by God alone. Hence
David also says,4871 “With my voice I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.” And one
who cries in the desert has need of a voice, that the soul which is deprived of God and
deserted of truth—and what more dreadful desert is there than a soul deserted of God and
of all virtue, since it still goes crookedly and needs instruction—may be exhorted to make
straight the way of the Lord. And that way is made straight by the man who, far from
copying the serpent’s crooked journey; while he who is of the contrary disposition perverts
his way. Hence the rebuke directed to a man of this kind and to all who resemble him, “Why
pervert ye the right ways of the Lord?”4872</p>

<head>11. Of the Way of the Lord, How It is Narrow, and How Jesus is the Way.</head>
<p>Now the way of the Lord is made straight in two fashions. First, in the way of contemplation,
when thought is made clear in truth without any mixture of falsehood; and then in
the way of conduct, after the sound contemplation of what ought to be done, when action
is produced which harmonizes with sound theory of conduct. And that we may the more
clearly understand the text, “Make straight the way of the Lord,” it will be well to compare
with it what is said in the Proverbs,4873 “Depart not, either to the right hand or to the left.”
For he who deviates in either direction has given up keeping his path straight, and is no
longer worthy of regard, since he has gone apart from the straightness of the journey, for
“the Lord4874 is righteous, and loves righteousness, and His face beholds straightness.”
Hence he who is the object of regard, and receives the benefit that comes from this oversight,
says,4875 “The light of Thy countenance was shown upon us, O Lord.” Let us stand, then,
as Jeremiah4876 exhorts, upon the ways, and let us see and ask after the ancient ways of the
Lord, and let us see which is the good way, and walk in it. Thus did the Apostles stand and
ask for the ancient ways of the Lord; they asked the Patriarchs and the Prophets, enquiring
into their writings, and when they came to understand these writings they saw the good
way, namely, Jesus Christ, who said, “I am the way,” and they walked in it. For it is a good
way that leads the good man to the good father, the man who, from the good treasure of his
heart, brings forth good things, and who is a good and faithful servant. This way is narrow,
indeed, for the many cannot bear to walk in it and are lovers of their flesh; but it is also hardpressed4877
by those who use violence4878 to walk in it, for it is not called afflicting, but afflicted.
4879 For that way which is a living way, and feels the qualities of those who tread it,
is pressed and afflicted, when he travels on it who has not taken off his shoes from off his
feet,4880 nor truly realized that the place on which he stands. or indeed treads, is holy ground.
And it will lead to Him who is the life, and who says, “I am the life.” For the Saviour, in
whom all virtues are combined, has many aspects. To him who, though by no means near
the end, is yet advancing, He is the way; to him who has put off all that is dead He is the
life. He who travels on this way is told to take nothing with him on it, since it provides

<head>12. Heracleon’s View of the Voice, and of John the Baptist.</head>
<p>The words, however, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,” etc., may be taken
as equivalent to “I am He of whom the ‘voice in the wilderness’ is written.” Then John would
be the person crying, and his voice would be that crying in the wilderness, “Make straight
the way of the Lord.” Heracleon, discussing John and the prophets, says, somewhat slanderously,
that “the Word is the Saviour; the voice, that in the wilderness which John interpreted;
the sound is the whole prophetic order.” To this we may reply by reminding him of the
text,4881 “If the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle,”
and that which says that though a man have knowledge of mysteries, or have prophecy but
wants love, he is a sounding or a tinkling cymbal.4882 If the prophetic voice be nothing but
sound, how does our Lord come to refer us to it as where He says,4883 “Search the Scriptures,
for in them you think you have eternal life, and these are they which bear witness,” and4884
“If ye believed Moses, ye would believe Me,” and4885 “Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning
you, saying, This people honours me with their lips”? I do not know if any one can reasonably
admit that the Saviour thus spoke in praise of an uncertain sound, or that there is any preparation
to be had from the Scriptures to which we are referred as from the voice of a
trumpet, for our war against opposing powers, should their sound give an uncertain voice.
If the prophets had not love, and if that is why they were sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal,
then how does the Lord send us to their sound, as these writers will have it, as if we could
get help from that? He asserts, indeed, that a voice, when well fitted to speech, becomes
speech, as if one should say that a woman is turned into a man; and the assertion is not
supported by argument. And, as if he were in a position to put forth a dogma on the subject
and to get on in this way, he declares that sound can be changed in a similar way into voice,
and the voice, which is changed into speech, he says, is in the position of a disciple, while
sound passing into voice is in that of a slave. If he had taken any kind of trouble to establish
these points we should have had to devote some attention to refuting them; but as it is, the
bare denial is sufficient refutation. There was a point some way back which we deferred
taking up, that, namely, of the motive of John’s speeches. We may now take it up. The Saviour,
according to Heracleon, calls him both a prophet and Elijah, but he himself denies
that he is either of these. When the Saviour, Heracleon says, calls him a prophet and Elijah,
He is speaking not of John himself, but of his surroundings; but when He calls him greater
than the prophets and than those who are born of women, then He is describing the character

<pb n="686"/>
of John himself. When John, on the other hand, is asked about himself, his answers relate
to himself, not to his surroundings. This we have examined as carefully as possible, comparing
each of the terms in question with the statements of Heracleon, lest he should not
have expressed himself quite accurately. For how it comes that the statements that he is
Elijah and that he is a prophet apply to those about him, but the statement that he is the
voice of one crying in the wilderness, to himself, no attempt whatever is made to show.
Heracleon only gives an illustration, namely, this: His surroundings were, so to speak, his
clothes, and other than himself, and when he was asked about his clothes, if he were his
clothes, he could not answer “Yes.” Now that his being Elijah, who was to come, was his
clothes, is scarcely consistent, so far as I can see, with Heracleon’s views; it might consist,
perhaps, with the exposition we ourselves gave of the words, “In the spirit and power of
Elijah;” it might, in a sense, be said that this spirit of Elijah is equivalent to the soul of John.
He then goes on to try to determine why those who were sent by the Jews to question John
were priests and levites, and he answers by no means badly, that it was incumbent on such
persons, being devoted to the service of God, to busy themselves and to make enquiries
about such matters. When he goes on, however, to say that it was “because John was of the
levitical tribe,” this is less well considered. We raised the question ourselves above, and saw
that if the Jews who were sent knew John’s birth, it was not open to them to ask if he was
Elijah. Then, again, in dealing with the question, “Art thou the prophet?” Heracleon does
not regard the addition of the article as having any special force, and says, “They asked him
if he were a prophet, wishing to know this more general fact.” Again, not Heracleon alone,
but, so far as I am informed, all those who diverge from our views, as if they had not been
able to deal with a trifling ambiguity and to draw the proper distinction, suppose John to
be greater than Elijah and than all the prophets. The words are, “Of those born of women
there is none greater than John;” but this admits of two meanings, that John is greater than
they all, or again, that some of them are equal to him. For though many of the prophets
were equal to him, still it might be true in respect of the grace bestowed on him, that none
of them was greater than he. He regards it as confirming the view that John was greater,
that “he is predicted by Isaiah;” for no other of all those who uttered prophecies was held
worthy by God of this distinction. This, however, is a venturesome statement and implies
some disrespect of what is called the Old Testament, and total disregard of the fact that
Elijah himself was the subject of prophecy. For Elijah is prophesied by Malachi, who says,4886
“Behold, I send unto you Elijah, the Tishbite, who shall restore the heart of the father to the
son.” Josiah, too, as we read in third Kings,4887 was predicted by name by the prophet who
came out of Judah; for he said, Jeroboam also being present at the altar, “Thus saith the
<note type="footnote">4886 iv. 5, 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">4887 1 Kings xiii. 2.</note>

<pb n="687"/>
Lord, Behold a son is born to David, his name is Josiah.” There are some also who say that
Samson was predicted by Jacob, when he said,4888 “Dan shall judge his own people, he is
as one tribe in Israel,” for Samson who judged Israel was of the tribe of Dan. So much by
way of evidence of the rashness of the statement that John alone was the subject of prophecy,
made by Heracleon in his attempted explanation of the words, “I am the voice of one crying
in the wilderness.”</p>

<head>13. John I. 24, 25. Of the Baptism of John, that of Elijah, and that of Christ.</head>
<p>And they that were sent were of the Pharisees. And they asked him, and said unto
him,4889 “Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”
Those who sent from Jerusalem the priests and levites who asked John these questions,
having learned who John was not, and who he was, preserve a decent silence, as if tacitly
assenting and indicating that they accepted what was said, and saw that baptism was suited
to a voice crying in the wilderness for the preparing of the way of the Lord. But the Pharisees
being, as their name indicates, a divided and seditious set of people, show that they do not
agree with the Jews of the metropolis and with the ministers of the service of God, the priests
and levites. They send envoys who deal in rebukes, and so far as their power extends debar
him from baptizing; their envoys ask, Why baptizest thou, then, if thou art not the Christ,
nor Elijah, nor the prophet? And if we were to stitch together into one statement what is
written in the various Gospels, we should say that at this time they spoke as is here reported,
but that at a later time, when they wished to received baptism, they heard the address of
John:4890 “Generations of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance.” This is what the Baptist says in Matthew,
when he sees many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, without, it is
clear, having the fruits of repentance, and pharisaically boasting in themselves that they had
Abraham for their father. For this they are rebuked by John, who has the zeal of Elijah according
to the communication of the Holy Spirit. For that is a rebuking word, “Think not
to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father,” and that is the word of a
teacher, when he speaks of those who for their stony hearts are called unbelieving stones,
and says that by the power of God these stones may be changed into children of Abraham;
for they were present to the eyes of the prophet and did not shrink from his divine glance.
Hence his words: “I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to
Abraham.” And since they came to his baptism without having done fruits meet for repentance,
he says to them most appropriately, “Already is the axe laid to the root of the tree;
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.” This is
as much as to say to them: Since you have come to baptism without having done fruits meet
for repentance, you are a tree that does not bring forth good fruit and which has to be cut
down by the most sharp and piercing axe of the Word which is living and powerful and
sharper than every two-edged sword. The estimation in which the Pharisees held themselves
is also set forth by Luke in the passage:4891 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, the
one a Pharisee and the other a publican. And the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
<note type="footnote">4889 John i. 24, 25.</note>

<pb n="689"/>
himself: God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
or even as this publican.” The result of this speech is that the publican goes down to his
house justified rather than the Pharisee, and the lesson is drawn, that every one who exalts
himself is abased. They came, then, in the character in which the Saviour’s reproving words
described them, as hypocrites to John’s baptism, nor does it escape the Baptist’s observation
that they have the poison of vipers under their tongue and the poison of asps, for “the
poison of asps is under their tongue.”4892 The figure of serpents rightly indicates their
temper, and it is plainly revealed in their better question: “Why baptizest thou then, if thou
art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” To these I would fain reply, if it be the case
that the Christ and Elijah and the prophet baptize, but that the voice crying in the wilderness
has no authority to do so, “Most harshly, my friends, do you question the messenger sent
before the face of Christ to prepare His way before Him. The mysteries which belong to
this point are all hidden to you; for Jesus being, whether you will or not, the Christ, did not
Himself baptize but His disciples, He who was Himself the prophet. And how have you
come to believe that Elijah who is to come will baptize?” He did not baptize the logs upon
the altar in the times of Ahab,4893 though they needed such a bath to be burned up, what
time the Lord appeared in fire. No, he commands the priests to do this for him, and that
not only once; for he says, “Do it a second time,” upon which they did it a second time, and
“Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time. If, then, he did not at that time himself
baptize but left the work to others, how was he to baptize at the time spoken of by Malachi?
Christ, then, does not baptize with water, but His disciples. He reserves for Himself to
baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. Now Heracleon accepts the speech of the Pharisees
as distinctly implying that the office of baptizing belonged to the Christ and Elijah and to
every prophet, for he uses these words, “Whose office alone it is to baptize.” He is refuted
by what we have just said, and especially by the consideration that he takes the word
“prophet” in a general sense;4894 for he cannot show that any of the prophets baptized. He
adds, not incorrectly, that the Pharisees put the question from malice, and not from a desire
to learn.</p>

<head>14. Comparison of the Statements of the Four Evangelists Respecting John the
Baptist, the Prophecies Regarding Him, His Addresses to the Multitude and to
the Pharisees, Etc.</head>
<p>We deem it necessary to compare with the expression of the passage we are considering
the similar expressions found elsewhere in the Gospels. This we shall continue to do point
by point to the end of this work, so that terms which appear to disagree may be shown to
be in harmony, and that the peculiar meanings present in each may be explained. This we
shall do in the present passage. The words, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make
straight the way of the Lord,” are placed by John, who was a disciple, in the mouth of the
Baptist. In Mark, on the other hand, the same words are recorded at the beginning of the
Gospel of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the Scripture of Isaiah, as thus: “The beginning
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send My messenger
before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee. The voice of one crying in
the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.” Now the words,
“Make straight the way of the Lord,” added by John, are not found in the prophet. Perhaps
John was seeking to compress the “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths
of our God,” and so wrote, “Make straight the way of the Lord;” while Mark combined two
prophecies spoken by two different prophets in different places, and made one prophecy
out of them, “As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold I send My messenger before thy
face, who shall prepare thy way. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
way of the Lord, make His paths straight.” The words, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness,”
are written immediately after the narrative of Hezekiah’s recovery from his sickness,
4895 while the words, “Behold I send My messenger before thy face,” are written by
Malachi.4896 What John does here, abbreviating the text he quotes, we find done by Mark
also at another point. For while the words of the prophet are, “Prepare ye the way of the
Lord, make straight the paths of our God,” Mark writes, “Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make His paths straight.” And John practises a similar abbreviation in the text, “Behold I
send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee,” when he does
not add the words “before thee,” as in the original. Coming now to the statement, “They
were sent from the Pharisees and they asked Him,”4897 we have been led by our examination
of the passage to prefix the enquiry of the Pharisees—which Matthew does not mention—to
the occurrence recorded in Matthew, when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees
coming to his baptism, and said to them, “Ye generations of vipers,” etc. For the natural
sequence is that they should first enquire and then come. And we have to observe how,

<note type="footnote">4896 iii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">4897 John i. 24.</note>

<pb n="691"/>
when Matthew reports that there went out to John Jerusalem and all Judæa, and all the region
round about Jordan, to be baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins, it was not these
people who heard from the Baptist any word of rebuke or refutation, but only those many
Pharisees and Sadducees whom he saw coming. They it was who were greeted with the
address, “Ye offspring of vipers,” etc.4898 Mark, again, does not record any words of reproof
as having been used by John to those who came to him, being all the country of Judæa and
all of them of Jerusalem, who were baptized by him in the Jordan and confessed their sins.
This is because Mark does not mention the Pharisees and Sadducees as having come to
John. A further circumstance which we must mention is that both Matthew and Mark state
that, in the one case, all Jerusalem and all Judæa, and the whole region round about Jordan,
in the other, the whole land of Judæa and all they of Jerusalem, were baptized, confessing
their sins; but when Matthew introduces the Pharisees and Sadducees as coming to the
baptism, he does not say that they confessed their sins, and this might very likely and very
naturally be the reason why they were addressed as “offspring of vipers.” Do not suppose,
reader, that there is anything improper in our adducing in our discussion of the question
of those who were sent from the Pharisees and put questions to John, the parallel passages
from the other Gospels too. For if we have indicated the proper connection between the
enquiry of the Pharisees, recorded by the disciple John, and their baptism which is found
in Matthew, we could scarcely avoid inquiring into the passages in question, nor recording
the observations made on them. Luke, like Mark, remembers the passage, “The voice of
one crying in the wilderness,” but he for his part treats it as follows:4899 “The word of God
came unto John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. And he came into all the region
round about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins; as it is
written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.” Luke, however, added the
continuation of the prophecy: “Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill
shall be brought low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough ways smooth,
and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.” He writes, like Mark, “Make His ways straight;”
curtailing, as we saw before, the text, “Make straight the ways of our God.” In the phrase,
“And all the crooked shall become straight,” he leaves out the “all,” and the word “straight”
he converts from a plural into a singular. Instead of the phrase, moreover, “The rough land
into a plain,” he gives, “The rough ways into smooth ways,” and he leaves out “And the
glory of the Lord shall be revealed,” and gives what follows, “And all flesh shall see the salvation
of God.” These observations are of use as showing how the evangelists are accustomed
to abbreviate the sayings of the prophets. It has also to be observed that the speech, “Off-
<note type="footnote">4898 Matt. iii. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">4899 Luke iii. 2.</note>

<pb n="692"/>
spring of vipers,” etc., is said by Matthew to have been spoken to the Pharisees and Sadducees
when coming to baptism, they being a different set of people from those who confessed
their sins, and to whom no words of this kind were spoken. With Luke, on the contrary,
these words were addressed to the multitudes who came out to be baptized by John, and
there were not two divisions of those who were baptized, as we found in Matthew. But
Matthew, as the careful observer will see, does not speak of the multitudes in the way of
praise, and he probably means the Baptist’s address, Offspring of vipers, etc., to be understood
as addressed to them also. Another point is, that to the Pharisees and Sadducees he says,
“Bring forth a fruit,” in the singular, “worthy of repentance,” but to the multitudes he uses
the plural, “Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.” Perhaps the Pharisees are required to
yield the special fruit of repentance, which is no other than the Son and faith in Him, while
the multitudes, who have not even a beginning of good things, are asked for all the fruits of
repentance, and so the plural is used to them. Further, it is said to the Pharisees, “Think
not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father.” For the multitudes now
have a beginning, appearing as they do to be introduced into the divine Word, and to approach
the truth; and thus they begin to say within themselves, “We have Abraham for our
father.” The Pharisees, on the contrary, are not beginning to this, but have long held it to
be so. But both classes see John point to the stones aforesaid and declare that even from
these children can be raised up to Abraham, rising up out of unconsciousness and deadness.
And observe how it is said to the Pharisees,4900 according to the word of the prophet,4901
“Ye have eaten false fruit,” and they have false fruit,—“Every tree which bringeth not forth
good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire,” while to the multitudes which do not bear
fruit at all,4902 “Every tree which bringeth not forth fruit is hewn down.” For that which
has no fruit at all has not good fruit, and, therefore, it is worthy to be hewn down. But that
which bears fruit has by no means good fruit, whence it also calls for the axe to lay it low.
But, if we look more closely into this about the fruit, we shall find that it is impossible that
that which has just begun to be cultivated, even should it not prove fruitless, should bear
the first good fruits. The husbandman is content that the tree just coming into cultivation
should bear him at first such fruits as it may; afterwards, when he has pruned and trained
it according to his art, he will receive, not the fruits it chanced to bear at first, but good
fruits. The law itself favours this interpretation, for it says4903 that the planter is to wait for
three years, having the trees pruned and not eating the fruit of them. “Three years,” it says,
“the fruit shall be unpurified to you, and shall not be eaten, but in the fourth year all the

<pb n="693"/>
fruit shall be holy, for giving praise unto the Lord.” This explains how the word “good” is
omitted from the address to the multitudes, “Every tree, therefore, which bears not fruit is
hewn down and cast into the fire.” The tree which goes on bearing such fruit as it did at
first, is a tree which does not bear good fruit, and is, therefore, cut down, and cast into the
fire, since, when the three years have passed and the fourth comes round, it does not bear
good fruit, for praise unto the Lord. In thus adducing the passages from the other Gospels
I may appear to be digressing, but I cannot think it useless, or without bearing on our present
subject. For the Pharisees send to John, after the priests and levites who came from Jerusalem,
men who came to ask him who he was, and enquire, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be
not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet? After making this enquiry they straightway
come for baptism, as Matthew records, and then they hear words suited to their quackery
and hypocrisy. But the words addressed to them were very similar to those spoken to the
multitudes, and hence the necessity to look carefully at both speeches, and to compare them
together. It was while we were so engaged that various points arose in the sequence of the
matter, which we had to consider. To what has been said we must add the following. We
find mention made in John of two orders of persons sending: the one, that of the Jews from
Jerusalem sending priests and levites; the other, that of the Pharisees who want to know
why he baptizes. And we found that, after the enquiry, the Pharisees present themselves
for baptism. May it not be that the Jews, who had sent the earlier mission from Jerusalem,
received John’s words before those who sent the second mission, namely, the Pharisees, and
hence arrived before them? For Jerusalem and all Judæa, and, in consequence, the whole
region round about Jordan, were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their
sins; or, as Mark says, “There went out to him the whole land of Judæa, and all they of Jerusalem,
and were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.” Now, neither
does Matthew introduce the Pharisees and Sadducees, to whom the words, “Offspring of
vipers,” etc., are addressed; nor does Luke introduce the multitudes who meet with the same
rebuke, as confessing their sins. And the question may be raised how, if the whole city of
Jerusalem, and the whole of Judæa, and the whole region round about Jordan, were baptized
of John in Jordan, the Saviour could say,4904 “John the Baptist came neither eating nor
drinking, and ye say he hath a devil;” and how could He say to those who asked Him,4905
“By what authority doest thou these things? I also will ask you one word, which if ye tell
me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence
was it? from heaven or of men? And they reason, and say, If we shall say, From heaven, He
will say, Why did ye not believe him?” The solution of the difficulty is this. The Pharisees,
addressed by John, as we saw before, with his “Offspring of vipers,” etc., came to the baptism,
<note type="footnote">4904 Matt. xi. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">4905 Matt. xxi. 23.</note>

<pb n="694"/>
without believing in him, probably because they feared the multitudes, and, with their accustomed
hypocrisy towards them, deemed it right to undergo the washing, so as not to
appear hostile to those who did so. Their belief was, then, that he derived his baptism from
men, and not from heaven, but, on account of the multitude, lest they should be stoned,
they are afraid to say what they think. Thus there is no contradiction between the Saviour’s
speech to the Pharisees and the narratives in the Gospels about the multitudes who frequented
John’s baptism. It was part of the effrontery of the Pharisees that they declared John to have
a devil, as, also, that they declared Jesus to have performed His wonderful works by Beelzebub,
the prince of the devils.</p>

<head>15. How the Baptist Answers the Question of the Pharisees and Exalts the Nature
of Christ. Of the Shoe-Latchet Which He is Unable to Untie.</head>
<p>John4906 answered them, saying, “I baptize with water, but in the midst of you standeth
one whom ye know not, even He who cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not
worthy to unloose.” Heracleon considers that John’s answers to those sent by the Pharisees
refer not to what they asked, but to what he wished, not observing that he accuses the
prophet of a want of manners, by making him, when asked about one thing, answer about
another; for this is a fault to be guarded against in conversation. We assert, on the contrary,
that the reply accurately takes up the question. It is asked, “Why baptizest thou then, if thou
art not the Christ?” And what other answer could be given to this than to show that his
baptism was in its nature a bodily thing? I, he says, “baptize with water;” this is his answer
to, “Why baptizest thou.” And to the second part of their question, “If thou art not the
Christ,” he answers by exalting the superior nature of Christ, that He has such virtue as to
be invisible in His deity, though present to every man and extending over the whole universe.
This is what is indicated in the words, “There standeth one among you.” The Pharisees,
moreover, though expecting the advent of Christ, saw nothing in Him of such a nature as
John speaks of; they believed Him to be simply a perfect and holy man. John, therefore,
rebukes their ignorance of His superiority, and adds to the words, “There standeth one
among you,” the clause, “whom ye know not.” And, lest any one should suppose the invisible
One who extends to every man, or, indeed, to the whole world, to be a different person from
Him who became man, and appeared upon the earth and conversed with men, he adds to
the words, “There standeth one among you whom you know not,” the further words, “Who
cometh after me,” that is, He who is to be manifested after me. By whose surpassing excellence
he well understood that his own nature was far surpassed, though some doubted
whether he might be the Christ; and, therefore, desiring to show how far he is from attaining
to the greatness of the Christ, that no one should think of him beyond what he sees or hears
of him, he goes on: “The latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.” By which he
conveys, as in a riddle, that he is not fit to solve and to explain the argument about Christ’s
assuming a human body, an argument tied up and hidden (like a shoe-tie) to those who do
not understand it,—so as to say anything worthy of such an advent, compressed, as it was,
into so short a space.</p>

<head>16. Comparison of John’s Testimony to Jesus in the Different Gospels.</head>
<p>It may not be out of place, as we are examining the text, “I baptize with water,” to
compare the parallel utterances of the evangelists with this of John. Matthew reports that
the Baptist, when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, after
the words of rebuke which we have already studied, went on:4907 “I indeed baptize you
with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I
am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.” This agrees
with the words in John, in which the Baptist declares himself to those sent by the Pharisees,
on the subject of his baptizing with water. Mark, again, says,4908 “John preached, saying,
There cometh after me He that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy
to stoop down and unloose. I baptized you with water, but He shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost.” And Luke says4909 that, as the people were in expectation, and all were reasoning
in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ, John answered
them all, saying, “I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh one mightier than I,
whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost,
and with fire.”</p>

<head>17. Of the Testimony of John to Jesus in Matthew’s Gospel,</head>
<p>These, then, are the parallel passages of the four; let us try to see as clearly as we can
what is the purport of each and wherein they differ from each other. And we will begin
with Matthew, who is reported by tradition to have published his Gospel before the others,
to the Hebrews, those, namely, of the circumcision who believed. I, he says, baptize you
with water unto repentance, purifying you, as it were, and turning you away from evil courses
and calling you to repentance; for I am come to make ready for the Lord a people prepared
for Him, and by my baptism of repentance to prepare the ground for Him who is to come
after me, and who will thus benefit you much more effectively and powerfully than my
strength could. For His baptism is not that of the body only; He fills the penitent with the
Holy Ghost, and His diviner fire does away with everything material and consumes everything
that is earthy, not only from him who admits it to his life, but even from him who hears of
it from those who have it. So much stronger than I is He who is coming after me, that I am
not able to bear even the outskirts of the powers round Him which are furthest from Him
(they are not open and exposed, so that any one could see them), nor even to bear those
who support them. I know not of which I should speak. Should I speak of my own great
weakness, which is not able to bear even these things about Christ which in comparison
with the greater things in Him are least, or should I speak of His transcendent Deity, greater
than all the world? If I who have received such grace, as to be thought worthy of prophecy
predicting my arrival in this human life, in the words, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness,”
and “Behold I send my messenger before thy face;” if I whose birth Gabriel who
stands before God announced to my father so advanced in years, so much against his expectation,
I at whose name Zacharias recovered his voice and was enabled to use it to prophesy,
I to whom my Lord bears witness that among them that are born of women there is none
greater than I, I am not able so much as to bear His shoes! And if not His shoes, what can
be said about His garments? Who is so great as to be able to guard His coat? Who can
suppose that He can understand the meaning contained in His tunic which is without seam
from the top because it is woven throughout? It is to be observed that while the four represent
John as declaring himself to have come to baptize with water, Matthew alone adds the words
“to repentance,” teaching that the benefit of baptism is connected with the intention of the
baptized person; to him who repents it is salutary, but to him who comes to it without repentance
it will turn to greater condemnation. And here we must note that as the wonderful
works done by the Saviour in the cures He wrought, which are symbolical of those who at
any time are set free by the word of God from any sickness or disease, though they were
done to the body and brought a bodily relief, yet also called those who were benefited by
them to an exercise of faith, so the washing with water which is symbolic of the soul
cleansing herself from every stain of wickedness, is no less in itself to him who yields himself
to the divine power of the invocation of the Adorable Trinity, the beginning and source of

<pb n="698"/>
divine gifts; for “there are diversities of gifts.” This view receives confirmation from the
narrative recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, which shows the Spirit to have descended so
manifestly on those who receive baptism, after the water had prepared the way for him in
those who properly approached the rite. Simon Magus, astonished at what he saw, desired
to receive from Peter this gift, but though it was a good thing he desired, he thought to attain
it by the mammon of unrighteousness. We next remark in passing that the baptism of John
was inferior to the baptism of Jesus which was given through His disciples. Those persons
in the Acts4910 who were baptized to John’s baptism and who had not heard if there was
any Holy Ghost are baptized over again by the Apostle. Regeneration did not take place
with John, but with Jesus through His disciples it does so, and what is called the laver of
regeneration takes place with renewal of the Spirit; for the Spirit now comes in addition
since it comes from God and is over and above the water and does not come to all after the
water. So far, then, our examination of the statements in the Gospel according to Matthew.</p>

<pb n="699"/>
<head>18. Of the Testimony in Mark. What is Meant by the Saviour’s Shoes and by Untying
His Shoe-Latchets.</head>
<p>Now let us consider what is stated by Mark. Mark’s account of John’s preaching agrees
with the other. The words are, “There cometh after me He that is mightier than I,” which
amounts to the same thing as “He that cometh after me is mightier than I.” There is a difference,
however, in what follows, “The latchets of His shoes I am not worthy to stoop down
and untie.” For it is one thing to bear a person’s shoes,—they must, it is evident, have been
untied already from the feet of the wearer,—and it is another thing to stoop down and untie
the latchet of his shoes. And it follows, since believers cannot think that either of the
Evangelists made any mistake or misrepresentation, that the Baptist must have made these
two utterances at different times and have meant them to express different things. It is not
the case, as some suppose. that the reports refer to the same incident and turned out differently
because of a looseness of memory as to some of the facts or words. Now it is a great
thing to bear the shoes of Jesus, a great thing to stoop down to the bodily features of His
mission, to that which took place in some lower region, so as to contemplate His image in
the lower sphere, and to untie each difficulty connected with the mystery of His incarnation,
such being as it were His shoe-latchets. For the fetter of obscurity is one as the key of
knowledge also is one; not even He who is greatest among those born of women is sufficient
of Himself to loose such things or to open them, for He who tied and locked at first, He also
grants to whom He will to loose His shoe-latchet and to unlock what He has shut. If the
passage about the shoes has a mystic meaning we ought not to scorn to consider it. Now I
consider that the inhumanisation when the Son of God assumes flesh and bones is one of
His shoes, and that the other is the descent to Hades, whatever that Hades be, and the
journey with the Spirit to the prison. As to the descent into Hades, we read in the sixteenth
Psalm, “Thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades,” and as for the journey in prison with the
Spirit we read in Peter in his Catholic Epistle,4911 “Put to death,” he says, “in the flesh, but
quickened in the Spirit; in which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison, which
at one time were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God once waited in the days of
Noah while the ark was a preparing.” He, then, who is able worthily to set forth the meaning
of these two journeys is able to untie the latchet of the shoes of Jesus; he, bending down in
his mind and going with Jesus as He goes down into Hades, and descending from heaven
and the mysteries of Christ’s deity to the advent He of necessity made with us when He took
on man (as His shoes). Now He who put on man also put on the dead, for4912 “for this end
Jesus both died and revived, that He might be Lord both of dead and living.” This is why
He put on both living and dead, that is, the inhabitants of the earth and those of Hades, that
<note type="footnote">4911 1 Peter iii. 18–20.</note>
<note type="footnote">4912 Rom. xiv. 9.</note>

<pb n="700"/>
He might be the Lord of both dead and living. Who, then, is able to stoop down and untie
the latchet of such shoes, and having untied them not to let them drop, but by the second
faculty he has received to take them up and bear them, by bearing the meaning of them in
his memory?</p>

<p>We must not, however, omit to ask how it comes that Luke and John give the speech
without the phrase “to stoop down.” He, perhaps, who stoops down may be held to unloose
in the sense which we have stated. On the other hand, it may be that one who fixes his eyes
on the height of the exaltation of the Logos, may find the loosing of those shoes which when
one is seeking them seem to be bound, so that He also looses those shoes which are separable
from the Logos, and beholds the Logos divested of inferior things, as He is, the Son of God.</p>

<head>20. The Difference Between Not Being “Sufficient” And Not Being “Worthy.”</head>
<p>John records that the Baptist said he was not worthy, Mark that he was not sufficient,
and these two are not the same. One who was not worthy might yet be sufficient, and one
who was worthy might not be sufficient. For even if it be the case that gifts are bestowed to
profit withal and not merely according to the proportion of faith, yet it would seem to be
the part of a God who loves men and who sees before what harm must come from the rise
of self-opinion or conceit, not to bestow sufficiency even on the worthy. But it belongs to
the goodness of God by conferring bounties to conquer the object of His bounty, taking in
advance him who is destined to be worthy, and adorning him even before he becomes worthy
with sufficiency, so that after his sufficiency he may come to be worthy; he is not first to be
worthy and then to anticipate the giver and take His gifts before the time and so arrive at
being sufficient. Now with the three the Baptist says he is not sufficient, while in John he
says he is not worthy. But it may be that he who formerly declared that he was not sufficient
became sufficient afterwards, even though perhaps he was not worthy, or again that while
he was saying he was not worthy, and was in fact not worthy, he arrived at being worthy,
unless one should say that human nature can never come to perform worthily this loosing
or this bearing, and that John, therefore, says truly that he never became sufficient to loose
the latchets of the Saviour’s shoes, nor worthy of it either. However much we take into our
minds there are still left things not yet understood; for, as we read in the wisdom of Jesus,
son of Sirach,4913 “When a man hath done, then he beginneth, and when he leaveth off,
then he shall be doubtful.”</p>

<head>21. The Fourth Gospel Speaks of Only One Shoe, the Others of Both. The Significance
of This.</head>
<p>As to the shoes, too, which are spoken of in the three Gospels, we have a question to
consider; we must compare them with the single shoe named by the disciple John. “I am
not worthy,” we read there, “to untie the latchet of His shoe.” Perhaps he was conquered
by the grace of God, and received the gift of doing that which of himself he would not have
been worthy to do, of untying, namely, the latchet of one of the shoes, namely, after he had
seen the Saviour’s sojourn among men, of which he bears witness. But he did not know the
things which were to follow, namely, whether Jesus was to come to that place also, to which
he was to go after being beheaded in prison, or whether he was to look for another; and
hence he alludes enigmatically to that doubt which was afterwards cleared up to us, and
says, “I am not worthy to untie His shoe-latchet.” If any one considers this to be a superfluous
speculation, he can combine in one the speech about the shoes and that about the shoe, as
if John said, I am by no means worthy to loose His shoestring, not even at the beginning,
the string of one of His shoes. Or the following may be a way to combine what is said in
the Four. If John understands about Jesus’ sojourn here, but is in doubt about the future,
then he says with perfect truth that he is not worthy to loose the latchet of His shoes; for
though he loosed that of one shoe, he did not loose both. And on the other hand, what he
says about the latchet of the shoe is quite true also; since as we saw he is still in doubt
whether Jesus is He that was to come, or whether another is to be looked for, in that other
region.</p>

<head>22. How the Word Stands in the Midst of Men Without Being Known of Them.</head>
<p>As for the saying, “There standeth one among you whom you know not,” we are led by
it to consider the Son of God, the Word, by whom all things were made, since He exists in
substance throughout the underlying nature of things, being the same as wisdom. For He
permeated, from the beginning, all creation, so that what is made at any time should be
made through Him, and that it might be always true of anything soever, that “All things
were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made;” and this
saying also, “By wisdom didst thou make them all.” Now, if He permeates all creation, then
He is also in those questioners who ask, “Why baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, nor
Elijah, nor the prophet?” In the midst of them stands the Word, who is the same and
steadfast, being everywhere established by the Father. Or the words, “There standeth among
you,” may be understood to say, In the midst of you men, because you are reasonable beings,
stands He who is proved by Scripture to be the sovereign principle in the midst of every
body, and so to be present in your heart. Those, therefore, who have the Word in the midst
of them, but who do not consider His nature, nor from what spring and principle He came,
nor how He gave them the nature they have,4914 these, while having Him in the midst of
them, know Him not. But John knew Him: for the words, “Whom you know not,” used
in reproach to the Pharisees, show that he well knew the Word whom they did not know.
And the Baptist, therefore, knowing Him, saw Him coming after himself, who was now in
the midst of them, that is to say, dwelling after him and the teaching he gave in his baptism,
in those who, according to reason (or the Word), submitted to that purifying rite. The word
“after,” however, has not the same meaning here as it has when Jesus commands us to come
“after” Him; for in this case we are bidden to go after Him, so that, treading in His steps,
we may come to the Father; but in the other case, the meaning is that after the teachings of
John (since “He came in order that all men through Him might believe”), the Word dwells
with those who have prepared themselves, purified as they are by the lesser words for the
perfect Word. Firstly, then, stands the Father, being without any turning or change; and
then stands also His Word, always carrying on His work of salvation, and even when He is
in the midst of men, not comprehended, and not even seen. He stands, also, teaching, and
inviting all to drink from His abundant spring, for4915 “Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any
man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.”</p>

<head>23. Heracleon’s View of This Utterance of John the Baptist, and Interpretation of
the Shoe of Jesus.</head>
<p>But Heracleon declares the words, “There standeth one among you,” to be equivalent
to “He is already here, and He is in the world and in men, and He is already manifest to you
all.” By this He does away with the meaning which is also present in the words, that the
Word had permeated the whole world. For we must say to him, When is He not present,
and when is He not in the world? Does not this Gospel say, “He was in the world, and the
world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.” And this is why those to whom
the Logos is He “whom you know not,” do not know Him: they have never gone out of the
world, but the world does not know Him. But at what time did He cease to be among men?
Was He not in Isaiah, when He said,4916 “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He
hath anointed me,” and4917 “I became manifest to those who sought me not.” Let them say,
too, if He was not in David when he said, not from himself,4918 “But I was established by
Him a king in Zion His holy hill,” and the other words spoken in the Psalms in the person
of Christ. And why should I go over the details of this proof, truly they are hard to be
numbered, when I can show quite clearly that He was always in men? And that is enough
to show Heracleon’s interpretation of “There standeth in the midst of you,” to be unsound,
when he says it is equivalent to “He is already here, and He is in the world and in men.”
We are disposed to agree with him when he says that the words, “Who cometh after me,”
show John to be the forerunner of Christ, for he is in fact a kind of servant running before
his master. The words, however, “Whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose,” receive
much too simple an interpretation when it is said that “in these words the Baptist confesses
that he is not worthy even of the least honourable ministration to Christ.” After this interpretation
he adds, not without sense, “I am not worthy that for my sake He should come
down from His greatness and should take flesh as His footgear, concerning which I am not
able to give any explanation or description, nor to unloose the arrangement of it.” In understanding
the world by his shoe, Heracleon shows some largeness of mind, but immediately
after he verges on impiety in declaring that all this is to be understood of that person whom
John here has in his mind. For he considers that it is the demiurge of the world who confesses
by these words that he is a lesser person than the Christ; and this is the height of impiety.
For the Father who sent Him, He who is the God of the living as Jesus Himself testifies, of
Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, and He who is greater than heaven and earth for the
reason that He is the Maker of them, He also alone is good and is greater than He who was
sent by Him. And even if, as we said, Heracleon’s idea was a lofty one, that the whole world

<pb n="706"/>
was the shoe of Jesus, yet I think we ought not to agree with him. For how can it be harmonized
with such a view, that “Heaven is My throne and the earth My footstool,” a testimony
which Jesus accepts as said of the Father?4919 “Swear not by heaven,” He says, “for it is
God’s throne, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet.” How, if he takes the whole
world to be the shoe of Jesus, can he also accept the text,4920 “Do not I fill heaven and earth?”
saith the Lord. It is also worth while to enquire, whether as the Word and wisdom permeated
the whole world, and as the Father was in the Son, the words are to be understood as above
or in this way, that He who first of all was girded about with the whole creation, in addition
to the Son’s being in Him, granted to the Saviour, as being second after Him and being God
the Word, to pervade the whole creation. To those who have it in them to take note of the
uninterrupted movement of the great heaven, how it carries with it from East to West so
great a multitude of stars, to them most of all it will seem needful to enquire what that force
is, how great and of what nature, which is present in the whole world. For to pronounce
that force to be other than the Father and the Son, that perhaps might be inconsistent with
piety.</p>

<head>24. The Name of the Place Where John Baptized is Not Bethany, as in Most Copies,
But Bethabara. Proof of This. Similarly “Gergesa” Should Be Read for “Gerasa,”
In the Story of the Swine. Attention is to Be Paid to the Proper Names in Scripture,
Which are Often Written Inaccurately, and are of Importance for Interpretation.</head>
<p>“These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.”4921
We are aware of the reading which is found in almost all the copies, “These things were
done in Bethany.” This appears, moreover, to have been the reading at an earlier time; and
in Heracleon we read “Bethany.” We are convinced, however, that we should not read
“Bethany,” but “Bethabara.” We have visited the places to enquire as to the footsteps of Jesus
and His disciples, and of the prophets. Now, Bethany, as the same evangelist tells us,4922
was the town of Lazarus, and of Martha and Mary; it is fifteen stadia from Jerusalem, and
the river Jordan is about a hundred and eighty stadia distant from it. Nor is there any other
place of the same name in the neighbourhood of the Jordan, but they say that Bethabara is
pointed out on the banks of the Jordan, and that John is said to have baptized there. The
etymology of the name, too, corresponds with the baptism of him who made ready for the
Lord a people prepared for Him; for it yields the meaning “House of preparation,” while
Bethany means “House of obedience.” Where else was it fitting that he should baptize, who
was sent as a messenger before the face of the Christ, to prepare His way before Him, but
at the House of preparation? And what more fitting home for Mary, who chose the good
part,4923 which was not taken away from her, and for Martha, who was cumbered for the
reception of Jesus, and for their brother, who is called the friend of the Saviour, than Bethany,
the House of obedience? Thus we see that he who aims at a complete understanding of the
Holy Scriptures must not neglect the careful examination of the proper names in it. In the
matter of proper names the Greek copies are often incorrect, and in the Gospels one might
be misled by their authority. The transaction about the swine, which were driven down a
steep place by the demons and drowned in the sea, is said to have taken place in the country
of the Gerasenes.4924 Now, Gerasa is a town of Arabia, and has near it neither sea nor lake.
And the Evangelists would not have made a statement so obviously and demonstrably false;
for they were men who informed themselves carefully of all matters connected with Judæa.
But in a few copies we have found, “into the country of the Gadarenes;” and, on this reading,
it is to be stated that Gadara is a town of Judæa, in the neighbourhood of which are the well-

known hot springs, and that there is no lake there with overhanging banks, nor any sea.
But Gergesa, from which the name Gergesenes is taken, is an old town in the neighbourhood
of the lake now called Tiberias, and on the edge of it there is a steep place abutting on the
lake, from which it is pointed out that the swine were cast down by the demons. Now, the
meaning of Gergesa is “dwelling of the casters-out,” and it contains a prophetic reference
to the conduct towards the Saviour of the citizens of those places, who “besought Him to
depart out of their coasts.” The same inaccuracy with regard to proper names is also to be
observed in many passages of the law and the prophets, as we have been at pains to learn
from the Hebrews, comparing our own copies with theirs which have the confirmation of
the versions, never subjected to corruption, of Aquila and Theodotion and Symmachus.
We add a few instances to encourage students to pay more attention to such points. One
of the sons of Levi,4925 the first, is called Geson in most copies, instead of Gerson. His name
is the same as that of the first-born of Moses;4926 it was given appropriately in each case,
both children being born, because of the sojourn in Egypt, in a strange land. The second
son of Juda,4927 again, has with us the name Annan, but with the Hebrews Onan, “their labour.”
Once more, in the departures of the children of Israel in Numbers,4928 we find,
“They departed from Sochoth and pitched in Buthan;” but the Hebrew, instead of Buthan,
reads Aiman. And why should I add more points like these, when any one who desires it
can examine into the proper names and find out for himself how they stand? The placenames
of Scripture are specially to be suspected where many of them occur in a catalogue,
as in the account of the partition of the country in Joshua, and in the first Book of Chronicles
from the beginning down to, say, the passage about Dan,4929 and similarly in Ezra. Names
are not to be neglected, since indications may be gathered from them which help in the interpretation
of the passages where they occur. We cannot, however, leave our proper subject
to examine in this place into the philosophy of names.</p>

<head>25. Jordan Means “Their Going Down.” Spiritual Meanings and Application of
This.</head>
<p>Let us look at the words of the Gospel now before us. “Jordan” means “their going
down.” The name “Jared” is etymologically akin to it, if I may say so; it also yields the
meaning “going down;” for Jared was born to Maleleel, as it is written in the Book of
Enoch—if any one cares to accept that book as sacred—in the days when the sons of God
came down to the daughters of men. Under this descent some have supposed that there is
an enigmatical reference to the descent of souls into bodies, taking the phrase “daughters
of men” as a tropical expression for this earthly tabernacle. Should this be so, what river
will “their going down” be, to which one must come to be purified, a river going down, not
with its own descent, but “theirs,” that, namely, of men, what but our Saviour who separates
those who received their lots from Moses from those who obtained their own portions
through Jesus (Joshua)? His current, flowing in the descending stream, makes glad, as we
find in the Psalms,4930 the city of God, not the visible Jerusalem—for it has no river beside
it—but the blameless Church of God, built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,
Christ Jesus our Lord being the chief corner-stone. Under the Jordan, accordingly, we have
to understand the Word of God who became flesh and tabernacled among us, Jesus who
gives us as our inheritance the humanity which He assumed, for that is the head cornerstone,
which being taken up into the deity of the Son of God, is washed by being so assumed,
and then receives into itself the pure and guileless dove of the Spirit, bound to it and no
longer able to fly away from it. For “Upon whomsoever,” we read, “thou shalt see the Spirit
descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.”
Hence, he who receives the Spirit abiding on Jesus Himself is able to baptize those who come
to him in that abiding Spirit. But John baptizes beyond Jordan, in the regions verging on
the outside of Judæa, in Bethabara, being the forerunner of Him who came to call not the
righteous but sinners, and who taught that the whole have no need of a physician, but they
that are sick. For it is for forgiveness of sins that this washing is given.</p>

<head>26. The Story of Israel Crossing Jordan Under Joshua is Typical of Christian Things,
and is Written for Our Instruction.</head>
<p>Now, it may very well be that some one not versed in the various aspects of the Saviour
may stumble at the interpretation given above of the Jordan; because John says, “I baptize
with water, but He that cometh after me is stronger than I; He shall baptize you with the
Holy Spirit.” To this we reply that, as the Word of God in His character as something to be
drunk is to one set of men water, and to another wine, making glad the heart of man, and
to others blood, since it is said,4931 “Except ye drink My blood, ye have no life in you,” and
as in His character as food He is variously conceived as living bread or as flesh, so also He,
the same person, is baptism of water, and baptism of Holy Spirit and of fire, and to some,
also, of blood. It is of His last baptism, as some hold, that He speaks in the words,4932 “I
have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished?” And
it agrees with this that the disciple John speaks in his Epistle4933 of the Spirit, and the water,
and the blood, as being one. And again He declares Himself to be the way and the door,
but clearly He is not the door to those to whom He is the way, and He is no longer the way
to those to whom He is the door. All those, then, who are being initiated in the beginning
of the oracles of God, and come to the voice of him who cries in the wilderness, “Make
straight the way of the Lord,” the voice which sounds beyond Jordan at the house of preparation,
let them prepare themselves so that they may be in a state to receive the spiritual word,
brought home to them by the enlightenment of the Spirit. As we are now, as our subject
requires, bringing together all that relates to the Jordan, let us look at the “river.” God, by
Moses, carried the people through the Red Sea, making the water a wall for them on the
right hand and on the left, and by Joshua He carried them through Jordan. Now, Paul deals
with this Scripture, and his warfare is not according to the flesh of it, for he knew that the
law is spiritual in a spiritual sense. And he shows us that he understood what is said about
the passage of the Red Sea; for he says in his first Epistle to the Corinthians,4934 “I would
not, brethren, have you ignorant, how that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all
passed through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and
did all eat the same spiritual meat, and drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the
spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.” In the spirit of this passage
let us also pray that we may receive from God to understand the spiritual meaning of Joshua’s
passage through Jordan. Of it, also, Paul would have said, “I would not, brethren, have you
ignorant, that all our fathers went through Jordan, and were all baptized into Jesus in the

<pb n="711"/>
spirit and in the river.” And Joshua, who succeeded Moses, was a type of Jesus Christ, who
succeeds the dispensation through the law, and replaces it by the preaching of the Gospel.
And even if those Paul speaks of were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, there is something
harsh and salt in their baptism. They are still in fear of their enemies, and crying to the Lord
and to Moses, saying,4935 “Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou brought us
forth to slay us in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out
of Egypt?” But the baptism to Joshua, which takes place in quite sweet and drinkable water,
is in many ways superior to that earlier one, religion having by this time grown clearer and
assuming a becoming order. For the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God is carried in
procession by the priests and levites, the people following the ministers of God, it, also, accepting
the law of holiness. For Joshua says to the people,4936 “Sanctify yourselves against
tomorrow; the Lord will do wonders among you.” And he commands the priests to go before
the people with the ark of the covenant, wherein is plainly showed forth the mystery of the
Father’s economy about the Son, which is highly exalted by Him who gave the Son this office;
“That at the name of Jesus4937 every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on
earth and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” This is pointed out by what we find in the book called
Joshua,4938 “In that day I will begin to exalt thee before the children of Israel.” And we hear
our Lord Jesus saying to the children of Israel,4939 “Come hither and hear the words of the
Lord your God. Hereby ye shall know that the living God is in (among) you;” for when we
are baptized to Jesus, we know that the living God is in us. And, in the former case, they
kept the passover in Egypt, and then began their journey, but with Joshua, after crossing
Jordan on the tenth day of the first month they pitched their camp in Galgala; for a sheep
had to be procured before invitations could be issued to the banquet after Joshua’s baptism.
Then the children of Israel, since the children of those who came out of Egypt had not received
circumcision, were circumcised by Joshua with a very sharp stone; the Lord declares
that He takes away the reproach of Egypt on the day of Joshua’s baptism, when Joshua
purified the children of Israel. For it is written:4940 “And the Lord said to Joshua, the son
of Nun, This day have I taken away the reproach of Egypt from off you.” Then the children
of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, with much greater gladness
than in Egypt, for they ate unleavened bread of the corn of the holy land, and fresh food

better than manna. For when they received the land of promise God did not entertain them
with scantier food, nor when such a one as Joshua was their leader do they get inferior bread.
This will be plain to him who thinks of the true holy land and of the Jerusalem above. Hence
it is written in this same Gospel:4941 Your fathers did eat bread in the wilderness, and are
dead; he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. For the manna, though it was given by
God, yet was bread of travel, bread supplied to those still under discipline, well fitted for
those who were under tutors and governors. And the new bread Joshua managed to get
from corn they cut in the country, in the land of promise, others having laboured and his
disciples reaping,—that was bread more full of life, distributed as it was to those who, for
their perfection, were able to receive the inheritance of their fathers. Hence, he who is still
under discipline to that bread may receive death as far as it is concerned, but he who has
attained to the bread that follows that, eating it, shall live for ever. All this has been added,
not, I conceive, without appropriateness, to our study of the baptism at the Jordan, administered
by John at Bethabara.</p>

<head>27. Of Elijah and Elisha Crossing the Jordan.</head>
<p>Another point which we must not fail to notice is that when Elijah was about to be taken
up in a whirlwind, as if to heaven,4942 he took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote
the water, which was divided hither and thither, and they went over both of them, that is,
he and Elisha. His baptism in the Jordan made him fitter to be taken up, for, as we showed
before, Paul gives the name of baptism to such a remarkable passage through the water.
And through this same Jordan Elisha receives, through Elijah, the gift he desired, saying,
“Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.” What enabled him to receive this gift of
the spirit of Elijah was, perhaps, that he had passed through Jordan twice, once with Elijah,
and the second time, when, after receiving the mantle of Elijah, he smote the water and said,
“Where is the God of Elijah, even He? And he smote the waters, and they were divided
hither and thither.”</p>

<head>28. Naaman the Syrian and the Jordan. No Other Stream Has the Same Healing
Power.</head>
<p>Should any one object to the expression “He smote the water,” on account of the conclusion
we arrived at above with respect to the Jordan, that it is a type of the Word who
descended for us our descending, we rejoin that with the Apostle the rock is plainly said to
be Christ, and that it is smitten twice with the rod, so that the people may drink of the
spiritual rock which follows them. The “smiting” in this new difficulty is that of those who
are fond of suggesting something that contradicts the conclusion even before they have
learned what the question is which is in hand. From such God sets us free, since, on the
one hand, He gives us to drink when we are thirsty, and on the other He prepares for us, in
the immense and trackless deep, a road to pass over, namely, by the dividing of His Word,
since it is by the reason which distinguishes (divides) that most things are made plain to
us. But that we may receive the right interpretation about this Jordan, so good to drink, so
full of grace, it may be of use to compare the cleansing of Naaman the Syrian from his leprosy,
and what is said of the rivers of religion of the enemies of Israel. It is recorded of Naaman4943
that he came with horse and chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. And
Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go, wash seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh
shall come again unto thee, and thou shalt be cleansed.” Then Naaman is angry; he does
not see that our Jordan is the cleanser of those who are impure from leprosy, from that impurity,
and their restorer to health; it is the Jordan that does this, and not the prophet; the
office of the prophet is to direct to the healing agency. Naaman then says, not understanding
the great mystery of the Jordan, “Behold, I said that he will certainly come out to me, and
will call upon the name of the Lord his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and restore
the leper.” For to put his hand on the leprosy4944 and cleanse it is a work belonging to our
Lord Jesus only; for when the leper appealed to Him with faith, saying, “If Thou wilt Thou
canst make me clean,” He not only said, “I will, be thou clean,” but in addition to the word
He touched him, and he was cleansed from his leprosy. Naaman, then, is still in error, and
does not see how far inferior other rivers are to the Jordan for the cure of the suffering; he
extols the rivers of Damascus, Arbana, and Pharpha, saying, “Are not Arbana and Pharpha,
rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Shall I not wash in them and be
clean?” For as none is good4945 but one, God the Father, so among rivers none is good but
the Jordan, nor able to cleanse from his leprosy him who with faith washes his soul in Jesus.
And this, I suppose, is the reason why the Israelites are recorded to have wept when they
sat by the rivers of Babylon and remembered Zion; those who are carried captive, on account

of their wickedness, when they taste other waters after sacred Jordan, are led to remember
with longing their own river of salvation. Therefore it is said of the rivers of Babylon, “There
we sat down,” clearly because they were unable to stand, “and wept.” And Jeremiah rebukes
those who wish to drink the waters of Egypt, and desert the water which comes down from
heaven, and is named from its so coming down—namely, the Jordan. He says,4946 “What
hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Geon, and to drink the water
of the river,” or, as it is in the Hebrew, “to drink the water of Sion.” Of which water we have

<head>29. The River of Egypt and Its Dragon, Contrasted with the Jordan.</head>
<p>But that the Spirit in the inspired Scriptures is not speaking mainly of rivers to be seen
with the eyes, may be gathered from Ezekiel’s prophecies against Pharaoh, king of Egypt:4947
“Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon, seated in the midst of
rivers, who sayest, Mine are the rivers, and I made them. And I will put traps in thy jaws,
and I will make the fishes of the river to stick to thy fins, and I will bring thee up from the
midst of thy river, and all the fish of the river, and I will cast thee down quickly and all the
fish of the river; thou shalt fall upon the face of thy land, and thou shalt not be gathered together,
and thou shalt not be adorned.” For what real bodily dragon has ever been reported
as having been seen in the material river of Egypt? But consider if the river of Egypt be not
the dwelling of the dragon who is our enemy, who was not even able to kill the child Moses.
But as the dragon is in the river of Egypt, so is God in the river which makes glad the city
of God; for the Father is in the Son. Hence those who come to wash themselves in Him put
away the reproach of Egypt, and become more fit to be restored. They are cleansed from
that foulest leprosy, receive a double portion of spiritual gifts, and are made ready to receive
the Holy Spirit, since the spiritual dove does not light on any other stream. Thus we have
considered in a way more worthy of the sacred subject the Jordan and the purification that
is in it, and Jesus being washed in it, and the house of preparation. Let us, then, draw from
the river as much help as we require.</p>

<head>30. Of What John Learned from Jesus When Mary Visited Elisabeth in the Hill
Country.</head>
<p>“The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him.”4948 The mother of Jesus had formerly,
as soon as she conceived, stayed with the mother of John, also at that time with child, and
the Former then communicated to the Formed with some exactness His own image, and
caused him to be conformed to His glory. And from this outward similarity it came that
with those who did not distinguish between the image itself and that which was according
to the image, John was thought to be Christ4949 and Jesus was supposed4950 to be John risen
from the dead. So now Jesus, after the testimonies of John to Him which we have examined,
is Himself seen by the Baptist coming to him. It is to be noticed that on the former occasion,
when the voice of Mary’s salutation came to the ears of Elisabeth, the babe John leaped in
the womb of his mother, who then received the Holy Spirit, as it were, from the ground.
For it came to pass, we read,4951 “when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe
leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she lifted up her voice
with a loud cry and said,” etc. On this occasion, similarly, John sees Jesus coming to him
and says, “Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.” For with regard
to matters of great moment one is first instructed by hearing and afterwards one sees them
with one’s own eyes. That John was helped to the shape he was to wear by the Lord who,
still in the process of formation and in His mother’s womb, approached Elisabeth, will be
clear to any one who has grasped our proof that John is a voice but that Jesus is the Word,
for when Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit at the salutation of Mary there was a great
voice in her, as the words themselves bear; for they say, “And she spake out with a loud
voice.” Elisabeth, it is plain, did this, “and she spake.” For the voice of Mary’s salutation
coming to the ears of Elisabeth filled John with itself; hence John leaps, and his mother becomes,
as it were, the mouth of her son and a prophetess, crying out with a loud voice and
saying, “Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.” Now we see
clearly how it was with Mary’s hasty journey to the hill country, and her entrance into the
house of Zacharias, and the greeting with which she salutes Elisabeth; it was that she might
communicate some of the power she derived from Him she had conceived, to John, yet in
his mother’s womb, and that John too might communicate to his mother some of the
prophetic grace which had come to him, that all these things were done. And most rightly
was it in the hill country that these transactions took place, since no great thing can be entertained
by those who are low and may be thence called valleys. Here, then, after the

testimonies of John,—the first, when he cried and spoke about His deity; the second, addressed
to the priests and levites who were sent by the Jews from Jerusalem; and the third,
in answer to the sharper questions of those from the Pharisees,—Jesus is seen by the witnessbearer
coming to him while he is still advancing and growing better. This advance and
improvement is symbolically indicated in the phrase, “On the morrow.” For Jesus came in
the consequent illumination, as it were, and on the day after what had preceded, not only
known as standing in the midst even of those who knew Him not, but now plainly seen advancing
to him who had formerly made such declarations about Him. On the first day the
testimonies take place, and on the second Jesus comes to John. On the third John, standing
with two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as He walked, said, “Behold the Lamb of
God,” thus urging those who were there to follow the Son of God. On the fourth day, too,
He was minded to go forth into Galilee, and He who came forth to seek that which was lost
finds Philip and says to him, “Follow Me.” And on that day, after the fourth, which is the
sixth from the beginning of those we have enumerated, the marriage takes place in Cana of
Galilee, which we shall have to consider when we get to the passage. Note this, too, that
Mary being the greater comes to Elisabeth, who is the less, and the Son of God comes to the
Baptist; which should encourage us to render help without delay to those who are in a lower
position, and to cultivate for ourselves a moderate station.</p>

<head>31. Of the Conversation Between John and Jesus at the Baptism, Recorded by Matthew
Only.</head>
<p>John the disciple does not tell us where the Saviour comes from to John the Baptist, but
we learn this from Matthew, who writes:4952 “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan
to John, to be baptized of him.” And Mark adds the place in Galilee; he says,4953 “And it
came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by
John in Jordan.” Luke does not mention the place Jesus came from, but on the other hand
he tells us what we do not learn from the others, that immediately after the baptism, as He
was coming up, heaven was opened to Him, and the Holy Spirit descended on Him in
bodily form like a dove. Again, it is Matthew alone who tells us of John’s preventing the
Lord, saying to the Saviour, “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?”
None of the others added this after Matthew, so that they might not be saying just the same
as he. And what the Lord rejoined, “Suffer it now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all
righteousness,” this also Matthew alone recorded.</p>

<head>32. John Calls Jesus a “Lamb.” Why Does He Name This Animal Specially? Of the
Typology of the Sacrifices, Generally.</head>
<p>“And he sayeth, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”4954
There were five animals which were brought to the altar, three that walk and two that fly;
and it seems to be worth asking why John calls the Saviour a lamb and not any of these
other creatures, and why, when each of the animals that walk is offered of three kinds he
used for the sheep-kind the term “lamb.” The five animals are as follows: the bullock, the
sheep, the goat, the turtle-dove, the pigeon. And of the walking animals these are the three
kinds—bullock, ox, calf; ram, sheep, lamb; he-goat, goat, kid. Of the flying animals, of pigeons
we only hear of two young ones; of turtle doves only of a pair. He, then, who would accurately
understand the spiritual rationale of the sacrifices must enquire of what heavenly things
these were the pattern and the shadow, and also for what end the sacrifice of each victim is
prescribed, and he must specially collect the points connected with the lamb. Now that the
principle of the sacrifice must be apprehended with reference to certain heavenly mysteries,
appears from the words of the Apostle, who somewhere4955 says, “Who serve a pattern and
shadow of heavenly things,” and again, “It was necessary that the patterns of the things in
the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better
sacrifices than these.” Now to find out all the particulars of these and to state in its relation
to them that sacrifice of the spiritual law which took place in Jesus Christ (a truth greater
than human nature can comprehend)—to do this belongs to no other than the perfect
man,4956 who, by reason of use, has his senses exercised to discern good and evil, and who
is able to say, from a truth-loving disposition,4957 “We speak wisdom among them that are
perfect.” Of these things truly and things like these, we can say,4958 “Which none of the
rulers of this world knew.”</p>

<head>33. A Lamb Was Offered at the Morning and Evening Sacrifice. Significance of
This.</head>
<p>Now we find the lamb offered in the continual (daily) sacrifice. Thus it is written,4959
“This is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day
continually, for a continual sacrifice. The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning, and
the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with beaten
oil, the fourth part of a hin; and for a drink-offering the fourth part of a bin of wine to the
first lamb. And the other lamb thou shalt offer in the evening, according to the first sacrifice
and according to its drink-offering. Thou shalt offer a sweet savour, an offering to the Lord,
a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of tent of witness before
the Lord, where I will make myself known to thee, to speak unto thee. And I will appoint
thee for the children of Israel, and I will be sanctified in my glory, and with sanctification I
will sanctify the tent of witness.” But what other continual sacrifice can there be to the man
of reason in the world of mind, but the Word growing to maturity, the Word who is symbolically
called a lamb and who is offered as soon as the soul receives illumination. This
would be the continual sacrifice of the morning, and it is offered again when the sojourn of
the mind with divine things comes to an end. For it cannot maintain for ever its intercourse
with higher things, seeing that the soul is appointed to be yoked together with the body
which is of earth and heavy.</p>

<head>34. The Morning and Evening Sacrifices of the Saint in His Life of Thought.</head>
<p>But if any one asks what the saint is to do in the time between morning and evening,
let him follow what takes place in the cultus and infer from it the principle he asks for. In
that case the priests begin their offerings with the continual sacrifice, and before they come
to the continuous one of the evening they offer the other sacrifices which the law prescribes,
as, for example, that for transgression, or that for involuntary offences, or that connected
with a prayer for salvation, or that of jealousy, or that of the Sabbath, or of the new moon,
and so on, which it would take too long to mention. So we, beginning our oblation with
the discourse of that type which is Christ, can go on to discourse about many other most
useful things. And drawing to a close still in the things of Christ, we come, as it were, to
evening and night, when we arrive at the bodily features of His manifestation.</p>

<p>If we enquire further into the significance of Jesus being pointed out by John, when he
says, “This is the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world,” we may take our
stand at the dispensation of the bodily advent of the Son of God in human life, and in that
case we shall conceive the lamb to be no other than the man. For the man “was led like a
sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb, dumb before his shearers,”4960 saying, “I was as like
a gentle lamb led to the slaughter.”4961 Hence, too, in the Apocalypse4962 a lamb is seen,
standing as if slain. This slain lamb has been made, according to certain hidden reasons, a
purification of the whole world, for which, according to the Father’s love to man, He submitted
to death, purchasing us back by His own blood from him who had got us into his
power, sold under sin. And He who led this lamb to the slaughter was God in man, the
great High-Priest, as he shows by the words:4963 “No one taketh My life away from Me, but
I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.”</p>

<head>36. Of the Death of the Martyrs Considered as a Sacrifice, and in What Way It Operates
to the Benefit of Others.</head>
<p>Akin to this sacrifice are the others of which the sacrifices of the law are symbols, and
another kind of sacrifice also appears to me to be of the same nature; namely, the shedding
of the blood of the noble martyrs, whom the disciple John saw, for this is not without significance,
standing beside the heavenly altar. “Who is wise,4964 and he shall understand these
things, prudent, and he shall know them?” It is a matter of higher speculation to consider
even slightly the rationale of those sacrifices which cleanse those for whom they are offered.
Jephthah’s sacrifice of his daughter should receive attention; it was by vowing it that he
conquered the children of Ammon, and the victim approved his vow, for when her father
said,4965 “I have opened my mouth unto the Lord against thee,” she answered, “If thou hast
opened thy mouth unto the Lord against me, do that which thou hast vowed.” The story
suggests that the being must be a very cruel one to whom such sacrifices are offered for the
salvation of men; and we require some breadth of mind and some ability to solve the difficulties
raised against Providence, to be able to account for such things and to see that they
are mysteries and exceed our human nature. Then we shall say,4966 “Great are the judgments
of God, and hard to be described; for this cause untutored souls have gone astray.” Among
the Gentiles, too, it is recorded that many a one, when pestilential disease broke out in his
country, offered himself a victim for the public good. That this was the case the faithful
Clement assumes,4967 on the faith of the narratives, to whom Paul bears witness when he
says,4968 “With Clement also, and the others, my fellow-labourers, whose names are in the
book of life.” If there is anything in these narratives that appears incongruous to one who
is minded to carp at mysteries revealed to few, the same difficulty attaches to the office that
was laid on the martyrs, for it was God’s will that we should rather endure all the dreadful
reproaches connected with confessing Him as God, than escape for a short time from such
sufferings (which men count evil) by allowing ourselves by our words to conform to the
will of the enemies of the truth. We are, therefore, led to believe that the powers of evil do
suffer defeat by the death of the holy martyrs; as if their patience, their confession, even
unto death, and their zeal for piety blunted the edge of the onset of evil powers against the
sufferer, and their might being thus dulled and exhausted, many others of those whom they
had conquered raised their heads and were set free from the weight with which the evil
powers formerly oppressed and injured them. And even the martyrs themselves are no

longer involved in suffering, even though those agents which formerly wrought ill to others
are not exhausted; for he who has offered such a sacrifice overcomes the power which opposed
him, as I may show by an illustration which is suited to this subject. He who destroys
a poisonous animal, or lulls it to sleep with charms, or by any means deprives it of its venom,
he does good to many who would otherwise have suffered from that animal had it not been
destroyed, or charmed, or emptied of its venom. Moreover, if one of those who were formerly
bitten should come to know of this, and should be cured of his malady and look upon the
death of that which injured him, or tread on it, or touch it when dead, or taste a part of it,
then he, who was formerly a sufferer, would owe cure and benefit to the destroyer of the
poisonous animal. In some such way must we suppose the death of the most holy martyrs
to operate, many receiving benefit from it by an influence we cannot describe.</p>

<head>37. Of the Effects of the Death of Christ, of His Triumph After It, and of the Removal
by His Death of the Sins of Men.</head>
<p>We have lingered over this subject of the martyrs and over the record of those who died
on account of pestilence, because this lets us see the excellence of Him who was led as a
sheep to the slaughter and was dumb as a lamb before the shearer. For if there is any point
in these stories of the Greeks, and if what we have said of the martyrs is well founded,—the
Apostles, too, were for the same reason the filth of the world and the offscouring of all
things,4969—what and how great things must be said of the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed
for this very reason, that He might take away the sin not of a few but of the whole world,
for the sake of which also He suffered? If any one sin, we read,4970 “We have an advocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not
for ours only, but for those of the whole world,” since He is the Saviour of all men,4971 especially
of them that believe, who4972 blotted out the written bond that was against us by His
own blood, and took it out of the way, so that not even a trace, not even of our blotted-out
sins, might still be found, and nailed it to His cross; who having put off from Himself the
principalities and powers, made a show of them openly, triumphing over them by His cross.
And we are taught to rejoice when we suffer afflictions in the world, knowing the ground
of our rejoicing to be this, that the world has been conquered and has manifestly been subjected
to its conqueror. Hence all the nations, released from their former rulers, serve Him,
because He4973 saved the poor from his tyrant by His own passion, and the needy who had
no helper. This Saviour, then, having humbled the calumniator by humbling Himself, abides
with the visible sun before His illustrious church, tropically called the moon, from generation
to generation. And having by His passion destroyed His enemies, He who is strong in battle
and a mighty Lord4974 required after His mighty deeds a purification which could only be
given Him by His Father alone; and this is why He forbids Mary to touch Him, saying,4975
“Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father; but go and tell My disciples, I go
to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.” And when He comes, loaded
with victory and with trophies, with His body which has risen from the dead,—for what
other meaning can we see in the words, “I am not yet ascended to My Father,” and “I go

unto My Father,”—then there are certain powers which say, Who is this that cometh from
Edom, red garments from Bosor; this that is beautiful?4976 Then those who escort Him say
to those that are upon the heavenly gates,4977 “Lift up your gates, ye rulers, and be ye lifted
up, ye everlasting doors, and the king of glory shall come in.” But they ask again, seeing as
it were His right hand red with blood and His whole person covered with the marks of His
valour, “Why are Thy garments red, and Thy clothes like the treading of the full winefat
when it is trodden?” And to this He answers, “I have crushed them.” For this cause He had
need to wash “His robe in wine, and His garment in the blood of the grape.”4978 For when
He had taken up our infirmities and carried our diseases, and had borne the sin of the whole
world, and had conferred blessings on so many, then, perhaps, He received that baptism
which is greater than any that could ever be conceived among men, and of which I think
He speaks when He says,4979 “I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened
till it be accomplished?” I enquire here with boldness and I challenge the ideas put forward
by most writers. They say that the greatest baptism, beyond which no greater can be conceived,
is His passion. But if this be so, why should He say to Mary after it, “Touch Me
not”? He should rather have offered Himself to her touch, when by His passion He had
received His perfect baptism. But if it was the case, as we said before, that after all His deeds
of valour done against His enemies, He had need to wash “His robe in wine, His garment
in the blood of the grape,” then He was on His way up to the husbandman of the true vine,
the Father, so that having washed there and after having gone up on high, He might lead
captivity captive and come down bearing manifold gifts—the tongues, as of fire, which were
divided to the Apostles, and the holy angels which are to be present with them in each action
and to deliver them. For before these economies they were not yet cleansed and angels
could not dwell with them, for they too perhaps do not desire to be with those who have
not prepared themselves nor been cleansed by Jesus. For it was of Jesus’ benignity alone
that He ate and drank with publicans and sinners, and suffered the penitent woman who
was a sinner to wash His feet with her tears, and went down even to death for the ungodly,
counting it not robbery to be equal with God, and emptied Himself, assuming the form of
a servant. And in accomplishing all this He fulfils rather the will of the Father who gave
Him up for sinners than His own. For the Father is good, but the Saviour is the image of
His goodness; and doing good to the world in all things, since God was in Christ reconciling
the world to Himself, which formerly for its wickedness was all enemy to Him, He accomplishes
His good deeds in order and succession, and does not all at once take all His enemies

for His footstool. For the Father says to Him, to the Lord of us all,4980 “Sit Thou on My
right hand, until I make Thy enemies the footstool of Thy feet.” And this goes on till the
last enemy, Death, is overcome by Him. And if we consider what is meant by this subjection
to Christ and find an explanation of this mainly from the saying,4981 “When all things shall
have been put under Him, then shall the Son Himself be subjected to Him who put all things
under Him,” then we shall see how the conception agrees with the goodness of the God of
all, since it is that of the Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world. Not all men’s sin,
however, is taken away by the Lamb of God, not the sin of those who do not grieve and
suffer affliction till it be taken away. For thorns are not only fixed but deeply rooted in the
hand of every one who is intoxicated by wickedness and has parted with sobriety, as it is
said in the Proverbs,4982 “Thorns grow in the hand of the drunkard,” and what pain they
must cause him who has admitted such growth in the substance of his soul, it is hard even
to tell. Who has allowed wickedness to establish itself so deeply in his soul as to be a ground
full of thorns, he must be cut down by the quick and powerful word of God, which is
sharper than a two-edged sword, and which is more caustic than any fire. To such a soul
that fire must be sent which finds out thorns, and by its divine virtue stands where they are
and does not also burn up the threshing-floors or standing corn. But of the Lamb which
takes away the sin of the world and begins to do so by His own death there are several ways,
some of which are capable of being clearly understood by most, but others are concealed
from most, and are known to those only who are worthy of divine wisdom. Why should
we count up all the ways by which we come to believe among men? That is a thing which
every one living in the body is able to see for himself. And in the ways in which we believe
in these also, sin is taken away; by afflictions and evil spirits and dangerous diseases and
grievous sicknesses. And who knows what follows after this? So much as we have said was
not unnecessary—we could not neglect the thought which is so clearly connected with that
of the words, “Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world,” and had
therefore to attend somewhat closely to this part of our subject. This has brought us to see
that God convicts some by His wrath and chastens them by His anger, since His love to men
is so great that He will not leave any without conviction and chastening; so that we should
do what in us lies to be spared such conviction and such chastening by the sorest trials.</p>

<head>38. The World, of Which the Sin is Taken Away, is Said to Be the Church. Reasons
for Not Agreeing with This Opinion.</head>
<p>The reader will do well to consider what was said above and illustrated from various
quarters on the question what is meant in Scripture by the word “world”; and I think it
proper to repeat this. I am aware that a certain scholar understands by the world the Church
alone, since the Church is the adornment of the world,4983 and is said to be the light of the
world. “You,” he says,4984 “are the light of the world.” Now, the adornment of the world
is the Church, Christ being her adornment, who is the first light of the world. We must
consider if Christ is said to be the light of the same world as His disciples. When Christ is
the light of the world, perhaps it is meant that He is the light of the Church, but when His
disciples are the light of the world, perhaps they are the light of others who call on the Lord,
others in addition to the Church, as Paul says on this point in the beginning of his first
Epistle to the Corinthians, where he writes, “To the Church of God, with all who call on the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ.” Should any one consider that the Church is called the light
of the world, meaning thereby of the rest of the race of men, including unbelievers, this may
be true if the assertion is taken prophetically and theologically; but if it is to be taken of the
present, we remind him that the light of a thing illuminates that thing, and would ask him
to show how the remainder of the race is illuminated by the Church’s presence in the world.
If those who hold the view in question cannot show this, then let them consider if our interpretation
is not a sound one, that the light is the Church, and the world those others who
call on the Name. The words which follow the above in Matthew will point out to the
careful enquirer the proper interpretation. “You,” it is said, “are the salt of the earth,” the
rest of mankind being conceived as the earth, and believers are their salt; it is because they
believe that the earth is preserved. For the end will come if the salt loses its savour, and
ceases to salt and preserve the earth, since it is clear that if iniquity is multiplied and love
waxes cold upon the earth,4985 as the Saviour Himself uttered an expression of doubt as to
those who would witness His coming, saying,4986 “When the Son of man cometh, shall He
find faith upon the earth?” then the end of the age will come. Supposing, then, the Church
to be called the world, since the Saviour’s light shines on it—we have to ask in connection
with the text, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world,” whether
the world here is to be taken intellectually of the Church, and the taking away of sin is limited
to the Church. In that case what are we to make of the saying of the same disciple with regard
to the Saviour, as the propitiation for sin? “If any man sin,” we read, “we have an advocate

with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not
for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole world?” Paul’s dictum appears to me to be
to the same effect, when he says,4987 “Who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.”
Again, Heracleon, dealing with our passage, declares, without any proof or any citation
of witnesses to that effect, that the words, “Lamb of God,” are spoken by John as a prophet,
but the words, “who taketh away the sin of the world,” by John as more than a prophet.
The former expression he considers to be used of His body, but the latter of Him who was
in that body, because the lamb is an imperfect member of the genus sheep; the same being
true of the body as compared with the dweller in it. Had he meant to attribute perfection
to the body he would have spoken of a ram as about to be sacrificed. After the careful discussions
given above, I do not think it necessary to enter into repetitions on this passage,
or to controvert Heracleon’s careless utterances. One point only may be noted, that as the
world was scarcely able to contain Him who had emptied Himself, it required a lamb and
not a ram, that its sin might be taken away.</p>

<head>1. Jesus Comes to Capernaum. Statements of the Four Evangelists Regarding This.</head>
<p>“After this4988 He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and
His disciples; and there they abode not many days. And the passover of the Jews was at
hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and He found in the temple those that sold oxen and
sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting, and He made a sort of scourge of cords,
and cast them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the
small money of the changers and overthrew their tables, and to those that sold the doves
He said, Take these things hence; make not My Father’s house a house of merchandize.
Then His disciples remembered that it was written, that the zeal of thy house shall eat me
up. The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him, What sign showest Thou unto us, that
Thou doest such things? Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up. The Jews therefore answered, Forty-six years was this temple
in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? But He spoke of the temple of His body.
When therefore He rose from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this, and
they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus said. Now when He was at Jerusalem
at the passover at the feast, many believed in His name, beholding His signs which He did.
But Jesus Himself did not trust Himself to them, for that He knew all men, and because He
had no need that any should bear witness concerning man. For He Himself knew what was
in man.”</p>
<p>The numbers which are recorded in the book of that name4989 obtained a place in
Scripture in accordance with some principle which determines their proportion to each
thing. We ought therefore to enquire whether the book of Moses which is called Numbers
teaches us, should we be able to trace it out, in some special way, the principle with regard
to this matter. This remark I make to you at the outset of my tenth book, for in many passages
of Scripture I have observed the number ten to have a peculiar privilege, and you may
consider carefully whether the hope is justified that this volume will bring you from God
some special benefit. That this may prove to be the case, we will seek to yield ourselves as
fully as we can to God, who loves to bestow His choicest gifts. The book begins at the words:
“After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His
disciples, and there they abode not many days.” The other three Evangelists say that the
Lord, after His conflict with the devil, departed into Galilee. Matthew and Luke represent
that he was first at Nazara,4990 and then left them and came and dwelt in Capernaum.
<note type="footnote">4988 John ii. 12–25.</note>
<note type="footnote">4989 The text is doubtful here, but the above seems to be the meaning.</note>
<note type="footnote">4990 Nazara is with Origen a neuter plural.</note>

<pb n="732"/>
Matthew and Mark also state a certain reason why He departed thither, namely, that He
had heard that John was cast into prison. The words are as follows: Matthew says,4991
“Then the devil leaveth Him, and behold, angels came and ministered unto Him. But when
He heard that John was delivered up, He departed into Galilee, and leaving Nazareth He
came and dwelt at Capernaum on the seashore in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali, that
it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun
and the land of Naphtali;” and after the quotation from Isaiah: “From that time Jesus began
to preach and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Mark has the following:
4992 “And He was in the desert forty days and forty nights tempted by Satan, and He
was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto Him. But after John was delivered
up Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of God, that the time is fulfilled and the
kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and believe in the Gospel.” Then after the narrative
about Andrew and Peter and James and John, Mark writes: “And He entered into Capernaum,
and straightway on the Sabbath He was teaching in the synagogue.” Luke has,4993
“And having finished the temptation the devil departed from Him for a season. And Jesus
returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and a fame went out concerning Him into
all the region round about, and He taught in their synagogues being glorified of all. And
He came to Nazara, where He had been brought up, and He entered as His custom was into
the synagogue on the Sabbath day.” Then Luke4994 gives what He said at Nazara, and how
those in the synagogue were enraged at Him and cast Him out of the city and brought Him
to the brow of the hill on which their cities were built, to cast Him down headlong, and how
going through the midst of them the Lord went His way; and with this he connects the
statement, “And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them
on the Sabbath day.”</p>

<head>2. The Discrepancy Between John and the First Three Gospels at This Part of the
Narrative, Literally Read, the Narratives Cannot Be Harmonized: They Must Be
Interpreted Spiritually.</head>
<p>The truth of these matters must lie in that which is seen by the mind. If the discrepancy
between the Gospels is not solved, we must give up our trust in the Gospels, as being true
and written by a divine spirit, or as records worthy of credence, for both these characters
are held to belong to these works. Those who accept the four Gospels, and who do not
consider that their apparent discrepancy is to be solved anagogically (by mystical interpretation),
will have to clear up the difficulty, raised above, about the forty days of the temptation,
a period for which no room can be found in any way in John’s narrative; and they will also
have to tell us when it was that the Lord came to Capernaum. If it was after the six days of
the period of His baptism, the sixth being that of the marriage at Cana of Galilee, then it is
clear that the temptation never took place, and that He never was at Nazara, and that John
was not yet delivered up. Now, after Capernaum, where He abode not many days, the passover
of the Jews was at hand, and He went up to Jerusalem, where He cast the sheep and
oxen out of the temple, and poured out the small change of the bankers. In Jerusalem, too,
it appears that Nicodemus, the ruler and Pharisee, first came to Him by night, and heard
what we may read in the Gospel. “After these things,4995 Jesus came, and His disciples, into
the land of Judæa, and there He tarried with them and baptized, at the same time at which
John also was baptizing in Ænon near Salim, because there were many waters there, and
they came and were baptized; for John was not yet cast into prison.” On this occasion, too,
there was a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with the Jews about purification, and
they came to John, saying of the Saviour, “Behold, He baptizeth, and all come to Him.”
They had heard words from the Baptist, the exact tenor of which it is better to take from
Scripture itself. Now, if we ask when Christ was first in Capernaum, our respondents, if
they follow the words of Matthew, and of the other two, will say, After the temptation, when,
“leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea.” But how can they show
both the statements to be true, that of Matthew and Mark, that it was because He heard that
John was delivered up that He departed into Galilee, and that of John,4996 found there, after
a number of other transactions, subsequent to His stay at Capernaum, after His going to
Jerusalem, and His journey from there to Judæa, that John was not yet cast into prison, but
was baptizing in Ænon near Salim? There are many other points on which the careful student
of the Gospels will find that their narratives do not agree; and these we shall place before
the reader, according to our power, as they occur. The student, staggered at the consideration
of these things, will either renounce the attempt to find all the Gospels true, and not venturing

to conclude that all our information about our Lord is untrustworthy, will choose at random
one of them to be his guide; or he will accept the four, and will consider that their truth is
not to be sought for in the outward and material letter.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="735"/>
<head>3. What We are to Think of the Discrepancies Between the Different Gospels.</head>
<p>We must, however, try to obtain some notion of the intention of the Evangelists in such
matters, and we direct ourselves to this. Suppose there are several men who, by the spirit,
see God, and know His words addressed to His saints, and His presence which He vouchsafes
to them, appearing to them at chosen times for their advancement. There are several such
men, and they are in different places, and the benefits they receive from above vary in shape
and character. And let these men report, each of them separately, what he sees in spirit
about God and His words, and His appearances to His saints, so that one of them speaks of
God’s appearances and words and acts to one righteous man in such a place, and another
about other oracles and great works of the Lord, and a third of something else than what
the former two have dealt with. And let there be a fourth, doing with regard to some particular
matter something of the same kind as these three. And let the four agree with each
other about something the Spirit has suggested to them all, and let them also make brief
reports of other matters besides that one; then their narratives will fall out something on
this wise: God appeared to such a one at such a time and in such a place, and did to him
thus and thus; as if He had appeared to him in such a form, and had led him by the hand
to such a place, and then done to him thus and thus. The second will report that God appeared
at the very time of the foresaid occurrences, in a certain town, to a person who is
named, a second person, and in a place far removed from that of the former account, and
he will report a different set of words spoken at the same time to this second person. And
let the same be supposed to be the case with the third and with the fourth. And let them,
as we said, agree, these witnesses who report true things about God, and about His benefits
conferred on certain men, let them agree with each other in some of the narratives they report.
He, then, who takes the writings of these men for history, or for a representation of
real things by a historical image, and who supposes God to be within certain limits in space,
and to be unable to present to several persons in different places several visions of Himself
at the same time, or to be making several speeches at the same moment, he will deem it
impossible that our four writers are all speaking truth. To him it is impossible that God,
who is in certain limits in space, could at the same set time be saying one thing to one man
and another to another, and that He should be doing a thing and the opposite thing as well,
and, to put it bluntly, that He should be both sitting and standing, should one of the writers
represent Him as standing at the time, and making a certain speech in such a place to such
a man, while a second writer speaks of Him as sitting.</p>

<head>4. Scripture Contains Many Contradictions, and Many Statements Which are Not
Literally True, But Must Be Read Spiritually and Mystically.</head>
<p>In the case I have supposed where the historians desire to teach us by an image what
they have seen in their mind, their meaning would be found, if the four were wise, to exhibit
no disagreement; and we must understand that with the four Evangelists it is not otherwise.
They made full use for their purpose of things done by Jesus in the exercise of His wonderful
and extraordinary power; they use in the same way His sayings, and in some places they
tack on to their writing, with language apparently implying things of sense, things made
manifest to them in a purely intellectual way. I do not condemn them if they even sometimes
dealt freely with things which to the eye of history happened differently, and changed them
so as to subserve the mystical aims they had in view; so as to speak of a thing which happened
in a certain place, as if it had happened in another, or of what took place at a certain time,
as if it had taken place at another time, and to introduce into what was spoken in a certain
way some changes of their own. They proposed to speak the truth where it was possible
both materially and spiritually, and where this was not possible it was their intention to
prefer the spiritual to the material. The spiritual truth was often preserved, as one might
say, in the material falsehood. As, for example, we might judge of the story of Jacob and
Esau.4997 Jacob says to Isaac, “I am Esau thy firstborn son,” and spiritually he spoke the
truth, for he already partook of the rights of the first-born, which were perishing in his
brother, and clothing himself with the goatskins he assumed the outward semblance of Esau,
and was Esau all but the voice praising God, so that Esau might afterward find a place to
receive a blessing. For if Jacob had not been blessed as Esau, neither would Esau perhaps
have been able to receive a blessing of his own. And Jesus too is many things, according to
the conceptions of Him, of which it is quite likely that the Evangelists took up different notions;
while yet they were in agreement with each other in the different things they wrote.
Statements which are verbally contrary to each other, are made about our Lord, namely,
that He was descended from David and that He was not descended from David. The statement
is true, “He was descended from David,” as the Apostle says,4998 “born of the seed of
David according to the flesh,” if we apply this to the bodily part of Him; but the self-same
statement is untrue if we understand His being born of the seed of David of His diviner
power; for He was declared to be the Son of God with power. And for this reason too, perhaps,
the sacred prophecies speak of Him now as a servant, and now as a Son. They call
Him a servant on account of the form of a servant which he wore, and because He was of
the seed of David, but they call Him the Son of God according to His character as first-born.
Thus it is true to call Him man and to call Him not man; man, because He was capable of
<note type="footnote">4997 Gen. xxvii.</note>
<note type="footnote">4998 Rom. i. 3.</note>

<pb n="737"/>
death; not man, on account of His being diviner than man. Marcion, I suppose, took sound
words in a wrong sense, when he rejected His birth from Mary, and declared that as to His
divine nature He was not born of Mary, and hence made bold to delete from the Gospel the
passages which have this effect. And a like fate seems to have overtaken those who make
away with His humanity and receive His deity alone; and also those opposites of these who
cancel His deity and confess Him as a man to be a holy man, and the most righteous of all
men. And those who hold the doctrine of Dokesis, not remembering that He humbled
Himself even unto death4999 and became obedient even to the cross, but only imagining in
Him the absence of suffering, the superiority to all such accidents, they do what they can to
deprive us of the man who is more just than all men, and are left with a figure which cannot
save them, for as by one man came death, so also by one man is the justification of life. We
could not have received such benefit as we have from the Logos had He not assumed the
man, had He remained such as He was from the beginning with God the Father, and had
He not taken up man, the first man of all, the man more precious than all others, purer than
all others and capable of receiving Him. But after that man we also shall be able to receive
Him, to receive Him so great and of such nature as He was, if we prepare a place in proportion
to Him in our soul. So much I have said of the apparent discrepancies in the Gospels, and
of my desire to have them treated in the way of spiritual interpretation.</p>

<head>5. Paul Also Makes Contradictory Statements About Himself, and Acts in Opposite
Ways at Different Times.</head>
<p>On the same passage one may also make use of such an example as that of Paul, who at
one place5000 says that he is carnal, sold under sin, and thus was not able to judge anything,
while in another place he is the spiritual man who is able to judge all things and himself to
be judged by no man. Of the carnal one are the words, “Not what I would that do I practise,
but what I hate that do I.” And he too who was caught up to the third heaven and heard
unspeakable words5001 is a different Paul from him who says, Of such an one I will glory,
but of myself I will not glory. If he becomes5002 to the Jews as a Jew that he may gain the
Jews, and to those under the law as under the law that he may gain those under the law, and
to them that are without law as without law, not being without law to God, but under law
to Christ, that he may gain those without law, and if to the weak he becomes weak that he
may gain the weak, it is clear that these statements must be examined each by itself, that he
becomes a Jew, and that sometimes he is under the law and at another time without law,
and that sometimes he is weak. Where, for example, he says something by way of permission5003
and not by commandment, there we may recognize that he is weak; for who, he
says,5004 is weak, and I am not weak? When he shaves his head and makes an offering,5005
or when he circumcises Timothy,5006 he is a Jew; but when he says to the Athenians,5007 “I
found an altar with the inscription, To the unknown God. That, then, which ye worship
not knowing it, that declare I unto you,” and, “As also some of your own poets have said,
For we also are His offspring,” then he becomes to those without the law as without the law,
adjuring the least religious of men to espouse religion, and turning to his own purpose the
saying of the poet, “From Love do we begin; his race are we.”5008 And instances might
perhaps be found where, to men not Jews and yet under the law, he is under the law.</p>

<head>6. Different Accounts of the Call of Peter, and of the Imprisonment of the Baptist.
The Meaning of “Capernaum.”</head>
<p>These examples may be serviceable to illustrate statements not only about the Saviour,
but about the disciples too, for here also there is some discrepancy of statement. For there
is a difference in thought perhaps between Simon who is found by his own brother Andrew,
and who is addressed “Thou shalt be called Cephas,”5009 and him who is seen by Jesus when
walking by the sea of Galilee,5010 along with his brother, and addressed conjointly with that
brother, “Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” There was some fitness in
the fact that the writer who goes more to the root of the matter and tells of the Word becoming
flesh, and hence does not record the human generation of the Word who was in the
beginning with God, should not tell us of Simon’s being found at the seashore and called
away from there, but of his being found by his brother who had been staying with Jesus at
the tenth hour, and of his receiving the name Cephas in connection with his being thus
found out. If he was seen by Jesus when walking by the sea of Galilee, it would scarcely be
on a later occasion that he was addressed, “Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build
My church.” With John again the Pharisees know Jesus to be baptizing with His disciples,5011
adding this to His other great activities; but the Jesus of the three does not baptize at all.
John the Baptist, too, with the Evangelist of the same name, goes on a long time without
being cast into prison. With Matthew, on the contrary, he is put in prison almost at the
time of the temptation of Jesus, and this is the occasion of Jesus retiring to Galilee, to avoid
being put in prison. But in John there is nothing at all about John’s being put in prison.
Who is so wise and so able as to learn all the things that are recorded about Jesus in the four
Evangelists, and both to understand each incident by itself, and have a connected view of
all His sojournings and words and acts at each place? As for the passage presently before
us, it gives in the order of events that on the sixth day the Saviour, after the business of the
marriage at Cana of Galilee, went down with His mother and His brothers and His disciples
to Capernaum, which means “field of consolation.” For after the feasting and the wine it
was fitting that the Saviour should come to the field of consolation with His mother and
His disciples, to console those whom He was training for disciples and the soul which had
conceived Him by the Holy Ghost, with the fruits which were to stand in that full field.</p>

<head>7. Why His Brothers are Not Called to the Wedding; And Why He Abides at Capernaum
Not Many Days.</head>
<p>But we must ask why His brothers are not called to the wedding: they were not there,
for it is not said they were; but they go down to Capernaum with Him and His mother and
His disciples. We must also examine why on this occasion they do not “go in to” Capernaum,
nor “go up to,” but “go down to” it. Consider if we must not understand by His brothers
here the powers which went down along with Him, not called to the wedding according to
the explanations given above, since it is in lower and humbler places than those who are
called disciples of Christ, and in another way, that these brothers receive assistance. For if
His mother is called, then there are some bearing fruit, and even to these the Lord goes
down with the servants and disciples of the Word, to help such persons, His mother also
being with Him. Those indeed who are called Capernaum appear not to be able to allow
Jesus and those who went down with Him to make a longer stay with them: hence they remain
with them not many days. For the lower field of consolation does not admit the illumination
of many doctrines, but is only capable of a few. To get a clear view of the difference
between those who receive Jesus for longer and for shorter time, we may compare with this,
“They abode there not many days,” the words recorded in Matthew as spoken by Christ
when risen from the dead to His disciples who were being sent out to teach all nations,5012
“Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.” To those who are to know
all that human nature can know while it still is here, is said with emphasis, “I am with you;”
and as the rise of each new day upon the field of contemplation brings more days before
the eyes of the blessed, therefore He says, “All the days till the end of the world.” As for
those in Capernaum, on the contrary, to whom they go down as to the more needy, not only
Jesus, but also His mother and His brothers and His disciples “abode there not many days.”</p>

<head>8. How Christ Abides with Believers to the End of the Age, and Whether He Abides
with Them After that Consummation.</head>
<p>Some may very likely and not unreasonably ask, whether, when all the days of this age
are over, there will no longer be any one to say, “Lo, I am with you,” with those, namely,
who received Him till the fulfilment of the age, for the “until” seems to indicate a certain
limit of time. To this we must say that the phrase, “I am with you,” is not the same as “I am
in you.” We might say more properly that the Saviour was not in His disciples but with
them, so long as they had not arrived in their minds at the consummation of the age. But
when they see to be at hand, as far as their effort is concerned, the consummation of the
world which is crucified to them, then Jesus will be no longer with them, but in them, and
they will say, “It is no longer I that live but Christ that lives in me,”5013 and “If ye seek a
proof of Christ that speaketh in me.”5014 In saying this we are keeping for our part also to
the ordinary interpretation which makes the “always” the time down to the consummation
of the age, and are not asking more than is attainable to human nature as it is here. That
interpretation may be adhered to and justice yet be done to the “I.” He who is with His
disciples who are sent out to teach all the nations, until the consummation, may be He who
emptied Himself and took the form of a servant, and yet afterwards may be another in point
of state; afterwards He may be such as He was before He emptied Himself, until all His enemies
are made by His Father the footstool of His feet; and after this, when the Son has delivered
up the kingdom to God and the Father, it may be the Father who says to them, “Behold,
I am with you.” But whether it is “all the days” up to that time, or simply “all the days,”
or not “all days” but “every day,” any one may consider that likes. Our plan does not allow
us at present to digress so far.</p>

<head>9. Heracleon Says that Jesus is Not Stated to Have Done Anything at Capernaum.
But in the Other Gospels He Does Many Things There.</head>
<p>But Heracleon, dealing with the words, “After this He went down to Capernaum,” declares
that they indicate the introduction of another transaction, and that the word “went
down” is not without significance. “Capernaum,” he says, “means these farthest-out parts
of the world, these districts of matter, into which He descended, and because the place was
not suitable, he says, He is not reported either to have done anything or said anything in
it.” Now if the Lord had not been reported in the other Gospels either as having done or
said anything at Capernaum, we might perhaps have hesitated whether this view ought or
ought not to be received. But that is far from being the case. Matthew says our Lord left
Nazareth and came and dwelt at Capernaum on the seaside, and that from that time He
began to preach, saying, “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” And Mark,
starting in his narrative5015 from the temptation by the devil, relates that after John was cast
into prison, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the Gospel of God, and after the call of the
four fishermen to the Apostleship, “they enter into Capernaum; and straightway on the
Sabbath day He taught in the synagogue, and they were astonished at His doctrine.” And
Mark records an action of Jesus also which took place at Capernaum, for he goes on to say,
“In their synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying, Ah!
what have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art Thou come to destroy us? We
know Thee who Thou art, the Son of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace
and come out of him; and the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came
out of him. And they were all amazed.” And at Capernaum Simon’s mother-in-law is cured
of her fever. And Mark adds that when evening was come all those were cured who were
sick and who were possessed with demons. Luke’s report is very like Mark’s about Capernaum.
5016 He says, “And He came to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching
them on the Sabbath day, and they were astonished at His teachings, for His word was with
power. And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he
cried out with a loud voice, Ah! what have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?
Hast Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, the holy one of God. And Jesus
rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him. Then the demon having thrown
him down in the midst, went out of him, doing him no harm.” And then Luke reports how
the Lord rose up from the synagogue and went into the house of Simon, and rebuked the
fever in his mother-in-law, and cured her of her disease; and after this cure, “when the sun
was setting,” he says, “all, as many as had persons sick with divers diseases, brought them
to Him, and He laid his hands on each one of them and cured them. And demons also went

out from many, crying and saying, Thou art the Son of God, and He rebuked them and
suffered them not to speak because they knew that He was the Christ.” We have presented
all these statements as to the Saviour’s sayings and doings at Capernaum in order to refute
Heracleon’s interpretation of our passage, “Hence He is not said to have done or to have
spoken anything there.” He must either give two meanings to Capernaum, and show us his
reasons for them, or if he cannot do this he must give up saying that the Saviour visited any
place to no purpose. We, for our part, should we come to passages where even a comparison
of the other Gospels fails to show that Jesus’ visit to this place or that was not accompanied
by any results, will seek with the divine assistance to make it clear that His coming was not
in vain.</p>

<head>10. Significance of Capernaum.</head>
<p>Matthew for his part adds,5017 that when the Lord had entered into Capernaum the
centurion came to him, saying, “My boy is lying in my house sick of the palsy, grievously
tormented,” and after telling the Lord some more about him, received the reply, “Go, and
as thou hast believed, so be it unto thee.” And Matthew then gives us the story of Peter’s
mother-in-law, in close agreement with the other two. I conceive it to be a creditable piece
of work and becoming to one who is anxious to hear about Christ, to collect from the four
Gospels all that is related about Capernaum, and the discourses spoken, and the works done
there, and how many visits the Lord paid to the place, and how, at one time, He is said to
have gone down to it, and at another to have entered into it, and where He came from when
He did so. If we compare all these points together, we shall not go astray in the meaning
we ascribe to Capernaum. On the one hand, the sick are healed, and other works of power
are done there, and on the other, the preaching, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand, begins there, and this appears to be a sign, as we showed when entering on this subject,
of some more needy place of consolation, made so perhaps by Jesus, who comforted men
by what He taught and by what He did there, in that place of consolation. For we know that
the names of places agree in their meaning with the things connected with Jesus; as Gergesa,
where the citizens of these parts besought Him to depart out of their coasts, means, “The
dwelling of the casters-out.” And this, also, we have noticed about Capernaum, that not
only did the preaching, “Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” begin there, but
that according to the three Evangelists Jesus performed there His first miracles. None of
the three, however, added to the first wonders which he records as done in Capernaum, that
note attached by John the disciple to the first work of Jesus, “This beginning of His signs
did Jesus in Cana of Galilee.” For that which was done in Capernaum was not the beginning
of the signs, since the leading sign of the Son of God was good cheer, and in the light of
human experience it is also the most representative of Him. For the Word of God does not
show forth His own beauty so much in healing the sick, as in His tendering the temperate
draught to make glad those who are in good health and are able to join in the banquet.</p>

<head>11. Why the Passover is Said to Be that of the “Jews.” Its Institution: and the Distinction
Between “Feasts of the Lord” And Feasts Not So Spoken of.</head>
<p>“And the passover of the Jews was at hand.”5018 Inquiring into the accuracy of the most
wise John (on this passage), I put myself the question, What is indicated by the addition “of
the Jews”? Of what other nation was the passover a festival? Would it not have been enough
to say, “And the passover was at hand”? It may, however, be the case that the human passover
is one thing when kept by men not as Scripture intended, and that the divine passover
is another thing, the true passover, observed in spirit and truth by those who worship God
in spirit and in truth; and then the distinction indicated in the text may be that between the
divine passover and that said to be of the Jews. We should attend to the passover law and
observe what the Lord says of it when it is first mentioned in Scripture.5019 “And the Lord
spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, This month is to you the beginning
of months, it is the first for you among the months of the year. Speak thou to all the congregation
of the children of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this month shall every man take
a sheep, according to the houses of your families;” then after some directions in which the
word passover does not occur again, he adds,5020 “Thus shall ye eat it, your loins girt and
your shoes on your feet, and your staves in your hands, and ye shall eat it with haste. It is
the passover of the Lord.” He does not say, “It is your passover.” And a little further on He
names the festival again in the same way,5021 “And it shall come to pass, when your sons
say to you, What is this service? And ye shall say to them, It is the sacrifice, the passover of
the Lord, how He guarded the houses of the children of Israel.” And again, a little further
on,5022 “And the Lord spake to Moses and Aaron, saying, This is the law of the passover.
No alien shall eat of it.” And again in a little,5023 “But if a proselyte come to you, and keep
the passover of the Lord, every male of him shall be circumcised.” Observe that in the law
we never find it said, “Your passover;” but in all the passages quoted the phrase occurs once
without any adjunct, while we have three times “The passover of the Lord.” To make sure
that there is such a distinction between the passover of the Lord and the passover of the
Jews, we may consider the way in which Isaiah speaks of the matter:5024 “Your new moons
and your Sabbaths and your great day I cannot bear; your fast and your holiday and your

<pb n="746"/>
new moons and your feasts my soul hateth.” The Lord does not call them His own, these
observances of sinners (they are hated of His soul, if such there be); neither the new moons,
nor the Sabbaths, nor the great day, nor the fast, nor the festivals. And in the legislation
about the Sabbath in Exodus, we read,5025 “And Moses said unto them, This is the word
which the Lord spake, The Sabbath is a holy rest unto the Lord.” And a little further on,
“And Moses said, Eat ye; for to-day is a Sabbath unto the Lord.” And in Numbers,5026 before
the sacrifices which are offered at each festival, as if all the festivals came under the law of
the continuous and daily sacrifice, we find it written, “And the Lord spake unto Moses,
Announce to the children of Israel, and thus shalt thou say unto them, My gifts, My offerings,
My fruits for a smell of sweet savour, ye shall observe to offer unto Me at My festivals. And
thou shalt say unto them, These are the offerings which ye shall offer unto the Lord.” The
festival set forth in Scripture He calls His own, not those of the people receiving the law, He
speaks of His gifts, His offerings. A similar way of speaking is that in Exodus with regard
to the people; it is said by God to be His own people, when it does not sin; but in the section
about the calf He abjures it and calls it the people of Moses.5027 On the one hand, “Thou
shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the
wilderness. But if thou wilt not let My people go, behold, I will send against thee and against
thy servants, and against thy people and against thy houses, the dog-fly; and the houses of
the Egyptians shall be full of the dog-fly, and on the land on which they are, against it will
I send them. And I will glorify on that day the land of Gesem, on which My people are; on
it there shall be no dog-fly, that thou mayest know that I am the Lord, the Lord of all the
earth. And I will make a distinction between My people and thy people.” To Moses, on the
other hand, He says,5028 “Go, descend quickly, for thy people hath transgressed, which thou
leddest out of the land of Egypt.” As, then, the people when it does not sin is the people of
God, but when it sins is no longer spoken of as His, thus, also, the feasts when they are hated
by the Lord’s soul are said to be feasts of sinners, but when the law is given regarding them,
they are called feasts of the Lord. Now of these feasts passover is one, which in the passage
before us is said to be that not of the Lord, but of the Jews. In another passage, too,5029 we
find it said, “These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall call chosen, holy.” From the
mouth of the Lord Himself, then, we see that there is no gainsaying our statement on this
point. Some one, no doubt, will ask about the words of the Apostle, where he writes to the
Corinthians:5030 “For our Passover also was sacrificed for us, namely, Christ;” he does not

say, “The Passover of the Lord was sacrificed, even Christ.” To this we must say, either that
the Apostle simply calls the passover our passover because it was sacrificed for us, or that
every sacrifice which is really the Lord’s, and the passover is one of these, awaits its consummation
not in this age nor upon earth, but in the coming age and in heaven when the kingdom
of heaven appears. As for those feasts, one of the twelve prophets says,5031 “What will
ye do in the days of assembly, and in the days of the feast of the Lord?” But Paul says in the
Epistle to the Hebrews:5032 “But ye are come unto Mount Zion, and to the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to ten thousands of angels, the assembly and church of
the firstborn, who are written in heaven.” And in the Epistle to the Colossians:5033 “Let no
one judge you in meat and in drink, or in respect of a feast-day or a new moon, or a sabbathday;
which are a shadow of the things to come.”</p>

<head>12. Of the Heavenly Festivals, of Which Those on Earth are Typical.</head>
<p>Now in what manner, in those heavenly things of which the shadow was present to the
Jews on earth, those will celebrate festivals who have first been trained by tutors and governors
under the true law, until the fulness of the time should come, namely, above, when
we shall be able to receive into ourselves the perfect measure of the Son of God, this it is the
work of that wisdom to make plain which has been hidden in a mystery; and it also may
show to our thought how the laws about meats are symbols of those things which will there
nourish and strengthen our soul. But it is vain to think that one desiring to work out in his
fancy the great sea of such ideas, even if he wished to show how local worship is still a pattern
and shadow of heavenly things, and that the sacrifices and the sheep are full of meaning,
that he should advance further than the Apostle, who seeks indeed to lift our minds above
earthly views of the law, but who does not show us to any extent how these things are to be.
Even if we look at the festivals, of which passover is one, from the point of view of the age
to come, we have still to ask how it is that our passover is now sacrificed, namely, Christ,
and not only so, but is to be sacrificed hereafter.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
<pb n="749"/>
<head>13. Spiritual Meaning of the Passover.</head>
<p>A few points may be added in connection with the doctrines now under consideration,
though it would require a special discussion in many volumes to treat of all the mystical
statements about the law, and specially of those connected with the festivals, and more
particularly still with the passover. The passover of the Jews consists of a sheep which is
sacrificed, each taking a sheep according to his father’s house; and the passover is accompanied
by the slaughter of thousands of rams and goats, in proportion to the number of the
houses of the people. But our Passover is sacrificed for us, namely, Christ. Another feature
of the Jewish festival is unleavened bread; all leaven is made to disappear out of their houses;
but “we keep the feast5034 not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and
wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” Whether there be any
passover and any feast of leaven beyond the two we have mentioned, is a point we must
examine more carefully, since these serve for a pattern and a shadow of the heavenly ones
we spoke of, and not only such things as food and drink and new moons and sabbaths, but
the festivals also, are a shadow of the things to come. In the first place, when the Apostle
says, “Our passover is sacrificed, Christ,” one may feel with regard to this such doubts as
these. If the sheep with the Jews is a type of the sacrifice of Christ, then one should have
been offered and not a multitude, as Christ is one; or if many sheep were offered it is to
follow out the type, as if many Christs were sacrificed. But not to dwell on this, we may ask
how the sheep, which was the victim, contains an image of Christ, when the sheep was sacrificed
by men who were observing the law, but Christ was put to death by transgressors of
the law, and what application can be found in Christ of the direction,5035 “They shall eat
the flesh this night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread on bitter herbs shall they eat,” and
“Eat not of it raw, nor sodden with water, but roast with fire; the head with the feet and the
entrails; ye shall not set any of it apart till the morning, and a bone thereof ye shall not break.
But that which is left thereof till the morning ye shall burn.” The sentence, “A bone of it ye
shall not break,” John appears to have made use of in his Gospel, as applying to the transactions
connected with Christ, and connecting with them the occasion spoken of in the law
when those eating the sheep are bidden not to break a bone of it. He writes as follows:5036
“The soldiers therefore came and brake the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified
with him; but when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they brake not
His legs, but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His side, and straightway there came
out blood and water. And he that hath seen hath borne witness and his witness is true, and
he knoweth that he sayeth truth that ye also may believe. And these things took place that

<note type="footnote">5035 Exod. xii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">5036 xix. 32.</note>

<pb n="750"/>
the Scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of Him ye shall not break.” There are a myriad
other points besides this in the Apostle’s language which would call for inquiry, both about
the passover and the unleavened bread, but they would have to be dealt with, as we said
above, in a special work of great length. At present we can only give an epitome of them as
they bear on the text presently before us, and aim at a short solution of the principal problem.
We call to mind the words, “This is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world,”
for it is said of the passover,5037 “Ye shall take it of the lambs or of the goats.” The Evangelist
here agrees with Paul, and both are involved in the difficulties we spoke of above. But on
the other hand we have to say that if the Word became flesh, and the Lord says,5038 “Unless
ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you. He that eateth
My flesh and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
For My flesh is meat indeed and My blood is drink indeed. He that eateth My flesh and
drinketh My blood abideth in Me, and I in him,”—then the flesh thus spoken of is that of
the Lamb that takes away the sin of the world; and this is the blood, some of which was to
be put on the two side posts of the door, and on the lintels in the houses, in which we eat
the passover. Of the flesh of this Lamb it is necessary that we should eat in the time of the
world, which is night, and the flesh is to be roast with fire, and eaten with unleavened bread;
for the Word of God is not flesh and flesh only. He says, in fact, Himself,5039 “I am the
bread of life,” and “This is the bread of life which came down from heaven, that a man
should eat of it, and not die. I am the bread of life that came down from heaven; if a man
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever.” We must not overlook, however, that by a loose use
of words, any food is called bread, as we read in Moses in Deuteronomy,5040 “Forty days
He ate no bread and drank no water,” instead of, He took no food, either wet or dry. I am
led to this observation by John’s saying, “And the bread which I will give is My flesh, for
the life of the world.” Again, we eat the flesh of the Lamb, with bitter herbs, and unleavened
bread, when we repent of our sins and grieve with the sorrow which is according to God, a
repentance which operates for our salvation, and is not to be repented of; or when, on account
of our trials, we turn to the speculations which are found to be those of truth, and are
nourished by them. We are not, however, to eat the flesh of the Lamb raw, as those do who
are slaves of the letter, like irrational animals, and those who are enraged at men truly
reasonable, because they desire to understand spiritual things; truly, they share the nature
of savage beasts. But we must strive to convert the rawness of Scripture into well-cooked
food, not letting what is written grow flabby and wet and thin, as those do who have itching
<note type="footnote">5037 Exod. xii. 5.</note>

<note type="footnote">5040 ix. 9.</note>

<pb n="751"/>
ears,5041 and turn away their ears from the truth; their methods tend to a loose and flabby
conduct of life. But let us be of a fervent spirit and keep hold of the fiery words given to us
of God, such as Jeremiah received from Him who spoke to him,5042 “Behold, I have made
My words in thy mouth like fire,” and let us see that the flesh of the Lamb be well cooked,
so that those who partake of it may say, as Christ speaks in us, “Our heart burned by the
way, as He opened to us the Scriptures.”5043 Further, if it is our duty to enquire into such
a point as the roasting of the flesh of the Lamb with fire, we must not forget the parallel of
what Jeremiah suffered on account of the words of God, as he says:5044 “And it was as a
glowing fire, burning in my bones, and I am without any strength, and I cannot bear it.”
But, in this eating, we must begin at the head, that is to say, at the principal and the most
essential doctrines about heavenly things, and we must end at the feet, the last branches of
learning which enquire as to the final nature in things, or about more material things, or
about things under the earth, or about wicked spirits and unclean demons. For it may be
that the account of these things is not obvious, like themselves, but is laid away among the
mysteries of Scripture, so that it may be called, tropically, the feet of the Lamb. Nor must
we fail to deal with the entrails, which are within and hidden from us; we must approach
the whole of Scripture as one body, we must not lacerate nor break through the strong and
well-knit connections which exist in the harmony of its whole composition, as those do who
lacerate, so far as they can, the unity of the Spirit that is in all the Scriptures. But this
aforesaid prophecy of the Lamb is to be our nourishment only during the night of this dark
life of ours; what comes after this life is, as it were, the dawn of day, and why should we leave
over till then the food which can only be useful to us now? But when the night is passed,
and the day which succeeds it is at hand, then we shall have bread to eat which has nothing
to do with the leavened bread of the older and lower state of things, but is unleavened, and
that will serve our turn until that which comes after the unleavened bread is given us, the
manna, which is food for angels rather than men. Every one of us, then, may sacrifice his
lamb in every house of our fathers; and while one breaks the law, not sacrificing the lamb
at all, another may keep the commandment entirely, offering his sacrifice, and cooking it
aright, and not breaking a bone of it. This, then, in brief, is the interpretation of the Passover
sacrificed for us, which is Christ, in accordance with the view taken of it by the Apostles,
and with the Lamb in the Gospel. For we ought not to suppose that historical things are
types of historical things, and material things of material, but that material things are typical
of spiritual things, and historical things of intellectual. It is not necessary that our discourse

should now ascend to that third passover which is to be celebrated with myriads of angels

greater extent than the passage demands.</p>

<head>14. In the First Three Gospels the Passover is Spoken of Only at the Close of the
Ministry; In John at the Beginning. Remarks on This. Heracleon on the Passover.</head>
<p>We must not, however, fail to enquire into the statement that the passover of the Jews
was at hand, when the Lord was at Capernaum with His mother and His brothers and His
disciples. In the Gospel according to Matthew,5045 after being left by the devil, and after
the angels came and ministered to Him, when He heard that John was delivered up He
withdrew into Galilee, and leaving Nazara He came and dwelt in Capernaum. Then He
began to preach, and chose the four fishermen for His Apostles, and taught in the synagogues
of the whole of Galilee and healed those who were brought to Him. Then He goes up into
the mountain and speaks the beatitudes and what follows them; and after finishing that instruction
He comes down from the mountain and enters Capernaum a second time.5046
Then He embarked in a ship and crossed over to the other side to the country of the
Gergesenes. On their beseeching Him to depart out of their coasts He embarked5047 in a
ship and crossed over and came to His own city. Then He wrought certain cures and went
about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues; after this most of the events
of the Gospels take place, before Matthew indicates the approach of the time of passover.5048
With the other Evangelists also, after the stay at Capernaum it is long till we come to any
mention of the passover; which may confirm in their opinion those who take the view about
Capernaum which was set forth above. That stay, in the neighbourhood of the passover of
the Jews, is set in a brighter light by that nearness, both because it was better in itself, and
still more because at the passover of the Jews there are found in the temple those who sell
oxen and sheep and doves. This adds emphasis to the statement that the passover was not
that of the Lord but that of the Jews; the Father’s house was made, in the eyes of those who
did not hallow it, a house of merchandise, and the passover of the Lord became for those
who took a low and material view of it a Jewish passover. A fitter occasion than the present
will occur for enquiring as to the time of the passover, which took place about the spring
equinox, and for any other enquiry which may arise in connection with it. As for Heracleon,
he says, “This is the great festival; for it was a type of the passion of the Saviour; not only
was the lamb put to death, the eating of it afforded relaxation, the killing it pointed to what
of the passion of the Saviour was in this world, and the eating it to the rest at the marriage.”
We have given his words, that it may be seen with what a want of caution and how loosely
he proceeds, and with what an absence of constructive skill even on such a theme as this;
and how little regard in consequence is to be paid to him.</p>

<head>15. Discrepancy of the Gospel Narratives Connected with the Cleansing of the
Temple.</head>
<p>“And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.5049 And He found in the temple those that sold oxen
and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting; and He made a scourge of cords,
and cast out of the temple the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the small coin of the
changers, and overturned their tables, and to those who sold the doves He said, Take these
things hence; make not My Father’s house a house of merchandise. Then His disciples remembered
that it was written, The zeal of thy house shall eat me up.” It is to be noted that
John makes this transaction of Jesus with those He found selling oxen and sheep and doves
in the temple His second work; while the other Evangelists narrate a similar incident almost
at the end and in connection with the story of the passion. Matthew has it thus:5050 “At
Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem the whole city was stirred, saying, Who is this? And the multitudes
said, This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee. And Jesus went into the temple
and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and He overturned the tables of
the money-changers and the seats of them that sold doves. And He says to them, It is written,
My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you make it a den of robbers.” Mark has the
following: “And they came to Jerusalem. And having entered into the temple He began to
cast out those that sold and bought in the temple, and the tables of the money-changers He
overthrew and the seats of them that sold doves. And He suffered not that any should carry
a vessel through the temple; and He taught and said unto them, Is it not written that My
house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of
robbers.” And Luke:5051 “And when he came near, He beheld the city and wept over it,
saying that, if thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things that belong to peace; but
now they are hid from thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, when they shall surround
thee and shut thee in on every side, and shall dash thee to the ground and thy children,
and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time
of thy visitation. And He entered into the temple and began to cast out those that sold,
saying to them, It is written, My house shall be a house of prayer, but ye have made it a den
of robbers.” It is further to be observed that what is recorded by the three as having taken
place in connection with the Lord’s going up to Jerusalem, when He did these things in the
temple, is narrated in a very similar manner by John as taking place long after this, after
another visit to Jerusalem different from this one. We must consider the statements, and
in the first place that of Matthew, where we read:5052 “When He drew nigh to Jerusalem

and came to Bethphage over against the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
saying unto them, Go ye into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an
ass tied and a colt with her; loose them and bring them to Me. And if any man say unto
you, What are you doing? you shall say, The Lord hath need of them, and straightway he
will send them. But this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophet, saying, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy king cometh, meek and seated
upon an ass and upon the colt of an ass. And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded
them; they brought the ass and the foal, and they placed on them their garments, and He
sat thereon. And the most part of the multitude spread their garments on the road, but the
multitudes that went before Him, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna to the Son of
David, blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.” After
this comes, “And when He had entered into Jerusalem the whole city was stirred,” which
we cited above. Then we have Mark’s account:5053 “And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem,
to Bethphage and Bethany, to the Mount of Olives, He sends two of His disciples and
says to them, Go ye into the village over against you. And straightway as ye enter into it ye
shall find a colt tied, on which no man hath ever sat, loose it and bring it. And if any one
say to you, Why do ye this? say, Because the Lord hath need of him, and straightway he will
send him back hither. And they went and found the colt tied at the door outside on the
road, and they loose him. And some of them that stood there said to them, What do ye,
loosing the colt? And they said to them as Jesus told them, and they let them go. And they
brought the colt to Jesus, and cast on it their garments. But others cut down branches from
the field and spread them in the way. And they that went before and they that followed
cried, Hosanna, blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord; blessed be the kingdom
that cometh, of our father David! Hosanna in the highest! And He went into Jerusalem to
the temple, and looked round about on all things, and as it was already evening, He went
out to Bethany with the twelve. And on the morrow when they were come forth from
Bethany He was hungry.” Then, after the affair of the withered fig tree, “They came to Jerusalem.
And He went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold.” Luke narrates
as follows:5054 “And it came to pass, when He drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the
mount that is called the Mount of Olives, He sent two of his disciples, saying, Go ye into
the village over against you, in which when ye enter, ye shall find a colt tied, on which no
man ever hath sate; loose him and bring him. And if any man asks you, Why do ye loose
him? Ye shall say thus, The Lord hath need of him. And the disciples went and found as
He said to them. And when they were loosing the colt its owners said to them, Why loose

ye the colt? and they said, Because the Lord hath need of him. And they brought him to
Jesus, and they threw their garments on the colt, and set Jesus thereon. And as He went,
they strewed their garments in the way. And when He was drawing near, being now at the
descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and
praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen, saying, Blessed
is the King in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven and glory in the highest. And some of
the Pharisees from the multitude said unto Him, Master, rebuke Thy disciples. And He
answered and said, I say unto you, If these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
And when He drew near He beheld the city and wept over it,” and so on, as we cited above.
John, on the contrary, after giving an account nearly identical with this, as far as, “And Jesus
went up to Jerusalem, and He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep,”
gives a second account of an ascent of the Lord to Jerusalem, and then goes on to tell of the
supper in Bethany six days before the passover, at which Martha served and Lazarus was at
table. “On the morrow,5055 a great multitude that had come to the feast, having heard that
Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet Him;
and they cried, Hosanna, blessed be the King of Israel in the name of the Lord. And Jesus,
having found a young ass, sat thereon, as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold
thy King cometh, sitting on the foal of an ass.” I have written out long sections from the
Gospels, but I have thought it necessary to do so, in order to exhibit the discrepancy at this
part of our Gospel. Three of the Gospels place these incidents, which we supposed to be
the same as those narrated by John, in connection with one visit of the Lord to Jerusalem.
While John, on the other hand, places them in connection with two visits which are widely
separated from each other and between which were various journeys of the Lord to other
places. I conceive it to be impossible for those who admit nothing more than the history in
their interpretation to show that these discrepant statements are in harmony with each
other. If any one considers that we have not given a sound exposition, let him write a
reasoned rejoinder to this declaration of ours.</p>

<head>16. The Story of the Purging of the Temple Spiritualized. Taken Literally, It Presents
Some Very Difficult and Unlikely Features.</head>
<p>We shall, however, expound according to the strength that is given to us the reasons
which move us to recognize here a harmony; and in doing so we entreat Him who gives to
every one that asks and strives acutely to enquire, and we knock that by the keys of higher
knowledge the hidden things of Scripture may be opened to us. And first, let us fix our attention
on the words of John, beginning, “And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.”5056 Now Jerusalem,
as the Lord Himself teaches in the Gospel according to Matthew,5057 “is the city of
the great King.” It does not lie in a depression, or in a low situation, but is built on a high
mountain, and there are mountains round about it,5058 and the participation of it is to the
same place,5059 and thither the tribes of the Lord went up, a testimony for Israel. But that
city also is called Jerusalem, to which none of those upon the earth ascends, nor goes in; but
every soul that possesses by nature some elevation and some acuteness to perceive the things
of the mind is a citizen of that city. And it is possible even for a dweller in Jerusalem to be
in sin (for it is possible for even the acutest minds to sin), should they not turn round quickly
after their sin, when they have lost their power of mind and are on the point not only of
dwelling in one of those strange cities of Judæa, but even of being inscribed as its citizens.
Jesus goes up to Jerusalem, after bringing help to those in Cana of Galilee, and then going
down to Capernaum, that He may do in Jerusalem the things which are written. He found
in the temple, certainly, which is said to be the house of the Father of the Saviour, that is,
in the church or in the preaching of the ecclesiastical and sound word, some who were
making His Father’s house a house of merchandise. And at all times Jesus finds some of
this sort in the temple. For in that which is called the church, which is the house of the living
God, the pillar and ground of the truth,5060 when are there not some money-changers sitting
who need the strokes of the scourge Jesus made of small cords, and dealers in small coin
who require to have their money poured out and their tables overturned? When are there
not those who are inclined to merchandise, but need to be held to the plough and the oxen,
that having put their hand to it and not turning round to the things behind them, they may
be fit for the kingdom of God? When are there not those who prefer the mammon of unrighteousness
to the sheep which give them the material for their true adornment? And
there are always many who look down on what is sincere and pure and unmixed with any
bitterness or gall, and who, for the sake of miserable gain, betray the care of those tropically

called doves. When, therefore, the Saviour finds in the temple, the house of His Father,
those who are selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting, He
drives them out, using the scourge of small cords which He has made, along with the sheep
and oxen of their trade, and pours out their stock of coin, as not deserving to be kept together,
so little is it worth. He also overturns the tables in the souls of such as love money, saying
even to those who sell doves, “Take these things hence,” that they may no longer traffic in
the house of God. But I believe that in these words He indicated also a deeper truth, and
that we may regard these occurrences as a symbol of the fact that the service of that temple
was not any longer to be carried on by the priests in the way of material sacrifices, and that
the time was coming when the law could no longer be observed, however much the Jews
according to the flesh desired it. For when Jesus casts out the oxen and sheep, and orders
the doves to be taken away, it was because oxen and sheep and doves were not much longer
to be sacrificed there in accordance with Jewish practices. And possibly the coins which
bore the stamp of material things and not of God were poured out by way of type; because
the law which appears so venerable, with its letter that kills, was, now that Jesus had come
and had used His scourge to the people, to be dissolved and poured out, the sacred office
(episcopate) being transferred to those from the Gentiles who believed, and the kingdom
of God being taken away from the Jews5061 and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
of it. But it may also be the case that the natural temple is the soul skilled in reason, which,
because of its inborn reason, is higher than the body; to which Jesus ascends from Capernaum,
the lower-lying place of less dignity, and in which, before Jesus’ discipline is applied
to it, are found tendencies which are earthly and senseless and dangerous, and things which
have the name but not the reality of beauty, and which are driven away by Jesus with His
word plaited out of doctrines of demonstration and of rebuke, to the end that His Father’s
house may no longer be a house of merchandize but may receive, for its own salvation and
that of others, that service of God which is performed in accordance with heavenly and
spiritual laws. The ox is symbolic of earthly things, for he is a husbandman. The sheep, of
senseless and brutal things, because it is more servile than most of the creatures without
reason. Of empty and unstable thoughts, the dove. Of things that are thought good but are
not, the small change. If any one objects to this interpretation of the passage and says that
it is only pure animals that are mentioned in it, we must say that the passage would otherwise
have an unlikely air. The occurence is necessarily related according to the possibilities of
the story. It could not have been narrated that a herd of any other animals than pure ones
had found access to the temple, nor could any have been sold there but those used for sacrifice.
The Evangelist makes use of the known practice of the merchants at the times of the
Jewish feasts; they did bring in such animals to the outer court; this practice, with a real
<note type="footnote">5061 Matt. xxi. 43.</note>

<pb n="759"/>
occurrence He knew of, were His materials. Any one, however, who cares to do so may
enquire whether it is in agreement with the position held by Jesus in this world, since He
was reputed to be the Son of a carpenter, to venture upon such an act as to drive out a crowd
of merchants from the temple? They had come up to the feast to sell to a great number of
the people, the sheep, several myriads in number, which they were to sacrifice according to
their fathers’ houses. To the richer Jews they had oxen to sell, and there were doves for
those who had vowed such animals, and many no doubt bought these with a view to their
good cheer at the festival. And did not Jesus do an unwarrantable thing when He poured
out the money of the money-changers, which was their own, and overthrew their tables?
And who that received a blow from the scourge of small cords at the hands of One held in
but slight esteem, was driven out of the temple, would not have attacked Him and raised a
cry and avenged himself with his own hand, especially when there was such a multitude
present who might all feel themselves insulted by Jesus in the same way? To think, moreover,
of the Son of God taking the small cords in His hands and plaiting a scourge out of them
for this driving out from the temple, does it not bespeak audacity and temerity and even
some measure of lawlessness? One refuge remains for the writer who wishes to defend these
things and is minded to treat the occurrence as real history, namely, to appeal to the divine
nature of Jesus, who was able to quench, when He desired to do so, the rising anger of His
foes, by divine grace to get the better of myriads, and to scatter the devices of tumultuous
men; for “the Lord scatters the counsels of the nations5062 and brings to naught devices of
the peoples, but the counsel of the Lord abideth for ever.” Thus the occurrence in our passage,
if it really took place, was not second in point of the power it exhibits to any even of
the most marvellous works Christ wrought, and claimed no less by its divine character the
faith of the beholders. One may show it to be a greater work than that done at Cana of Galilee
in the turning of water into wine; for in that case it was only soulless matter that was changed,
but here it was the soul and will of thousands of men. It is, however, to be observed that at
the marriage the mother of Jesus is said to be there, and Jesus to have been invited and His
disciples, but that no one but Jesus is said to have descended to Capernaum. His disciples,
however, appear afterwards as present with Him; they remembered that “the zeal of thine
house shall devour me.” And perhaps Jesus was in each of the disciples as He ascended to
Jerusalem, whence it is not said, Jesus went up to “Jerusalem and His disciples,” but He went
down to Capernaum, “He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples.”</p>

<head>17. Matthew’s Story of the Entry into Jerusalem. Difficulties Involved in It for Those
Who Take It Literally.</head>
<p>We have now to take into consideration the statements of the other Gospels on the expulsion
from the temple of those who made it a house of merchandise. Take in the first
place what we find in Matthew. On the Lord’s entering Jerusalem, he says,5063 “All the city
was stirred, saying, Who is this?” But before this he has the story of the ass and the foal
which were taken by command of the Lord and found by the two disciples whom he sent
from Bethphage into the village over against them. These two disciples loose the ass which
was tied, and they have orders, if any one says anything to them, to answer that “the Lord
has need of them; and immediately he will send them.” By these incidents Matthew declares
that the prophecy was fulfilled which says, “Behold, the King cometh, meek and sitting on
an ass and a colt the foal of an ass,” which we find in Zechariah.5064 When, then, the disciples
went and did as Jesus commanded them, they brought the ass and the colt, and placed on
them, he says, their own garments, and the Lord sat upon them, clearly on the ass and the
colt. Then “the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way, and others cut
down branches from the trees and strewed them in the way, and the multitudes that went
before and that followed cried, Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is He that cometh in
the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.” Hence it was that when He entered Jerusalem,
the whole city was moved, saying, Who is this? “and the multitudes said,” those obviously
who went before Him and who followed Him, to those who were asking who He was,
“This is the prophet Jesus of Nazareth of Galilee. And Jesus entered into the temple and
cast out all those that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers
and the seats of them that sold doves: and He saith unto them, It is written, My
house shall be called a house of prayer; but ye make it a den of robbers.” Let us ask those
who consider that Matthew had nothing but the history in his mind when he wrote his
Gospel, what necessity there was for two of the disciples to be sent to the village over against
Bethphage, to find an ass tied and its colt with it and to loose them and bring them? And
how did it deserve to be recorded that He sat upon the ass and the foal and entered into the
city? And how does Zechariah prophesy about Christ when he says,5065 “Rejoice greatly,
thou daughter of Zion, proclaim it, thou daughter of Jerusalem. Behold thy king cometh
unto thee, just is He and bringing salvation, meek and sitting on an ass and a young foal”?
If it be the case that this prophecy predicts simply the material incident described by the
Evangelists, how can those who stand on the letter maintain that this is so with regard to
the following part also of the prophecy, which runs: “And He shall destroy chariots from

Matthew's Story of the Entry into Jerusalem. Difficulties Involved in It…
Ephraim and horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of the warrior shall be destroyed, and a
multitude and peace from the Gentiles, and He shall rule over the waters as far as the sea,
and the rivers to the ends of the earth,” etc. It is to be noted, too, that Matthew does not
give the words as they are found in the prophet, for instead of “Rejoice greatly, thou
daughter of Zion, proclaim it, thou daughter of Jerusalem,” he makes it, “Tell ye the
daughter of Zion.” He curtails the prophetic utterance by omitting the words, “Just is He
and bringing salvation,” then he gives, “meek and sitting,” as in the original, but instead of
“on an ass and a young colt,” he gives, “on an ass and a colt the foal of an ass.” The Jews,
examining into the application of the prophecy to what is recorded about Jesus, press us in
a way we cannot overlook with the enquiry how Jesus destroyed chariots out of Ephraim
and horse from Jerusalem, and how He destroyed the bow of the enemy and did the other
deeds mentioned in the passage. So much with regard to the prophecy. Our literal interpreters,
however, if there is nothing worthy of the appearance of the Son of God in the ass
and the foal, may perhaps point to the length of the road for an explanation. But, in the
first place, fifteen stades are not a great distance and afford no reasonable explanation of
the matter, and, in the second place, they would have to tell us how two beasts of burden
were needed for so short a journey; “He sat,” it is said, “on them.” And then the words: “If
any man say aught unto you, say ye that the Lord hath need of them, and straightway he
will send them.” It does not appear to me to be worthy of the greatness of the Son’s divinity
to say that such a nature as His confessed that it had need of an ass to be loosed from its
bonds and of a foal to come with it; for everything the Son of God has need of should be
great and worthy of His goodness. And then the very great multitude strewing their garments
in the way, while Jesus allows them to do so and does not rebuke them, as is clear from the
words used in another passage,5066 “If these should hold their peace, the stones will cry
out.” I do not know if it does not indicate a certain degree of stupidity on the part of the
writer to take delight in such things, if nothing more is meant by them than what lies on
the surface. And the branches being cut down from the trees and strewn on the road where
the asses go by, surely they are rather a hindrance to Him who is the centre of the throng
than a well-devised reception of Him. The difficulties which met us on the part of those
who were cast out of the temple by Jesus meet us here in a still greater degree. In the Gospel
of John He casts out those who bought, but Matthew says that He cast out those who sold
and those who bought in the temple. And the buyers would naturally be more numerous
than the sellers. We have to consider if the casting out of buyers and sellers in the temple
was not out of keeping with the reputation of one who was thought to be the Son of a carpenter,
unless, as we said before, it was by a divine power that He subjected them. The
words addressed to them, too, are harsher in the other Evangelists than in John. For John
<note type="footnote">5066 Luke xix. 40.</note>

<pb n="762"/>
says that Jesus said to them, “Make not My Father’s house a house of merchandise,” while
in the others they are rebuked for making the house of prayer a den of robbers. Now the
house of His Father did not admit of being turned into a den of robbers, though by the acts
of sinful men it was brought to be a house of merchandise. It was not only the house of
prayer, but in fact the house of God, and by force of human neglect it harboured robbers,
and was turned not only into their house but their den—a thing which no skill, either of
architecture or of reason, could make it.</p>

<head>18. The Ass and the Colt are the Old and the New Testament. Spiritual Meaning
of the Various Features of the Story. Differences Between John’s Narrative and
that of the Other Evangelists.</head>
<p>Now to see into the real truth of these matters is the part of that true intelligence which
is given to those who can say,5067 “But we have the mind of Christ that we may see those
things which are freely given to us of God;” and doubtless it is beyond our powers. For
neither is the ruling principle in our soul free from agitation, nor are our eyes such as those
of the fair bride of Christ should be, of which the bridegroom says,5068 “Thy eyes are doves,”
signifying, perhaps, in a riddle, the observant power which dwells in the spiritual, because
the Holy Spirit came like a dove to our Lord and to the lord in every one. Such as we are,
however, we will not delay, but will feel about the words of life which have been spoken to
us and strive to lay hold of that power in them which flows to him who touches them in
faith. Now Jesus is the word of God which goes into the soul that is called Jerusalem, riding
on the ass freed by the disciples from its bonds. That is to say, on the simple language of
the Old Testament, interpreted by the two disciples who loose it: in the first place him who
applies what is written to the service of the soul and shows the allegorical sense of it with
reference to her, and in the second place him who brings to light by the things which lie in
shadow the good and true things of the future. But He also rides on the young colt, the New
Testament; for in both alike we find the word of truth which purifies us and drives away all
those thoughts in us which incline to selling and buying. But He does not come alone to
Jerusalem, the soul, nor only with a few companions; for many things have to enter into us
before the word of God which makes us perfect, and as many things have to come after Him,
all, however, hymning and glorifying Him and placing under Him their ornaments and
vestures, so that the beasts He rides on may not touch the ground, when He who descended
out of heaven is seated on them. But that His bearers, the old and the new words of Scripture,
may be raised yet higher above the ground, branches have to be cut down from the trees
that they may tread on reasonable expositions. But the multitudes which go before and
follow Him may also signify the angelic ministrations, some of which prepare the way for
Him in our souls, and help in their adorning, while some come after His presence in us, of
which we have often spoken, so that we need not now adduce testimonies about it. And
perhaps it is not without reason that I have likened to an ass the surrounding voices which
conduct the Word Himself to the soul; for it is a beast of burden, and many are the burdens,
heavy the loads, which are brought into view from the text, especially of the Old Testament,
as he can clearly see who observes what is done in this connection on the part of the Jews.
But the foal is not a beast of burden in the same way as the ass. For though every lead of
<note type="footnote">5067 1 Cor. ii. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">5068 Song of Sol. i. 15.</note>

<pb n="764"/>
the latter be heavy to those who have not in themselves the upbearing and most lightening
power of the Spirit, yet the new word is less heavy than the old. I know some who interpret
the tied-up ass as being believers from the circumcision, who are freed from many bonds
by those who are truly and spiritually instructed in the word; and the foal they take to be
those from the Gentiles, who before they receive the word of Jesus are free from any control
and subject to no yoke in their unbridled and pleasure-loving existence. The writers I am
speaking of do not say who those are that go before and who those follow after; but there
would be no absurdity in saying that those who went before were like Moses and the
prophets, and those who followed after the holy Apostles. To what Jerusalem all these go
in it is now our business to enquire, and what is the house which has many sellers and
buyers to be driven out by the Son of God. And perhaps the Jerusalem above to which the
Lord is to ascend driving like a charioteer those of the circumcision and the believers of the
Gentiles, while prophets and Apostles go before Him and follow after Him (or is it the angels
who minister to Him, for they too may be meant by those who go before and those who
follow), perhaps it is that city which before He ascended to it contained the so-called5069
“spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly places,” or the Canaanites and Hittites and
Amorites and the other enemies of the people of God, and in a word, the foreigners. For
in that region, too, it was possible for the prophecy to be fulfilled which says,5070 “Your
country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire, your land, strangers devour it in your
presence.” For these are they who defile and turn into a den of robbers, that is, of themselves
the heavenly house of the Father, the holy Jerusalem, the house of prayer; having spurious
money, and giving pence and small change, cheap worthless coinage, to all who come to
them. These are they who, contending with the souls, take from them what is most precious,
robbing them of their better part to return to them what is worth nothing. But the disciples
go and find the ass tied and loose it, for it cannot have Jesus on account of the covering that
is laid upon it by the law.5071 And the colt is found with it, both having been lost till Jesus
came; I mean, namely, those of the circumcision and those of the Gentiles who afterwards
believed. But how these are sent back again after Jesus has ascended to Jerusalem seated
upon them, it is somewhat dangerous to say; for there is something mystical about it, in
connection with the change of saints into angels. After that change they will be sent back,
in the age succeeding this one, like the ministering spirits,5072 who are sent to do service
for the sake of them who will thereby inherit salvation. But if the ass and the foal are the
old and the new Scriptures, on which the Word of God rides, it is easy to see how, after the

Word has appeared in them, they are sent back and do not wait after the Word has entered
Jerusalem among those who have cast out all the thoughts of selling and buying. I consider,
too, that it is not without significance that the place where the ass was found tied, and the
foal, was a village, and a village without a name. For in comparison with the great world in
heaven, the whole earth is a village where the ass is found tied and the colt, and it is simply
called “the village” without any other designation being added to it. From Bethphage Matthew
says the disciples are sent out who are to fetch the ass and the colt; and Bethphage is
a priestly place, the name of which means “House of Jaw-bones.” So much we have said, as
our power allowed, on the text of Matthew, reserving for a further opportunity, when we
may be permitted to take up the Gospel of Matthew by itself, a more complete and accurate
discussion of his statements. Mark and Luke say that the two disciples, acting on their
Master’s instructions, found a foal tied, on which no one had ever sat, and that they loosed
it and brought it to the Lord. Mark adds that they found the foal tied at the door, outside
on the road. But who is outside? Those of the Gentiles who were strangers5073 from the
covenants, and aliens to the promise of God; they are on the road, not resting under a roof
or a house, bound by their own sins, and to be loosed by the twofold knowledge spoken of
above, of the friends of Jesus. And the bonds with which the foal was tied, and the sins
committed against the wholesome law and reproved by it,—for it is the gate of life,—in respect
of it, I say, they were not inside but outside the door, for perhaps inside the door there
cannot be any such bond of wickedness. But there were some persons standing beside the
tied-up foal, as Mark says; those, I suppose, who had tied it; as Luke records, it was the
masters of the foal who said to the disciples, Why loose ye the foal? For those lords who
subjected and bound the sinner are illegal masters and cannot look the true master in the
face when he frees the foal from its bonds. Thus when the disciples say, “The Lord hath
need of him,” these wicked masters have nothing to say in reply. The disciples then bring
the foal to Jesus naked, and put their own dress on it, so that the Lord may sit on the disciples’
garments which are on it, at His ease. What is said further will not, in the light of Matthew’s
statements, present any difficulty; how5074 “They come to Jerusalem, and entering into the
temple He began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple,” or how5075 “When
He drew nigh and beheld the city He wept over it; and entering into the temple He began
to cast out them that sold.” For in some of those who have the temple in themselves He
casts out all that sell and buy in the temple; but in others who do not quite obey the word
of God, He only makes a beginning of casting out the sellers and buyers. There is a third
class also besides these, in which He began to cast out the sellers only, and not also the

buyers. With John, on the contrary, they are all cast out by the scourge woven of small
cords, along with the sheep and the oxen. It should be carefully considered whether it is
possible that the changes of the things described and the discrepancies found in them can
be satisfactorily solved by the anagogic method. Each of the Evangelists ascribes to the
Word different modes of action, which produce in souls of different tempers not the same
effects but yet similar ones. The discrepancy we noticed in respect of Jesus’ journeys to
Jerusalem, which the Gospel now in hand reports quite differently from the other three, as
we have expounded their words, cannot be made good in any other way. John gives statements
which are similar to those of the other three but not the same; instead of branches
cut from the trees or stubble brought from the fields and strewed on the road he says they
took branches of palm trees. He says that much people had come to the feast, and that these
went out to meet Him, crying, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,” and
“Blessed is the King of Israel.” He also says that it was Jesus Himself who found the young
ass on which Christ sat, and the phrase, young ass, doubtless conveys some additional
meaning, as the small animal afforded a benefit not of men, nor through men, but through
Jesus Christ. John moreover does not, any more than the others, reproduce the prophetic
words exactly; instead of them he gives us “Fear not, O daughter of Zion; behold thy King
cometh sitting” (instead of “mounted”) “on the foal of an ass” (for “on an ass and a young
foal”). The words “Fear not, daughter of Zion,” are not in the prophet at all. But as the
prophetic utterance has been applied by all in this way, let us see if there was not a necessity
that the daughter of Zion should rejoice greatly and that the greater than she, the daughter
of Jerusalem, should not only rejoice greatly but should also proclaim it when her king was
coming to her, just and bringing salvation, and meek, having mounted an ass and a young
colt. Whoever, then, receives Him will no longer be afraid of those who are armed with the
specious discourses of the heterodox, those chariots of Ephraim said to be destroyed by the
Lord,5076 nor the horse, the vain thing for safety,5077 that is the mad desire which has accustomed
itself to the things of sense and which is injurious to many of those who desire to
dwell in Jerusalem and to attend to the sound word. It is also fitting to rejoice at the destruction
by Him who rides on the ass and the young foal of every hostile dart, since the fiery
darts of the enemy are no longer to prevail over him who has received Jesus to his own
temple. And there will also be a multitude from the Gentiles with peace5078 at the Saviour’s
coming to Jerusalem, when He rules over the waters that He may bruise the head of the
dragon on the water,5079 and we shall tread upon the waves of the sea and to the mouths of

all the rivers on the earth. Mark, however, writing about the foal,5080 reports the Lord to
have said, “On which never man sat;” and he seems to me to hint at the circumstance that
those who afterwards believed had never submitted to the Word before Jesus’ coming to
them. For of men, perhaps, no one had ever sate on the foal, but of hearts or of powers alien
to the Word some had sate on it, since in the prophet Isaiah the wealth of opposing powers
is said to be borne on asses and camels.5081 “In the distress and the affliction,” he writes,
“the lion and the lion’s whelp, whence also the offspring of flying asps, who carried their
riches on asses and camels.” The question occurs again, for those who have no mind but
for the bare words, if according to their view the words, “on which never man sat,” are not
quite meaningless. For who but a man ever sits on a foal? So much of our views.</p>

<head>19. Various Views of Heracleon on Purging of the Temple.</head>
<p>Let us see what Heracleon makes of this. He says that the ascent to Jerusalem signifies
the Lord’s going up from material things to the spiritual place, which is a likeness of Jerusalem.
And he considers that the words are, “He found in the temple,” and not “in the
sanctuary,”5082 because the Lord is not to be understood as instrumental in that call only,
which takes place where the spirit is not. He considers the temple to be the Holy of Holies,
into which none but the High-Priest enters, and there I believe he says that the spiritual go;
while the court of the temple, where the levites also enter, is a symbol of these psychical
ones who are saved, but outside the Pleroma. Then those who are found in the temple
selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting, he took to represent
those who attribute nothing to grace, but regard the entrance of strangers to the temple as
a matter of merchandise and gain, and who minister the sacrifices for the worship of God,
with a view to their own gain and love of money. And the scourge which Jesus made of
small cords and did not receive from another, he expounds in a way of his own, saying that
the scourge is an image of the power and energy of the Holy Spirit, driving out by His breath
those who are bad. And he declares that the scourge and the linen and the napkin and
other things of such a kind are symbolic of the power and energy of the Holy Spirit. Then
he assumes what is not written, as that the scourge was tied to a piece of wood, and this
wood he takes to be a type of the cross; on this wood the gamblers, merchants, and all evil
was nailed up and done away. In searching into the act of Jesus, and discussing the composition
of the scourge out of two substances, he romances in an extraordinary way; He did
not make it, he says, of dead leather. He wished to make the Church no longer a den of
robbers, but the house of His Father. We must here say what is most necessary on the divinity,
as referred to in Heracleon’s text. If Jesus calls the temple at Jerusalem the house of
His Father, and that temple was made in honour of Him who made heaven and earth, why
are we not at once told that He is the Son of no one else than the Maker of heaven and earth,
that He is the Son of God? To this house of the Father of Jesus, as being the house of prayer,
the Apostles of Christ also, as we find in their “Acts,” are told5083 by the angel to go and to
stand there and preach all the words of this life. But they came to the house of prayer,
through the Beautiful Gate, to pray there, a thing they would not have done had they not
known Him to be the same with the God worshipped by those who had dedicated that
temple. Hence, too, they say, those who obeyed God rather than men, Peter and the Apostles,
<note type="footnote">5082 ἐν τῶ ἱερῷ, not τῷ ναῷ. The latter is Neander’s correction for τῶν ἄνω, “the things above.” Heracleon’s
point is that the ἰερόν, the Holy of Holies, represents the spiritual realm; and that Jesus entered it as being, as
well as the ναος, in need of His saving work.</note>

<pb n="769"/>
“The God5084 of our Fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging Him on a tree;” for
they know that by no other God was Jesus raised from the dead but the God of the fathers,
whom Jesus also extols as the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, who are not dead but
living. How, too, could the disciples, if the house was not that of the same God with the
God of Christ, have remembered the saying in the sixty-ninth Psalm, “The zeal of thy house
shall devour Me;” for thus it is found in the prophet, and not “hath devoured Me.” Now
Christ is zealous principally for that house of God which is in each of us; He does not wish
that it should be a house of merchandise, nor that the house of prayer should be a den of
robbers; for He is the Son of a jealous God. We ought to give a liberal interpretation to such
utterances of Scripture; they speak of human things, but in the way of metaphor, to show
that God desires that nothing foreign should be mixed up with His will in the soul of all
men, indeed, but principally of those who are minded to accept the message of our most
divine faith. But we must remember that the sixty-ninth Psalm, which contains the words,
“The zeal of thy house shall devour me,” and a little further on, “They gave Me gall for My
drink and for My thirst they gave Me vinegar,” both texts being recorded in the Gospels,
that that Psalm is spoken in the person of the Christ, and nowhere shows any change of
person. It shows a great want of observation on Heracleon’s part that he considers the
words, “The zeal of thy house shall devour Me,” to be spoken in the person of those powers
which were cast out and destroyed by the Saviour; he fails to see the connection of the
prophecy in the Psalm. For if these words are understood as spoken by the expelled and
destroyed powers, it follows that he must take the words, “They gave Me vinegar to drink,”
which are a part of the same psalm, to be also spoken by those powers. What misled him
was probably that he could not understand how the “shall devour Me” could be spoken by
Christ, since He did not appreciate the way in which anthropopathic statements are applied
to God and to Christ.</p>

<head>20. The Temple Which Christ Says He Will Raise Up is the Church. How the Dry
Bones Will Be Made to Live Again.</head>
<p>“The Jews then answered and said unto Him, What sign showest Thou unto us, seeing
that Thou doest these things?5085 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple,
and in three days I will raise it up.” Those of the body, and those who incline to material
things, seem to me to be meant by the Jews, who, after Jesus has driven out those who make
God’s house a house of merchandise, are angry at Him for treating these matters in such a
way, and demand a sign, a sign which will show that the Word, whom they do not receive,
has a right to do such things. The Saviour joins on to His statement about the temple a
statement which is really one with the former, about His own body, and to the question,
What sign doest Thou, seeing that Thou doest such things? answers, “Destroy this temple,
and in three days I will raise it up.” He could have exhibited a thousand other signs, but to
the question, “Seeing that Thou doest such things,” He could not answer anything else; He
fittingly gave the answer about the sign connected with the temple, and not about signs
unconnected with the temple. Now, both of these two things, the temple and the body of
Jesus, appear to me, in one interpretation at least, to be types of the Church, and to signify
that it is built of living stones,5086 a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, built5087 on the
foundation of the Apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus being the head corner-stone; and it
is, therefore, called a temple. Now, from the text,5088 “Ye are the body of Christ, and
members each in his part,” we see that even though the harmonious fitting of the stones of
the temple appear to be dissolved and scattered, as it is written in the twenty-second
Psalm5089 that all the bones of Christ are, by the plots made against it in persecutions and
afflictions, on the part of those who war against the unity of the temple in persecutions, yet
the temple will be raised again, and the body will rise again on the third day after the day
of evil which threatens it,5090 and the day of consummation which follows. For the third
day will rise on the new heaven and the new earth, when these bones, the whole house of
Israel,5091 will rise in the great Lord’s day, death having been overcome. And thus the re-

surrection of the Saviour from the passion of the cross contains the mystery of the resurrection
of the whole body of Christ. But as that material body of Jesus was sacrificed for Christ,
and was buried, and was afterwards raised, so the whole body of Christ’s saints is crucified
along with Him, and now lives no longer; for each of them, like Paul, glories5092 in nothing
but the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which He is crucified to the world, and the
world to Him. Not only, therefore, is it crucified with Christ, and crucified to the world; it
is also buried with Christ, for we were buried with Christ, Paul says.5093 And then he says,
as if enjoying some earnest of the resurrection, “We rose with Him,”5094 because He walks
in a certain newness of life, though not yet risen in that blessed and perfect resurrection
which is hoped for. Either, then, he is now crucified, and afterwards is buried, or he is now
buried and taken down from the cross, and, being now buried, is to rise at some future time.
But to most of us the mystery of the resurrection is a great one, and difficult of contemplation;
it is spoken of in many other passages of Scripture, and is specially announced in the following
passage of Ezekiel:5095 “And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and He led me out in the
Spirit of the Lord, and set me in the midst of the plain, and it was full of human bones. And
He led me round about them in a circle, and behold there were very many on the face of
the plain, and behold they were very dry. And He said to me, Son of man, shall these bones
live? And I said, Lord, Lord, Thou knowest. And He said to me, Prophesy to these bones,
and thou shalt say to them, Hear the word of the Lord, ye dry bones;” and a little further
on, “And the Lord spake to me, saying, Son of man, these bones are the house of Israel.
And they say, Our bones are become dry, our hope is lost, we have breathed our last.” For
what bones are these which are addressed, “Hear ye the word of the Lord,” as if they heard
the word of the Lord? They belong to the house of Israel, or to the body of Christ, of which
the Lord says,5096 “All My bones are scattered,” although the bones of His body were not
scattered, and not even one of them was broken. But when the resurrection itself takes place
of the true and more perfect body of Christ, then those who are now the members of Christ,
for they will then be dry bones, will be brought together, bone to bone, and fitting to fitting
(for none of those who are destitute of fitting (ἁρμονία) will come to the perfect man), to
the measure5097 of the stature of the fulness of the body of Christ. And then the many
members5098 will be the one body, all of them, though many, becoming members of one

body. But it belongs to God alone to make the distinction of foot and hand and eye and
hearing and smelling, which in one sense fill up the head, but in another the feet and the
rest of the members, and the weaker and humbler ones, the more and the less honourable.
God will temper the body together, and then, rather than now, He will give to that which
lacks the more abundant honour, that there may be, by no means, any schism in the body,
but that the members may have the same care for one another, and, if any member be well
off, all the members may share in its good things, or if any member be glorified, all the

<head>21. That the Son Was Raised Up by the Father. The Charge Brought Against Jesus
at His Trial Was Based on the Incident Now Before Us.</head>
<p>What I have said is not alien to the passage now engaging us, dealing as it does with the
temple and those cast out from it, of which the Saviour says, “The zeal of thy house shall
devour Me;” and with the Jews who asked that a sign should be showed them, and the Saviour’s
answer to them, in which He combines the discourse on the temple with that on His
own body, and says, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.” For from this
temple, which is the body of Christ, everything that is irrational and savours of merchandise
must be driven away, that it may no longer be a house of merchandise. And this temple
must be destroyed by those who plot against the Word of God, and after its destruction be
raised again on that third day which we discussed above; when the disciples also will remember
what He, the Word, said before the temple of God was destroyed, and will believe, not
only their knowledge but their faith also being then made perfect, and that by the word
which Jesus spoke. And every one who is of this nature, Jesus purifying him,5099 puts away
things that are irrational and things that savour of selling, to be destroyed on account of the
zeal of the Logos that is in Him. But they are destroyed to be raised again by Jesus, not on
the third day, if we attend to the exact words before us, but “in three days.” For the rising
again of the temple takes place on the first day after it has been destroyed and on the second
day, and its resurrection is accomplished in all the three days. Hence a resurrection both
has been and is to be, if indeed we were buried with Christ, and rose with Him. And since
the word, “We rose with Him,” does not cover the whole of the resurrection, “in Christ shall
all be made alive,5100 but every one in his own order, Christ the first fruits, then they that
are Christ’s at His coming, and then the end.” It belongs to the resurrection that one should
be on the first day in the paradise of God,5101 and it belongs to the resurrection when Jesus
appears and says, “Touch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father,”5102 but the
perfection of the resurrection was when He came to the Father. Now there are some who
fall into confusion on this head of the Father and the Son, and we must devote a few words
to them. They quote the text,5103 “Yea, and we are found false witnesses for God, because
we testified against God that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up,” and other similar
texts which show the raiser-up to be another person than He who was raised up; and
the text, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,” as if it resulted from these
that the Son did not differ in number from the Father, but that both were one, not only in

point of substance but in point of subject, and that the Father and the Son were said to be
different in some of their aspects but not in their hypostases. Against such views we must
in the first place adduce the leading texts which prove the Son to be another than the Father,
and that the Son must of necessity be the son of a Father, and the Father, the father of a
Son. Then we may very properly refer to Christ’s declaration that He cannot do anything
but what He sees the Father doing and saying,5104 because whatever the Father does that
the Son also does in like manner, and that He had raised the dead, i.e., the body, the Father
granting Him this, who must be said to have been the principal agent in raising up Christ
from the dead. But Heracleon says, “In three days,” instead of “On the third day,” not having
examined the point (and yet having noted the words “in three”), that the resurrection is
brought about in three days. But he also calls the third the spiritual day, in which they
consider the resurrection of the Church to be indicated. It follows from this that the first
day is to be called the “earthly” day, and the second the psychical, the resurrection of the
Church not having taken place on them. Now the statements of the false witnesses, recorded
in the Gospel according to Matthew and Mark5105 towards the end of the Gospel, and the
accusation they brought against our Lord Jesus Christ, appear to have reference to this utterance
of His, “Destroy this temple, and I will build it up in three days.” For He was
speaking of the temple of His body, but they supposed His words to refer to the temple of
stone, and so they said when accusing Him, “This man said, I am able to destroy the temple
of God and to build it up in three days,” or, as Mark has it, “We heard Him say, that I will
destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build up another temple not
made with hands.” Here the high-priest stood up and said to Him, “Answerest Thou
nothing? What do these witness against Thee? But Jesus held His peace.” Or, as Mark says,
“And the high-priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus saying, Answerest Thou nothing?
What do these witness against Thee? But He held His peace and answered nothing.” These
words must, I think, necessarily have reference to the text now before us.</p>

<head>22. The Temple of Solomon Did Not Take Forty-Six Years to Build. With Regard
to that of Ezra We Cannot Tell How Long It Took. Significance of the Number
Forty-Six.</head>
<p>The Jews therefore said, “Forty and six years was this temple in building,5106 and wilt
thou raise it up in three days?” How the Jews said that the temple had been forty-six years
building, we cannot tell, if we adhere to the history. For it is written in the third Book of
Kings,5107 that they prepared the stones and the wood three years, and in the fourth year,
in the second month,5108 when Solomon was king over Israel, the king commanded, and
they brought great precious stones for the foundation of the house, and unhewn stones.
And the sons of Solomon and the sons of Hiram hewed the stones and laid them in the
fourth year, and they founded the house of the Lord in the month Nisan and the second
month: in the tenth year in the month Baal, which was the eighth month, the house was
finished according to the whole count and the whole plan of it. Thus comparing the time
of its completion with the period of building, the building of it occupies less than eleven
years. How, then, do the Jews come to say that the temple was forty-six years in building?
One might, indeed, do violence to the words and make out the period of forty-six years at
all costs, by counting from the time when David, after planning about the building of the
temple, said to Nathan the prophet,5109 “Behold I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of
God dwelleth in the midst of the tent,” for though it is true that he was prevented, as being
a man of blood,5110 from carrying out the building, he seems to have busied himself in collecting
materials for it. In the first Book of Chronicles,5111 certainly, David the king says
to all the congregation, “Solomon my son, whom the Lord hath chosen, is young and tender,
and the work is great, because he is not to build for man but for the Lord God. According
to my whole power I have prepared for the house of my God, gold, silver, brass, and iron,
wood, stones of Soom, and stones for filling up, and precious stones of many kinds, and all
sorts of precious wood, and a large quantity of Parian marble. And besides this, for the
pleasure I have taken in the house of my God, the gold and the silver I possess, lo, I have
given it for the house of my Lord, to the full; from such supplies5112 I prepared for the house
of the saints, three thousand talents of gold from Suphir, and seven thousand talents of

stamped silver. that the houses of God may be overlaid with them by the hands of artificers.”
For David reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem;5113 so that if
it could be shown that the beginning of the preparations for the temple and of David’s collecting
the necessary material, was in the fifth year of his reign, then, with some forcing, the
statement about forty-six years might stand. But some one else will say that the temple
spoken of was not that built by Solomon, for that it was destroyed at the period of the captivity,
but the temple built at the time of Ezra,5114 with regard to which the forty-six years
can be shown to be quite accurate. But in this Maccabean period things were very unsettled
with regard to the people and the temple, and I do not know if the temple was really built
in that number of years. Heracleon pays no attention to the history, but says that in that he
was forty-six years preparing the temple, Solomon was an image of the Saviour. The number
six he connects with matter, that is, the image, and the number forty, which he says is the

<head>23. The Temple Spoken of by Christ is the Church. Application to the Church of
the Statements Regarding the Building of Solomon’s Temple, and the Numbers
Stated in that Narrative.</head>
<p>“But He spake of the temple of His body.5116 When, therefore, He was raised from the
dead, His disciples remembered that He said this, and they believed the Scripture and the
word which Jesus had said.” This refers to the statement that the body of the Son is His
temple. It may be asked whether this is to be taken in its plain sense, or whether we should
try to connect each statement that is recorded about the temple, with the view we take about
the body of Jesus, whether the body which He received from the Virgin, or that body of
Christ which the Church is said to be, as we are said by the Apostle5117 to be all members
of His body. One may, on the one hand, suppose it to be hopeless to get everything that is
said about the temple properly connected with the body, in whatever sense the body be
taken, and one may have recourse to a simpler explanation, and say that the body (in either
of these senses) is called the temple, because as the temple had the glory of God dwelling in
it, so He who was the image and glory of God, the first-born of every creature, could rightly
be called, in respect of His body or the Church, the temple containing the image. We, for
our part, see it to be a hard task to expound every particular of what is said about the temple
in the third Book of Kings, and far beyond our powers of language, and we defer it in the
meantime, as a thing beyond the scale of the present work. We also have a strong conviction
that in such matters, which transcend human nature, it must be the work of divine wisdom
to make plain the meaning of inspired Scripture, of that wisdom which is hidden in a mystery,
which none of the rulers of this world knew. We are well aware, too, that we need the assistance
of that excellent Spirit of wisdom, in order to understand such matters, as they should
be understood by ministers of sacred things; and in this connection we will attempt to describe,
as shortly as we may, our view of what belongs to this subject. The body is the Church,
and we learn from Peter5118 that it is a house of God, built of living stones, a spiritual house
for a holy priesthood. Thus the son of David, who builds this house, is a type of Christ. He
builds it when his wars are at an end,5119 and a period of profound peace has arrived; he
builds the temple for the glory of God in the Jerusalem on earth, so that worship may no
longer be celebrated in a moveable erection like the tabernacle. Let us seek to find in the
Church the truth of each statement made about the temple. If all Christ’s enemies are made
the footstool of His feet,5120 and Death, the last enemy, is destroyed, then there will be the

most perfect peace. Christ will be Solomon, which means “Peaceful,”5121 and the prophecy
will find its fulfilment in Him, which says,5122 “With those who hated peace I was peaceful.”
And then each of the living stones will be, according to the work of his life here, a stone of
that temple, one, at the foundation, an apostle or a prophet, bearing those placed upon him,
and another, after those in the foundation, and supported by the Apostles, will himself, with
the Apostles, help to bear those in more need. One will be a stone of the inmost parts, where
the ark is, and the cherubim, and the mercy-seat; another will be on the outer wall, and another
even outside the outer wall of the levites and priests, a stone of the altar of whole burnt
offerings. And the management and service of these things will be entrusted to holy powers,
angels of God, being, respectively, lordships, thrones, dominions, or powers; and there will
be others subject to these, typified by three thousand six hundred5123 chief officers, who
were appointed over the works of Solomon, and the seventy thousand of those who bore
burdens, and the eighty thousand stone-cutters in the mountain, who wrought in the work,
and prepared the stones and the wood. It is to be remarked that those reported as bearing
burdens are related to the Hebdomad. The quarrymen and stone-cutters, who make the
stones fitted for the temple, have some kinship to the ogdoad. And the officers, who are six
hundred in number, are connected with the perfect number six multiplied into itself. The
preparation of the stones, as they are taken out and fitted for the building, extends over
three years; this appears to me to point solely to the time of the eternal interval which is
akin to the triad. This will come to pass when peace is consummated after the number of
years of the transaction of the matters connected with the exodus from Egypt, namely, three
hundred and forty, and of what took place in Egypt four hundred and thirty years after the
covenant made by God with Abraham. Thus, from Abraham to the beginning of the
building of the temple, there are two sabbatic numbers, the 700 and the 70; and at that time,
too, our King Christ will command the seventy thousand burden-bearers not to take any
chance stones for the foundation of the temple, but great stones, precious, unhewn, that
they may be hewn, not by any chance workmen, but by the sons of Solomon; for so we find
it written in the third Book of Kings. Then, too, on account of the profound peace, Hiram,
king of Tyre, cooperates in the building of the temple, and gives his own sons to the sons
of Solomon, to hew, in company with them, the great and precious stones for the holy place,
which, in the fourth year, are placed in the foundation of the house of the Lord. But in an
ogdoad of years the house is finished in the eighth month of the eighth year after its
foundation.</p>

<head>24. The Account of the Building of Solomon’s Temple Contains Serious Difficulties
and is to Be Interpreted Spiritually.</head>
<p>For the sake of those, however, who consider that nothing further than the narrative
itself is meant to be indicated in these words, it may not be unfitting to introduce at this
point some considerations which they can scarcely withstand, to show that the words ought
to be regarded as those of the Spirit, and that the mind of the Spirit should be sought for in
them. Did the sons of the kings really spend their time in hewing the great and precious
stones, and practise a craft so little in keeping with royal birth? And the number of the
burden-bearers and of the stone-cutters and of the officers, the duration, too, of the period
of preparing the stones and marking them, is all this recorded as it really was? The holy
house, too, was got ready in peace and was to be built for God without hammer or axe or
any iron tool, that there might be no disturbance in the house of God. And again I would
ask those who are in bondage to the letter how it is possible that there should be eighty
thousand stone-cutters and that the house of God should be built out of hard white stones
without the noise of hammer or axe or any iron tool being heard in His house while the
building was going on? Is it not living stones that are hewn without any noise or tumult
somewhere outside the temple, so that they are brought ready prepared to the place which
awaits them in the building? And there is some sort of an ascent about the temple of God,
not with angles, but with bends of straight lines. For it is written,5124 “And there was a
winding staircase to the middle, and from the middle to the third floor;” for the staircase in
the house of God had to be spiral, thus imitating in its ascent the circle, which is the most
perfect figure. But that this house might be secure five ties are built in it,5125 as fair as possible,
a cubit high, that on looking up one might see it to be suggested how we rise from
sensible things to the so-called divine perceptions, and so be brought to perceive those things
which are seen only by the mind. But the place of the happier stones appears to be that
called Dabir,5126 where the ark of the covenant of the Lord was, and, as I may say, the
handwriting of God, the tables written with His own finger. And the whole house is overlaid
with gold; “the whole house,” we read,5127 “he overlaid with gold until all the house was
finished.” But there were two cherubim in Dabir, a word which the translators of the Hebrew
Bible into Greek failed to render satisfactorily. Some, failing to do justice to the language,
render it the temple; but it is more sacred than the temple. Now everything about the house
was made golden, for a sign that the mind which is quite made perfect estimates accurately
the things perceived by the intellect. But it is not given to all to approach and know them;

<head>25. Further Spiritualizing of Solomon’s Temple-Building.</head>
<p>It is worth while to enquire how, on the one hand, Solomon the king is said to have
built the temple, and on the other the master-builder whom Solomon sent and fetched,5128
“Hiram of Tyre, the son of a woman who was a widow; and he was of the tribe of Naphtali,
and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass, and filled with wisdom and understanding,
to work all works in brass; and he was brought in to King Solomon and wrought all his
works.” Here I ask whether Solomon can be taken for the first-born of all creation,5129 and
Hiram for the man whom he assumed, from the constraint of men—for the word Tyrians
means “constrainers”—the man who derived his birth from nature, and being filled with
all manner of art and wisdom and understanding, was brought in to cooperate with the
first-born of all creation, and to build the temple. In this temple there are also windows,5130
placed obliquely and out of sight, so that the illumination of the divine light may enter for
salvation, and—why should I go into particulars?—that the body of Christ, the Church, may
be found having the plan of the spiritual house and temple of God. As I said before, we require
that wisdom which is hidden in a mystery, and which he alone can apprehend who is
able to say, “But we have the mind of Christ,”—we require that wisdom to interpret spiritually
each detail of what is said in accordance with the will of Him who caused it to be written.
To enter into these details is not in accordance with our present subject. What has been
said may suffice to let us understand how “He spake about the temple of His body.”</p>

<head>26. The Promises Addressed to Jerusalem in the Prophets Refer to the Church, and
are Still to Be Fulfilled.</head>
<p>After all this it is proper to ask whether what is narrated as having taken place about
the temple has ever taken place or ever will take place about the spiritual house. The argument
may seem to pinch in whichever way we take it. If we say that it is possible that
something like what is told about the temple may take place with regard to the spiritual
house, or has already taken place in it, then those who hear us will, with difficulty, be brought
to admit that a change can take place in such good things as these, firstly, because they do
not wish it, and secondly, because of the incongruity of thinking that such things admit of
change. If, on the other hand, We seek to maintain the unchangeableness of the good things
once given to the saints, then we cannot apply to them what we find in the history, and we
shall seem to be doing what those of the heresies do, who fail to maintain the unity of the
narrative of Scripture from beginning to end. If we are not to take the view proper to old
wives or Jews, of the promises recorded in the prophets, and especially in Isaiah, if, that is
to say, we are to look for their fulfilment in connection with the Jerusalem on earth, then,
as certain remarkable things connected with the building of the temple and the restoration
of the people from the captivity are spoken of as happening after the captivity and the destruction
of the temple, we must say that we are now the temple and the people which was
carried captive, but is to come up again to Judæa and Jerusalem, and to be built with the
precious stones of Jerusalem. But I cannot tell if it be possible that, at the revolution of long
periods of time, things of the same nature should take place again, but in a worse way. The
prophecies of Isaiah which we mentioned are the following:5131 “Behold I prepare for thy
stone carbuncle and for thy foundation sapphire; and I will make thy battlements jasper,
and thy gates stones of crystal, and thy outer wall choice stones; and all thy sons shall be
taught of the Lord, and in great peace shall thy children be, and in righteousness shalt thou
be built.” And a little further on, to the same Jerusalem:5132 “And the glory of Lebanon
shall come to thee with cypress, and pine, and cedar, along with those who will glorify My
holy place. And the sons of them that humbled thee and insulted thee shall come to thee
in fear; and thou shalt be called the city of the Lord, Sion of holy Israel, because thou wert
desolate and hated, and there was none to help thee. And I will make thee an eternal delight,
a joy of generations of generations. And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles and shall
eat the riches of kings, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord that saveth thee and the God
of Israel that chooseth thee. And instead of brass I will bring thee gold, and instead of iron
I will bring thee silver, and for wood I will bring thee brass, and for stones iron. And I will
establish thy rulers in peace and thy overseers in righteousness. And wickedness shall no

<pb n="783"/>
more be heard in thy land, nor affliction and distress in thy borders, but thy walls shall be
called salvation and thy gates sculpture. And the sun shall no longer be to thee for light by
day, nor shall the rising of the moon give light to thee by night, but Christ shall be to thee
an everlasting light and thy God thy glory. For thy sun shall no more go down, and thy
moon shall not fail, for thy Lord shall be to thee an everlasting light, and the days of thy
mourning shall be fulfilled.” These prophecies clearly refer to the age still to come, and they
are addressed to the children of Israel in their captivity, to whom He was sent and came,
who said, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”5133 Such things, though
they are captives, they are to receive in their own land; and proselytes also are to come to
them at that time through Christ, and are to fly to them, according to the saying,5134 “Behold,
proselytes shall come to thee through Me, and shall flee to thee for refuge.” And if all this
is to take place with the captives, then it is plain that they must be about their temple, and
that they must go up there again to be built up, having become the most precious of stones.
For we find with John in his Apocalyse,5135 the promise made to him that overcomes, that
he will be a pillar in the temple of God, and will go no more out. All this I have said with a
view to our obtaining a cursory view at least of the matters pertaining to the temple, and
the house of God, and the Church and Jerusalem, which we cannot now take up systematically.
Those, however, who, in their reading of the prophets, do not shrink from the labour
of seeking after their spiritual meaning, must enquire into these matters with the greatest
particularity, and must take account of every possibility. So far of “the temple of His body.”</p>

<head>27. Of the Belief the Disciples Afterwards Attained in the Words of Jesus.</head>
<p>“When He was raised from the dead,5136 His disciples remembered that He spake this,
and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.” This tells us that after
Jesus’ resurrection from the dead His disciples saw that what He had said about the temple
had a higher application to His passion and His resurrection; they remembered that the
words, “In three days I will raise it up,” pointed to the resurrection; “And they believed the
Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.” We are not told that they believed the
Scripture or the word which Jesus said, before. For faith in its full sense is the act of him
who accepts with his whole soul what is professed at baptism. As for the higher sense, as
we have already spoken of the resurrection from the dead of the whole body of the Lord,
we have now to note that the disciples were put in mind by the fulfilment of the Scripture
which when they were in life they had not fully understood; its meaning was now brought
under their eyes and made quite clear to them, and they knew of what heavenly things it
was the pattern and shadow. Then they believed the Scripture who formerly did not believe
it, and believed the word of Jesus which, as the speaker means to convey, they had not believed
before the resurrection. For how can any one be said in the full sense to believe the Scripture
when he does not see in it the mind of the Holy Spirit, which God would have us to believe
rather than the literal meaning? From this point of view we must say that none of those
who walk according to the flesh believe the spiritual things of the law, of the very beginnings
of which they have no conception. But, they say, those are more blessed who have not seen
and yet believe, than those who have seen and have believed, and for this they quote the
saying to Thomas at the end of the Gospel of John,5137 “Blessed are they that have not seen
and yet have believed.” But it is not said here that those who have not seen and yet have
believed are more blessed than those who have seen and believed. According to their view
those after the Apostles are more blessed than the Apostles; than which nothing can be more
foolish. He who is to be blessed must see in his mind the things which he believes, and must
be able with the Apostles to hear the words spoken to him, “Blessed are your eyes, for they
see, and your ears, for they hear,”5138 and “Many prophets and righteous men have desired
to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things which ye hear,
and have not heard them.” Yet he may be content who only receives the inferior beatitude,
which says:5139 “Blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed.” But how much
more blessed are those eyes which Jesus calls blessed for the things which they have seen,
than those which have not attained to such a vision; Simeon is content to take into his arms

the salvation of God, and after seeing it, he says,5140 “Now, O Lord, lettest Thou Thy servant
depart in peace, according to Thy word; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.” We must
strive, therefore, as Solomon says, to open our eyes that we may be satisfied with bread;
“Open thine eyes,” he says, “and be satisfied with bread.” What I have said on the text,
“They believe the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said unto them,” may lead us to
understand, after discussing the subject of faith, that the perfection of our faith will be given
us at the great resurrection from the dead of the whole body of Jesus which is His Holy
Church. For what is said about knowledge, “Now I know in part,”5141 that, I think, may be
said in the same way of every other good; and one of these others is faith. “Now I believe
in part,” we may say, “but when that which is perfect is come, then the faith which is in part
will be done away.” As with knowledge, so with faith, that which is through sight is far
better, if I may say so, than that which is through a glass and in an enigma.</p>

<head>28. The Difference Between Believing in the Name of Jesus and Believing in Jesus
Himself.</head>
<p>“Now, when He was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed in
His name, beholding His signs which He did. But He, Jesus, did not trust Himself to them,
because He knew all (men) and because He needed not that any should testify of man, for
he Himself knew what was in man.”5142 One might ask how Jesus did not Himself believe
in those of whom we are told that they believed. To this we must say it was not those who
believed in Him that Jesus did not trust, but those who believed in His name; for believing
in His name is a different thing from believing in Him. He who will not be judged because
of his faith is exempted from the judgment, not for believing in His name, but for believing
in Him; for the Lord says,5143 “He that believeth in Me is not judged,” not, “He who believes
in My name is not judged;” the latter believes, and hence he is not worthy to be condemned
already, but he is inferior to the other who believes in Him. Hence it is that Jesus does not
trust Himself to him who believes in His name. We must, therefore, cleave to Him rather
than to His name, lest after we have done wonders in His name, we should hear these words
addressed to us which He will speak to those who boast of His name alone.5144 With the
Apostle Paul5145 let us seek joyfully to say, “I can do all things in Christ Jesus strengthening
me.” We have also to notice that in a former passage5146 the Evangelist calls the passover
that of the Jews, while here he does not say that Jesus was at the passover of the Jews, but at
the passover at Jerusalem; and in the former case when the passover is called that of the
Jews, it is not said to be a feast; but here Jesus is recorded to have been at the feast; when at
Jerusalem He was at the passover during the feast, and many believed, even though only in
His name. We ought to notice certainly that “many” are said to believe, not in Him, but in
His name. Now, those who believe in Him are those who walk in the straight and narrow
way,5147 which leads to life, and which is found by few. It may well be, however, that many
of those who believe in His name will sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
kingdom of heaven, the Father’s house, in which are many mansions. And it is to be noted
that the many who believe in His name do not believe in the same way as Andrew does, and
Peter, and Nathanael, and Philip. These believe the testimony of John when he says, “Behold
the Lamb of God,” or they believe in Christ as found by Andrew, or Jesus saying to Philip,
“Follow Me,” or Philip saying, “We have found Him of whom Moses and the prophets did

write, Jesus the Son of Joseph from Nazareth.” Those, on the other hand, of whom we now
speak, “believed in His name, beholding His signs which He did.” And as they believe the
signs and not in Him but in His name, Jesus “did not trust Himself to them, because He
knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man, because He knew what is in
every man.”</p>

<head>29. About What Beings Jesus Needed Testimony.</head>
<p>The words, “He needed not that any should testify of man,” may fitly be used to show
that the Son of God is able of Himself to see the truth about each man and is in no need of
such testimony as any other could supply. The words, however, “He had no need that any
should testify of man,” are not equivalent to “He had no need of testimony about any being.”
If we take the word “man” to include every being who is according to the image of God, or
every reasonable creature, then He will have no need that any should testify to Him of any
reasonable being whatever, since He Himself, by the power given Him by the Father, knows
them all. But if the term “man” be restricted to mortal animated reasonable beings, then it
might be said, on the one hand, that He had need of testimony respecting the beings above
man, and while His knowledge was adequate with regard to man it did not extend to those
other beings. On the other hand, however, it might be said that He who humbled Himself
had no need that any should testify to Him concerning man, but that He had such need in
respect of beings higher than men.</p>

<head>30. How Jesus Knew the Powers, Better or Worse, Which Reside in Man.</head>
<p>It may also be asked what signs those many saw Him do who believed on Him, for it is
not recorded that He did any signs at Jerusalem, though some may have been done which
are not recorded. One may, however, consider if what He did may be called signs, when
He made a scourge of small cords, and cast them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and
the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables. As for those who
suppose that it was only about men that He had no need of witnesses, it has to be said that
the Evangelist attributes to Him two things, that He knew all beings, and that He had no
need that any one should testify of man. If He knew all beings, then He knew not only men
but the beings above men, all beings who are without such bodies as ours; and He knew
what was in man, since He was greater than those who reproved and judged by prophesying,
and who brought to the light the secret things of the hearts of those whom the Spirit suggested
to them to be thus dealt with. The words, “He knew what was in man,” could also be taken
as referring to the powers, better or worse, which work in men. For if any one gives place
to the devil, Satan enters into him; thus did Judas give place, and thus did the devil put it in
his heart to betray Jesus, and “after the sop,” therefore, “the devil entered into him.”5148
But if any one gives place to God, he becomes blessed; for blessed is the man whose help is
from God, and the ascent is in his heart from God.5149 Thou knowest what is in man, Thou
who knowest all things, O Son of God. And now that our tenth book has come to be large
enough we will here pause in our theme.</p>

<head>Commentary on Matthew.</head>
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>According to Eusebius (H. E. vi. 36) the Commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew were
written about the same time as the Contra Celsum, when Origen was over sixty years of age,
and may therefore be probably assigned to the period 246–248. This statement is confirmed
by internal evidence. In the portion here translated, books x.–xiv., he passes by the verses
Matt. xviii. 12, 13, and refers for the exposition of them to his Homilies on Luke (book xiii.
29). Elsewhere, he refers his readers for a fuller discussion on certain points to his Commentaries
on John (book xvi. 20), and on Romans (book xvii. 32). Of the twenty-five books
into which the work was divided, the first nine, with the exception of two fragments, are
lost; books x.–xvii., covering the portion from Matt. xiii. 36 to xxii. 33, are extant in the
Greek, and the greater part of the remaining books survives in a Latin version, which is coextensive
with the Greek from book xii. 9 to book xvii. 36, and contains further the exposition
from Matt. xxii. 34 to xxvii. 66. The passages in Cramer’s Catena do not seem to be taken
from the Commentaries. Of the numerous quotations from Matthew only one (Matt. xxi.
35) can be definitely traced to this section of the writings of Origen; and as this differs greatly
from our present text, and is moreover purely narrative, it is probably taken like the others
either from the Scholia (commaticum interpretationis genus), or from the Homilies to which
reference is made by Jerome (Prol. in Matt. I. iv). The majority of them may be ascribed to
the Scholia.</p>
<p>In addition to the mss. already referred to (p. 292) the old Latin version is often useful
for determining the text, though it contains some interpolations and has many omissions.
The omissions (cf. book xiii. 28, book xiv. 1, 3, book xiv. 19–22) are not due to any dogmatic
bias, but have been made by the translator or some subsequent transcriber on the ground
that the passages were uninteresting or unimportant. The version is otherwise for the most
part literal, and has in some cases preserved the correct reading, though it often fails just
when it would have been of most service. For an estimate of the work and method of Origen
as an exegete, see pp. 290–292; and for a fuller statement on some of the points here touched
upon, see Westcott’s article on Origen in Smith’s Dictionary of Christian Biography (vol.

<head>From the First Book of the Commentary on Matthew.5150</head>
<p>Concerning the four Gospels which alone are uncontroverted in the Church of God
under heaven, I have learned by tradition that the Gospel according to Matthew, who was
at one time a publican and afterwards an Apostle of Jesus Christ, was written first; and that
he composed it in the Hebrew tongue and published it for the converts from Judaism. The
second written was that according to Mark, who wrote it according to the instruction of
Peter, who, in his General Epistle, acknowledged him as a son, saying, “The church that is
in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son.”5151 And third,
was that according to Luke, the Gospel commended by5152 Paul, which he composed for
the converts from the Gentiles. Last of all, that according to John.</p>

<p>The Unity and Harmony of Scripture.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the peacemakers.…”5154 To the man who is a peacemaker in either sense
there is in the Divine oracles nothing crooked or perverse, for they are all plain to those who
understand.5155 And because to such an one there is nothing crooked or perverse, he sees
therefore abundance of peace5156 in all the Scriptures, even in those which seem to be at
conflict, and in contradiction with one another. And likewise he becomes a third peacemaker
as he demonstrates that that which appears to others to be a conflict in the Scriptures is no
conflict, and exhibits their concord and peace, whether of the Old Scriptures with the New,
or of the Law with the Prophets, or of the Gospels with the Apostolic Scriptures, or of the
Apostolic Scriptures with each other. For, also, according to the Preacher, all the Scriptures
are “words of the wise like goads, and as nails firmly fixed which were given by agreement
from one shepherd;”5157 and there is nothing superfluous in them. But the Word is the one
Shepherd of things rational which may have an appearance of discord to those who have
not ears to hear, but are truly at perfect concord. For as the different chords of the psalter
or the lyre, each of which gives forth a certain sound of its own which seems unlike the
sound of another chord, are thought by a man who is not musical and ignorant of the
principle of musical harmony, to be inharmonious, because of the dissimilarity of the sounds,
so those who are not skilled in hearing the harmony of God in the sacred Scriptures think
that the Old is not in harmony with the New, or the Prophets with the Law, or the Gospels
with one another, or the Apostle with the Gospel, or with himself, or with the other Apostles.
But he who comes instructed in the music of God, being a man wise in word and deed, and,
on this account, like another David—which is, by interpretation, skilful with the hand—will
bring out the sound of the music of God, having learned from this at the right time to strike
the chords, now the chords of the Law, now the Gospel chords in harmony with them, and

again the Prophetic chords, and, when reason demands it, the Apostolic chords which are
in harmony with the Prophetic, and likewise the Apostolic with those of the Gospels. For
he knows that all the Scripture is the one perfect and harmonised5158 instrument of God,
which from different sounds gives forth one saving voice to those willing to learn, which
stops and restrains every working of an evil spirit, just as the music of David laid to rest the
evil spirit in Saul, which also was choking him.5159 You see, then, that he is in the third
place a peacemaker, who sees in accordance with the Scripture the peace of it all, and implants
this peace in those who rightly seek and make nice distinctions in a genuine spirit.</p>

<head>1. The Parable of the Tares: the House of Jesus.</head>
<p>“Then He left the multitudes and went into His house, and His disciples came unto Him
saying, Declare to us the parable of the tares of the field.”5160 When Jesus then is with the
multitudes, He is not in His house, for the multitudes are outside of the house, and it is an
act which springs from His love of men to leave the house and to go away to those who are
not able to come to Him. Now, having discoursed sufficiently to the multitudes in parables,
He sends them away and goes to His own house, where His disciples, who did not abide
with those whom He had sent away, come to Him. And as many as are more genuine
hearers of Jesus first follow Him, then having inquired about His abode, are permitted to
see it, and, having come, see and abide with Him, all for that day, and perhaps some of them
even longer. And, in my opinion, such things are indicated in the Gospel according to John
in these words, “On the morrow again John was standing and two of his disciples.”5161 And
in order to explain the fact that of those who were permitted to go with Jesus and see His
abode, the one who was more eminent becomes also an Apostle, these words are added:
“One of the two that heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s
brother.”5162 And if then, unlike the multitudes whom He sends away, we wish to hear Jesus
and go to the house and receive something better than the multitudes, let us become friends
of Jesus, so that as His disciples we may come to Him when He goes into the house, and
having come may inquire about the explanation of the parable, whether of the tares of the
field, or of any other. And in order that it may be more accurately understood what is represented
by the house of Jesus, let some one collect from the Gospels whatsoever things are
spoken about the house of Jesus, and what things were spoken or done by Him in it; for all
the passages collected together will convince any one who applies himself to this reading
that the letters of the Gospel are not absolutely simple as some suppose, but have become
simple to the simple by a divine concession;5163 but for those who have the will and the
power to hear them more acutely there are concealed things wise and worthy of the Word
of God.</p>

<head>2. Exposition of the Parable.</head>
<p>“After these things He answered and said to them, He that soweth the good seed is the
Son of man.”5164 Though we have already, in previous sections, according to our ability
discussed these matters, none the less shall we now say what is in harmony with them, even
if there is reasonable ground for another explanation. And consider now, if in addition to
what we have already recounted, you can otherwise take the good seed to be the children
of the kingdom, because whatsoever good things are sown in the human soul, these are the
offspring of the kingdom of God and have been sown by God the Word who was in the beginning
with God,5165 so that wholesome words about anything are children of the kingdom.
But while men are asleep who do not act according to the command of Jesus, “Watch and
pray that ye enter not into temptation,”5166 the devil on the watch sows what are called
tares—that is, evil opinions—over and among what are called by some natural conceptions,
even the good seeds which are from the Word. And according to this the whole world might
be called a field, and not the Church of God only, for in the whole world the Son of man
sowed the good seed, but the wicked one tares,—that is, evil words,—which, springing from
wickedness, are children of the evil one. And at the end of things, which is called “the consummation
of the age,”5167 there will of necessity be a harvest, in order that the angels of
God who have been appointed for this work may gather up the bad opinions that have grown
upon the soul, and overturning them may give them over to fire which is said to burn, that
they may be consumed. And so the angels and servants of the Word will gather from all
the kingdom of Christ all things that cause a stumbling-block to souls and reasonings that
create iniquity, which they will scatter and cast into the burning furnace of fire. Then those
who become conscious that they have received the seeds of the evil one in themselves, because
of their having been asleep, shall wail and, as it were, be angry against themselves; for this
is the “gnashing of teeth.”5168 Wherefore, also, in the Psalms it is said, “They gnashed upon
me with their teeth.”5169 Then above all “shall the righteous shine,” no longer differently
as at the first, but all “as one sun in the kingdom of their Father.”5170 Then, as if to indicate
that there was indeed a hidden meaning, perhaps, in all that is concerned with the explanation
of the parable, perhaps most of all in the saying, “Then shall the righteous shine as the sun

<head>3. The Shining of the Righteous. Its Interpretation.</head>
<p>But as we said above in reference to the words, “Then shall the righteous shine as the
sun,” that the righteous will shine not differently as formerly, but as one sun, we will, of
necessity, set forth what appears to us on the point. Daniel, knowing that the intelligent are
the light of the world, and that the multitudes of the righteous differ in glory, seems to have
said this, “And the intelligent shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and from among
the multitudes of the righteous as the stars for ever and ever.”5173 And in the passage, “There
is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for
one star differeth from another star in glory: so also is the resurrection of the dead,”5174
the Apostle says the same thing as Daniel, taking this thought from his prophecy. Some
one may inquire how some speak about the difference of light among the righteous, while
the Saviour on the contrary says, “They shall shine as one sun.” I think, then, that at the
beginning of the blessedness enjoyed by those who are being saved (because those who are
not such are not yet purified), the difference connected with the light of the saved takes
place: but when, as we have indicated, he gathers from the whole kingdom of Christ all
things that make men stumble, and the reasonings that work iniquity are cast into the furnace
of fire, and the worse elements utterly consumed, and, when this takes place, those who received
the words which are the children of the evil one come to self-consciousness, then
shall the righteous having become one light of the sun shine in the kingdom of their Father.
For whom will they shine? For those below them who will enjoy their light, after the analogy
of the sun which now shines for those upon the earth? For, of course, they will not shine
for themselves. But perhaps the saying, “Let your light shine before men,”5175 can be written
“upon the table of the heart,”5176 according to what is said by Solomon, in a threefold way;
so that even now the light of the disciples of Jesus shines before the rest of men, and after
death before the resurrection, and after the resurrection “until all shall attain unto a fullgrown
man,”5177 and all become one sun. Then shall they shine as the sun in the kingdom
of their Father.</p>

<head>4. Concerning the Parable of the Treasure Hidden in the Field. The Parable Distinguished
from the Similitude.</head>
<p>“Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field, which a man
found and hid.”5178 The former parables He spoke to the multitudes; but this and the two
which follow it, which are not parables but similitudes in relation to the kingdom of heaven,
He seems to have spoken to the disciples when in the house. In regard to this and the next
two, let him who “gives heed to reading”5179 inquire whether they are parables at all. In the
case of the latter the Scripture does not hesitate to attach in each case the name of parable;
but in the present case it has not done so; and that naturally. For if He spoke to the multitudes
in parables, and “spake all these things in parables, and without a parable spake nothing to
them,”5180 but on going to the house He discourses not to the multitudes but to the disciples
who came to Him there, manifestly the things spoken in the house were not parables: for,
to them that are without, even to those to whom “it is not given to know the mysteries of
the kingdom of heaven,”5181 He speaks in parables. Some one will then say, If they are not
really parables, what are they? Shall we then say in keeping with the diction of the Scripture
that they are similitudes (comparisons)? Now a similitude differs from a parable; for it is
written in Mark, “To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or in what parable shall
we set it forth?”5182 From this it is plain that there is a difference between a similitude and
a parable. The similitude seems to be generic, and the parable specific. And perhaps also
as the similitude, which is the highest genus of the parable, contains the parable as one of
its species, so it contains that particular form of similitude which has the same name as the
genus. This is the case with other words as those skilled in the giving of many names have
observed; who say that “impulse”5183 is the highest genus of many species, as, for example,
of “disinclination”5184 and “inclination,” and say that, in the case of the species which has
the same name as the genus, “inclination” is taken in opposition to and in distinction from
“disinclination.”</p>

<head>5. The Field and the Treasure Interpreted.</head>
<p>And here we must inquire separately as to the field, and separately as to the treasure
hidden in it, and in what way the man who has found this hidden treasure goes away with
joy and sells all that he has in order to buy that field; and we must also inquire—what are
the things which he sells. The field, indeed, seems to me according to these things to be the
Scripture, which was planted with what is manifest in the words of the history, and the law,
and the prophets, and the rest of the thoughts; for great and varied is the planting of the
words in the whole Scripture; but the treasure hidden in the field is the thoughts concealed
and lying under that which is manifest, “of wisdom hidden in a mystery,” “even Christ, in
whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.”5185 But another might say
that the field is that which is verily full, which the Lord blessed, the Christ of God; but the
treasure hidden in it is the things said to have been “hidden in Christ” by Paul, who says
about Christ, “in whom are the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.” The heavenly
things, therefore, even the kingdom of heaven, as in a figure it is written in the Scriptures—
which are the kingdom of heaven, or Christ—Himself the king of the ages, are the
kingdom of heaven which is likened to a treasure hidden in the field.</p>
<note type="footnote">5185 Col. ii. 3.</note>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="801"/>
<head>6. The Exposition Continued.</head>
<p>And at this point you will inquire, whether the kingdom of heaven is likened only to
the treasure hidden in the field, so that we are to think of the field as different from the
kingdom, or is likened to the whole of this treasure hidden in the field, so that the kingdom
of heaven contains according to the similitude both the field and the treasure hidden in the
field. Now a man who comes to the field, whether to the Scriptures or to the Christ who is
constituted both from things manifest and from things hidden, finds the hidden treasure
of wisdom whether in Christ or in the Scriptures. For, going round to visit the field and
searching the Scriptures and seeking to understand the Christ, he finds the treasure in it;
and, having found it, he hides it, thinking that it is not without danger to reveal to everybody
the secret meanings of the Scriptures, or the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ.
And, having hidden it, he goes away, working and devising how he shall buy the field, or
the Scriptures, that he may make them his own possession, receiving from the people of
God the oracles of God with which the Jews were first entrusted.5186 And when the man
taught by Christ has bought the field, the kingdom of God which, according to another
parable, is a vineyard, “is taken from them and is given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
thereof,”5187—to him who in faith has bought the field, as the fruit of his having sold all
that he had, and no longer keeping by him anything that was formerly his; for they were a
source of evil to him. And you will give the same application, if the field containing the
hidden treasure be Christ, for those who give up all things and follow Him, have, as it were
in another way, sold their possessions, in order that, by having sold and surrendered them,
and having received in their place from God—their helper—a noble resolution, they may
purchase, at great cost worthy of the field, the field containing the treasure hidden in itself.</p>

<head>7. The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price. The Formation and Difference of Pearls.</head>
<p>“Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly
pearls.”5188 There are many merchants engaged in many forms of merchandise, but not to
any one of these is the kingdom of heaven like, but only to him who is seeking goodly pearls,
and has found one equal in value to many, a very costly pearl which he has bought in place
of many. I consider it reasonable, then, to make some inquiry into the nature of the pearl.5189
Be careful however to note, that Christ did not say, “He sold all the pearls that he had,” for
he sold not only those which one seeking goodly pearls had bought, but also everything
which he had, in order to buy that goodly pearl. We find then in those who write on the
subject of stones, with regard to the nature of the pearl, that some pearls are found by land,
and some in the sea. The land pearls are produced among the Indians only, being fitted for
signet-rings and collets and necklaces; and the sea pearls, which are superior, are found
among the same Indians, the best being produced in the Red Sea. The next best pearls are
those taken from the sea at Britain; and those of the third quality, which are inferior not
only to the first but to the second, are those found at Bosporus off Scythia. Concerning the
Indian pearl these things further are said. They are found in mussels, like in nature to very
large spiral snail-shells; and these are described as in troops making the sea their pastureground,
as if under the guidance of some leader, conspicuous in colour and size, and different
from those under him, so that he has an analogous position to what is called the queen of
the bees. And likewise, in regard to the fishing for the best—that is, those in India—the
following is told. The natives surround with nets a large circle of the shore, and dive down,
exerting themselves to seize that one of them all which is the leader; for they say that, when
this one is captured, the catching of the troop subject to it costs no trouble, as not one of
those in the troop remains stationary, but as if bound by a thong follows the leader of the
troop. It is said also that the formation of the pearls in India requires periods of time, the
creature undergoing many changes and alterations until it is perfected. And it is further
reported that the shell—I mean, the shell of the animal which bears the pearl—opens and
gapes, as it were, and being opened receives into itself the dew of heaven; when it is filled
with dew pure and untroubled, it becomes illumined and brings forth a large and wellformed
pearl; but if at any time it receives dew darkened, or uneven, or in winter, it conceives
a pearl cloudy and disfigured with spots. And this we also find that if it be intercepted by
lightning when it is on the way towards the completion of the stone with which it is pregnant,
it closes, and, as it were in terror, scatters and pours forth its offspring, so as to form what
are called “physemata.” And sometimes, as if premature, they are born small, and are
somewhat cloudy though well-formed. As compared with the others the Indian pearl has
<note type="footnote">5188 Matt. xiii. 45.</note>
<note type="footnote">5189 Cf.Pliny, Nat. Hist. ix. 54, etc.</note>

<pb n="803"/>
these features. It is white in colour, like to silver in transparency, and shines through as
with a radiance somewhat greenish yellow, and as a rule is round in form; it is also of tender
skin, and more delicate than it is the nature of a stone to be; so it is delightful to behold,
worthy to be celebrated among the more notable, as he who wrote on the subject of stones
used to say. And this is also a mark of the best pearl, to be rounded off on the outer surface,
very white in colour, very translucent, and very large in size. So much about the Indian
pearl. But that found in Britain, they say, is of a golden tinge, but somewhat cloudy, and
duller in sparkle. And that which is found in the strait of Bosporus is darker than that of
Britain, and livid, and perfectly dim, soft and small. And that which is produced in the strait
of Bosporus is not found in the “pinna” which is the pearl-bearing species of shells. but in
what are called mussels; and their habitat—I mean those at Bosporus—is in the marshes.
There is also said to be a fourth class of pearls in Acarnania in the “pinnæ” of oysters. These
are not greatly sought after, but are irregular in form, and perfectly dark and foul in colour;
and there are others also different from these in the same Acarnania which are cast away
on every ground.</p>

<head>8. The Parable Interpreted is the Light of These Views.</head>
<p>Now, having collected these things out of dissertations about stones, I say that the Saviour
with a knowledge of the difference of pearls, of which some are in kind goodly and others
worthless, said, “The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly
pearls;”5190 for, if some of the pearls had not been worthless, it would not have been said,
“to a man seeking goodly pearls.” Now among the words of all kinds which profess to announce
truth, and among those who report them, he seeks pearls. And let the prophets be,
so to speak, the mussels which conceive the dew of heaven, and become pregnant with the
word of truth from heaven, the goodly pearls which, according to the phrase here set forth,
the merchantman seeks. And the leader of the pearls, on the finding of which the rest are
found with it, is the very costly pearl, the Christ of God, the Word which is superior to the
precious letters and thoughts in the law and the prophets, on the finding of which also all
the rest are easily taken. And the Saviour holds converse with all the disciples, as merchantmen
who are not only seeking the goodly pearls but who have found them and possess them,
when He says, “Cast not your pearls before swine.”5191 Now it is manifest that these things
were said to the disciples from that which is prefixed to His words, “And seeing the multitudes
He went up into the mountain, and when He had sat down His disciples came unto Him;”5192
for, in the course of those words, He said, “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither
cast your pearls before the swine.”5193 Perhaps, then, he is not a disciple of Christ, who
does not possess pearls or the very costly pearl, the pearls, I mean, which are goodly; not
the cloudy, nor the darkened, such as the words of the heterodox, which are brought forth
not at the sunrise, but at the sunset or in the north, if it is necessary to take also into the
comparison those things on account of which we found a difference in the pearls which are
produced in different places. And perhaps the muddy words and the heresies which are
bound up with works of the flesh, are the darkened pearls, and those which are produced
in the marshes, not goodly pearls.</p>

<head>9. Christ the Pearl of Great Price.</head>
<p>Now you will connect with the man seeking goodly pearls the saying, “Seek and ye shall
find,”5194 and this—“Every one that seeketh findeth.”5195 For what seek ye? Or what does
every one that seeketh find? I venture to answer, pearls and the pearl which he possesses,
who has given up all things, and counted them as loss; “for which,” says Paul, “I have
counted all things but loss that I may win Christ;”5196 by “all things” meaning the goodly
pearls, “that I may win Christ,” the one very precious pearl. Precious, then, is a lamp to
men in darkness, and there is need of a lamp until the sun rise; and precious also is the glory
in the face of Moses, and of the prophets also, I think, and a beautiful sight, by which we
are introduced so as to be able to see the glory of Christ, to which the Father bears witness,
saying, “This is My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased.”5197 But “that which hath been
made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect by reason of the glory that surpasseth;”
5198 and there is need to us first of the glory which admits of being done away, for
the sake of the glory which surpasseth; as there is need of the knowledge which is in part,
which will be done away when that which is perfect comes.5199 Every soul, therefore, which
comes to childhood, and is on the way to full growth, until the fulness of time is at hand,
needs a tutor and stewards and guardians, in order that, after all these things, he who formerly
differed nothing from a bond-servant, though he is lord of all,5200 may receive, when freed
from a tutor and stewards and guardians, the patrimony corresponding to the very costly
pearl, and to that which is perfect, which on its coming does away with that which is in part,
when one is able to receive “the excellency of the knowledge of Christ,”5201 having been
previously exercised, so to speak, in those forms of knowledge which are surpassed by the
knowledge of Christ. But the multitude, not perceiving the beauty of the many pearls of
the law, and all the knowledge, “in part,” though it be, of the prophets, suppose that they
can, without a clear exposition and apprehension of these, find in whole5202 the one precious
pearl, and behold “the excellency of the knowledge of Christ,” in comparison with which
all things that came before such and so great knowledge, although they were not refuse in

<head>10. The Pearl of the Gospel in Relation to the Old Testament.</head>
<p>“To everything then is its season, and a time for everything under heaven,”5204 a time
to gather the goodly pearls, and a time after their gathering to find the one precious pearl,
when it is fitting for a man to go away and sell all that he has in order that he may buy that
pearl. For as every man who is going to be wise in the words of truth must first be taught
the rudiments, and further pass through the elementary instruction, and appreciate it highly
but not abide in it, as one who, having honoured it at the beginning but passed over towards
perfection, is grateful for the introduction because it was useful at the first; so the perfect
apprehension of the law and the prophets is an elementary discipline for the perfect apprehension
of the Gospel, and all the meaning in the words and deeds of Christ.</p>

<head>11. The Parable of the Drag-Net.</head>
<p>“Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea.”5205 As in the
case of images and statues, the likenesses are not likenesses in every respect of those things
in relation to which they are made; but, for example, the image painted with wax on the
plane surface of wood has the likeness of the surface along with the colour, but does not
further preserve the hollows and prominences, but only their outward appearance; and in
the moulding of statues an endeavour is made to preserve the likeness in respect of the
hollows and the prominences, but not in respect of the colour; and, if the cast be formed of
wax, it endeavours to preserve both, I mean both the colour and also the hollows and the
prominences, but is not indeed an image of the things in the respect of depth; so conceive
with me also that, in the case of the similitudes in the Gospel, when the kingdom of heaven
is likened unto anything, the comparison does not extend to all the features of that to which
the kingdom is compared, but only to those features which are required by the argument
in hand. And here, accordingly, the kingdom of heaven is “like unto a net that was cast into
the sea,” not (as supposed by some,5206 who represent that by this word the different natures
of those who have come into the net, to-wit, the evil and the righteous, are treated of), as if
it is to be thought that, because of the phrase “which gathered of every kind,” there are many
different natures of the righteous and likewise also of the evil; for to such an interpretation
all the Scriptures are opposed, which emphasise the freedom of the will, and censure those
who sin and approve those who do right; or otherwise blame could not rightly attach to
those of the kinds that were such by nature, nor praise to those of a better kind. For the
reason why fishes are good or bad lies not in the souls of the fishes, but is based on that
which the Word said with knowledge, “Let the waters bring forth creeping things with living
souls,”5207 when, also, “God made great sea-monsters and every soul of creeping creatures
which the waters brought forth according to their kinds.”5208 There, accordingly, “The
waters brought forth every soul of creeping animals according to their kinds,” the cause not
being in it; but here we are responsible for our being good kinds and worthy of what are
called “vessels,” or bad and worthy of being cast outside. For it is not the nature in us which
is the cause of the evil, but it is the voluntary choice which worketh evil; and so our nature
is not the cause of righteousness, as if it were incapable of admitting unrighteousness, but
it is the principle which we have admitted that makes men righteous; for also you never see
the kinds of things in the water changing from the bad kinds of fishes into the good, or from
the better kind to the worse; but you can always behold the righteous or evil among men

either coming from wickedness to virtue, or returning from progress towards virtue to the
flood of wickedness. Wherefore also in Ezekiel, concerning the man who turns away from
unrighteousness to the keeping of the divine commandments, it is thus written: “But if the
wicked man turn away from all his wickednesses which he hath done,” etc., down to the
words, “that he turn from his wicked way and live;”5209 but concerning the man who returns
from the advance towards virtue unto the flood of wickedness it is said, “But in the case of
the righteous man turning away from his righteousness and committing iniquity,” etc.,
down to the words, “in his sins which he hath sinned in them shall he die.”5210 Let those
who, from the parable of the drag-net, introduce the doctrine of different natures, tell us in
regard to the wicked man who afterwards turned aside from all the wickednesses which he
committed and keeps all the commandments of God, and does that which is righteous and
merciful, of what nature was he when he was wicked? Clearly not of a nature to be praised.
If verily of a nature to be censured, of what kind of nature can he reasonably be described,
when he turns away from all his sins which he did? For if he were of the bad class of natures,
because of his former deeds, how did he change to that which was better? Or if because of
his subsequent deeds you would say that he was of the good class, how being good by nature
did he become wicked? And you will also meet with a like dilemma in regard to the righteous
man turning away from his righteousness and committing unrighteousness in all manner
of sins. For before he turned away from righteousness, being occupied with righteous deeds
he was not of a bad nature, for a bad nature could not be in righteousness, since a bad
tree—that is wickedness—cannot produce good fruits,—the fruits that spring from virtue.
Again, on the other hand, if he had been of a good and unchangeable nature he would not
have turned away from the good after being called righteous, so as to commit unrighteousness
in all his sins which he committed.</p>

<head>12. The Divine Scriptures Compared to a Net.</head>
<p>Now, these things being said, we must hold that “the kingdom of heaven is likened to
a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind,5211” in order to set forth the
varied character of the principles of action among men, which are as different as possible
from each other, so that the expression “gathered from every kind” embraces both those
worthy of praise and those worthy of blame in respect of their proclivities towards the forms
of virtues or of vices. And the kingdom of heaven is likened unto the variegated texture of
a net, with reference to the Old and the New Scripture which is woven of thoughts of all
kinds and greatly varied. As in the case of the fishes that fall into the net, some are found
in one part of the net and some in another part, and each at the part at which it was caught,
so in the case of those who have come into the net of the Scriptures you would find some
caught in the prophetic net; for example, of Isaiah, according to this expression, or of
Jeremiah or of Daniel; and others in the net of the law, and others in the Gospel net, and
some in the apostolic net; for when one is first captured by the Word or seems to be captured,
he is taken from some part of the whole net. And it is nothing strange if some of the fishes
caught are encompassed by the whole texture of the net in the Scriptures, and are pressed
in on every side and caught, so that they are unable to escape but are, as it were, absolutely
enslaved, and not permitted to escape from the net. And this net has been cast into the
sea—the wave—tossed life of men in every part of the world, and which swims in the bitter
affairs of life. And before our Saviour Jesus Christ this net was not wholly filled; for the net
of the law and the prophets had to be completed by Him who says, “Think not that I came
to destroy the law and the prophets, I came not to destroy but to fulfil.”5212 And the texture
of the net has been completed in the Gospels, and in the words of Christ through the
Apostles. On this account, therefore, “the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was
cast into the sea and gathered of every kind.” And, apart from what has been said, the expression,
“gathered from every kind,” may show forth the calling of the Gentiles from every
race. And those who attended to the net which was cast into the sea are Jesus Christ, the
master of the net, and “the angels who came and ministered unto Him,”5213 who do not
draw up the net from the sea, nor carry it to the shore beyond the sea,—namely, to things
beyond this life, unless the net be filled full, that is, unless the “fulness of the Gentiles” has
come into it. But when it has come, then they draw it up from things here below, and carry
it to what is figuratively called the shore, where it will be the work of those who have drawn
it up, both to sit by the shore, and there to settle themselves, in order that they may place
each of the good in the net into its own order, according to what are here called “vessels,”

but cast without and away those that are of an opposite character and are called bad. By
“without” is meant the furnace of fire as the Saviour interpreted, saying, “So shall it be at
the consummation of the age. The angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among
the righteous and shall cast them into the furnace of fire.”5214 Only it must be observed,
that we are already taught by the parable of the tares and the similitude set forth, that the
angels are to be entrusted with the power to distinguish and separate the evil from the
righteous; for it is said above, “The Son of man shall send forth His angels, and they shall
gather out of His kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity, and
shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.”5215
But here it is said, “The angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the
righteous and shall cast them into the furnace of fire.”</p>

<head>13. Relation of Men to Angels.</head>
<p>From this it does not follow, as some suppose, that the men who are saved in Christ are
superior even to the holy angels; for how can those who are cast by the holy angels into
vessels be compared with those who cast them into vessels, seeing that they have been put
under the authority of the angels? While we say this, we are not ignorant that the men who
will be saved in Christ surpass some angels—namely, those who have not been entrusted
with this office—but not all of them. For we read, “Which things angels desire to look into,”
5216 where it is not said “all” angels. And we know also this—“We shall judge angels”5217
where it is not said “all” angels. Now since these things are written about the net and about
those in the net, we say that he who desires that, before the consummation of the age, and
before the coming of the angels to sever the wicked from among the righteous, there should
be no evil persons “of every kind” in the net, seems not to have understood the Scripture,
and to desire the impossible. Wherefore let us not be surprised if, before the severing of the
wicked from among the righteous by the angels who are sent forth for this purpose, we see
our gatherings also filled with wicked persons. And would that those who will be cast into
the furnace of fire may not be greater in number than the righteous! But since we said in
the beginning, that the parables and similitudes are not to be accepted in respect of all the
things to which they are likened or compared, but only in respect of some things, we must
further establish from the things to be said, that in the case of the fishes, so far as their life
is concerned, an evil thing happens to them when they are found in the net. For they are
deprived of the life which is theirs by nature, and whether they are cast into vessels or cast
away, they suffer nothing more than the loss of the life as it is in fishes; but, in the case of
those to whom the parable refers, the evil thing is to be in the sea and not to come into the
net, in order to be cast along with the good into vessels. And in like manner the bad fishes
are cast without and thrown away; but the bad in the similitude before us are cast into “the
furnace of fire,” that what is said in Ezekiel about the furnace of fire may also overtake
them—“And the Word of the Lord came unto me saying, Son of man behold the house of
Israel is become to me all mixed with brass and iron,” etc., down to the words, “And ye shall
know that I the Lord have poured My fury upon you.”5218</p>

<head>14. The Disciples as Scribes.</head>
<p>“Have ye understood all these things? They say, Yea.”5219 Christ Jesus, who knows the
things in the hearts of men,5220 as John also taught concerning Him in the Gospel, puts the
question not as one ignorant, but having once for all taken upon Him the nature of man,
He uses also all the characteristics of a man of which “asking” is one. And there is nothing
to be wondered at in the Saviour doing this, since indeed the God of the universe, bearing
with the manners of men as a man beareth with the manners of his son, makes inquiry,
as—“Adam, where art thou?”5221 and, “Where is Abel thy brother?”5222 But some one with
a forced interpretation will say here that the words “have understood” are not to be taken
interrogatively but affirmatively; and he will say that the disciples bearing testimony to His
affirmation, say, “Yea.” Only, whether he is putting a question or making an affirmation,
it is necessarily said not “these things” only,—which is demonstrative,—not “all things”
only, but “all these things.” And here He seems to represent the disciples as having been
scribes before the kingdom of heaven;5223 but to this is opposed what is said in the Acts of
the Apostles thus, “Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of
them that they had been with Jesus.”5224 Some one may inquire in regard to these things—if
they were scribes, how are they spoken of in the Acts as unlearned and ignorant men? Or
if they were unlearned and ignorant men, how are they very plainly called scribes by the
Saviour? And it might be answered to these inquiries that, as a matter of fact, not all the
disciples but only Peter and John are described in the Acts as unlearned and ignorant, but
that there were more disciples in regard to whom, because they understood all things, it is
said, “Every scribe,” etc. Or it might be said that every one who has been instructed in the
teaching according to the letter of the law is called a scribe, so that those who were unlearned
and ignorant and led captive by the letter of the law are spoken of as scribes in a particular
sense. And it is very specially the characteristic of ignorant men, who are unskilled in figurative
interpretation and do not understand what is concerned with the mystical5225 exposition
of the Scriptures, but believe the bare letter, and, vindicate it, that they call themselves

scribes. And so one will interpret the words, “Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,”
5226 as having been said to every one that knows nothing but the letter. Here you
will inquire if the scribe of the Gospel be as the scribe of the law, and if the former deals
with the Gospel, as the latter with the law, reading and hearing and telling “those things
which contain an allegory,”5227 so as, while preserving the historic truth of the events, to
understand the unerring principle of mystic interpretation applied to things spiritual, so
that the things learned may not be “spiritual things whose characteristic is wickedness,”5228
but may be entirely opposite to such, namely, spiritual things whose characteristic is goodness.
And one is a scribe “made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven” in the simpler sense,
when he comes from Judaism and receives the teaching of Jesus Christ as defined by the
Church; but he is a scribe in a deeper sense, when having received elementary knowledge
through the letter of the Scriptures he ascends to things spiritual, which are called the
kingdom of the heavens. And according as each thought is attained, and grasped abstractly5229
and proved by example and absolute demonstration, can one understand the
kingdom of heaven, so that he who abounds in knowledge free from error is in the kingdom
of the multitude of what are here represented as “heavens.” So, too, you will allegorise the
word, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand,”5230 as meaning that the
scribes—that is, those who rest satisfied in the bare letter—may repent of this method of
interpretation and be instructed in the spiritual teaching which is called the kingdom of the
heavens through Jesus Christ the living Word. Wherefore, also, so far as Jesus Christ, “who
was in the beginning with God, God the word,”5231 has not His home in a soul, the kingdom
of heaven is not in it, but when any one becomes nigh to admission of the Word, to him the
kingdom of heaven is nigh. But if the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God are the
same thing in reality,5232 if not in idea, manifestly to those to whom it is said, “The kingdom
of God is within you,”5233 to them also it might be said, “The kingdom of heaven is within
you;” and most of all because of the repentance from the letter unto the spirit; since “When
one turn to the Lord, the veil over the letter is taken away. But the Lord is the Spirit.”5234

scribe he has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven, in every word of the Old
Testament, and in all knowledge concerning the new teaching of Christ Jesus, and has this
riches laid up in his own treasure-house—in heaven, in which he stores his treasure as one
who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven,—where neither moth doth consume,
nor thieves break through.5235 And in regard to him, who, as we have said, lays up treasure
in heaven, we may truly lay down that not one moth of the passions can touch his spiritual
and heavenly possessions. “A moth of the passions,” I said, taking the suggestion from the
“Proverbs” in which it is written, “a worm in wood, so pain woundeth the heart of man.”5236
For pain is a worm and a moth, which wounds the heart which has not its treasures in
heaven and spiritual things, for if a man has his treasure in these—“for where the treasure
is, there will the heart be also,”5237—he has his heart in heaven, and on account of it he says,
“Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear.”5238 And so neither
can thieves in regard to whom the Saviour said, “All that came before Me are thieves and
robbers,”5239 break through those things which are treasured up in heaven, and through
the heart which is in heaven and therefore says, “He raised us up with Him, and made us
to sit with Him in the heavenly places in Christ,”5240 and, “Our citizenship is in heaven.”5241</p>

<head>15. The Householder and His Treasury.</head>
<p>Now since “every scribe who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like
unto a man that is a householder who bringeth forth out of his treasury things new and
old,”5242 it clearly follows, by “conversion of the proposition,” as it is called, that every one
who does not bring forth out of his treasury things new and old, is not a scribe who has been
made a disciple unto the kingdom of heaven. We must endeavour, therefore, in every way
to gather in our heart, “by giving heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching,”5243 and by
“meditating in the law of the Lord day and night,”5244 not only the new oracles of the Gospels
and of the Apostles and their Revelation, but also the old things in the law “which has the
shadow of the good things to come,”5245 and in the prophets who prophesied in accordance
with them. And these things will be gathered together, when we also read and know, and
remembering them, compare at a fitting time things spiritual with spiritual, not comparing
things that cannot be compared with one another, but things which admit of comparison,
and which have a certain likeness of diction signifying the same thing, and of thoughts and
of opinions, so that by the mouth of two or three or more witnesses5246 from the Scripture,
we may establish and confirm every word of God. By means of them also we must refute
those who, as far as in them lies, cleave in twain the Godhead and cut off the New from the
Old,5247 so that they are far removed from likeness to the householder who brings forth out
of his treasury things new and old. And since he who is likened to any one is different from
the one to whom he is likened, the scribe “who is made a disciple unto the kingdom of
heaven” will be the one who is likened, but different from him is the householder “who
brings out of his treasury things new and old.” But he who is likened to him, as in imitation
of him, wishes to do that which is like. Perhaps, then, the man who is a householder is Jesus
Himself, who brings forth out of His treasury, according to the time of the teaching, things
new, things spiritual, which also are always being renewed by Him in the “inner man” of
the righteous, who are themselves always being renewed day by day,5248 and old things,
things “written and engraven on stones,”5249 and in the stony hearts of the old man, so that
by comparison of the letter and by exhibition of the spirit He may enrich the scribe who is
made a disciple unto the kingdom of heaven, and make him like unto Himself; until the

disciple shall be as the Master, imitating first the imitator of Christ, and after him Christ
Himself, according to that which is said by Paul, “Be ye imitators of me even as I also of
Christ.”5250 And likewise, Jesus the householder may in the simpler sense bring forth out
of His treasury things new,—that is, the evangelic teaching—and things old,—that is, the
comparison of the sayings which are taken from the law and the prophets, of which we may
find examples in the Gospels. And with regard to these things new and old, we must attend
also to the spiritual law which says in Leviticus, “And ye shall eat old things, and the old
things of the old, and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new; and I will set my
tabernacle among you.”5251 For we eat with blessing the old things,—the prophetic
words,—and the old things of the old things,—the words of the law; and, when the new and
evangelical words came, living according to the Gospel we bring forth the old things of the
letter from before the new, and He sets His tabernacle in us, fulfilling the promise which
He spoke, “I will dwell among them and walk in them.”5252</p>

<head>16. Parables in Relation to Similitudes. Jesus in His Own Country.</head>
<p>“And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed thence. And
coming into His own country.”5253 Since we inquired above whether the things spoken to
the multitude were parables, and those spoken to the disciples were similitudes, and set
forth observations bearing on this in my judgment not contemptible, you must know that
the sentence which is subjoined, “And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables,
He departed thence,” will appear to be in opposition to all these arguments, as applying not
only to the parables, but also to the similitudes as we have expounded. We inquire therefore
whether all these things are to be rejected, or whether we must speak of two kinds of parables,
those spoken to the multitudes, and those announced to the disciples; or whether we are to
think of the name of parable as equi-vocal; or whether the saying, “And it came to pass when
Jesus had finished these parables,” is to be referred only to the parables above, which come
before the similitudes. For, because of the saying, “To you it is given to know the mysteries
of the kingdom of heaven, but to the rest in parables,”5254 it was not possible to say to the
disciples, inasmuch as they were not of those without, that the Saviour spoke to them in
parables. And it follows from this, that the saying, “And it came to pass when Jesus had
finished these parables, He departed thence,” is to be referred to the parables spoken above,
or that the name parable is equivocal, or that there are two kinds of parables, or that these
which we have named similitudes were not parables at all. And observe that it was outside
of His own country He speaks the parables “which, when He had finished, He departed
thence; and coming into His own country He taught them in their synagogue.” And Mark
says, “And He came into His own country and His disciples follow Him.”5255 We must
therefore inquire whether, by the expression, “His own country,” is meant Nazareth or
Bethlehem,—Nazareth, because of the saying, “He shall be called a Nazarene,”5256 or Bethlehem,
since in it He was born. And further I reflect whether the Evangelists could have
said, “coming to Bethlehem,” or, “coming to Nazareth.” They have not done so, but have
named it “His country,” because of something being declared in a mystic sense in the passage
about His country,—namely, the whole of Judæa,—in which He was dishonoured according
to the saying, “A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country.”5257 And if anyone
thinks of Jesus Christ, “a stumbling-block to the Jews,”5258 among whom He is persecuted
even until now, but proclaimed among the Gentiles and believed in,—for His word has run

over the whole world,—he will see that in His own country Jesus had no honour, but that
among those who were “strangers from the covenants,”5259 the Gentiles, He is held in
honour. But what things He taught and spake in their synagogue the Evangelists have not
recorded, but only that they were so great and of such a nature that all were astonished.
And probably the things spoken were too high to be written down. Only be it noted, He
taught in their synagogue, not separating from it, nor disregarding it.</p>

<head>17. The Brethren of Jesus.</head>
<p>And the saying, “Whence hath this man this wisdom,”5260 indicates clearly that there
was a great and surpassing wisdom in the words of Jesus worthy of the saying, “lo, a greater
than Solomon is here.”5261 And He was wont to do greater miracles than those wrought
through Elijah and Elisha, and at a still earlier date through Moses and Joshua the son of
Nun. And they spoke, wondering, (not knowing that He was the son of a virgin, or not believing
it even if it was told to them, but supposing that He was the son of Joseph the carpenter,)
“is not this the carpenter’s son?”5262 And depreciating the whole of what appeared
to be His nearest kindred, they said, “Is not His mother called Mary? And His brethren,
James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us?”5263
They thought, then, that He was the son of Joseph and Mary. But some say, basing it on a
tradition in the Gospel according to Peter,5264 as it is entitled, or “The Book of James,”5265
that the brethren of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom he married before
Mary. Now those who say so wish to preserve the honour of Mary in virginity to the end,
so that that body of hers which was appointed to minister to the Word which said, “The
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow
thee,”5266 might not know intercourse with a man after that the Holy Ghost came into her
and the power from on high overshadowed her. And I think it in harmony with reason that
Jesus was the first-fruit among men of the purity which consists in chastity, and Mary among
women; for it were not pious to ascribe to any other than to her the first-fruit of virginity.
And James is he whom Paul says in the Epistle to the Galatians that he saw, “But other of
the Apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.”5267 And to so great a reputation
among the people for righteousness did this James rise, that Flavius Josephus, who wrote
the “Antiquities of the Jews” in twenty books, when wishing to exhibit the cause why the
people suffered so great misfortunes that even the temple was razed to the ground, said,
that these things happened to them in accordance with the wrath of God in consequence
of the things which they had dared to do against James the brother of Jesus who is called
Christ.5268 And the wonderful thing is, that, though he did not accept Jesus as Christ, he

yet gave testimony that the righteousness of James was so great; and he says that the people
thought that they had suffered these things because of James. And Jude, who wrote a letter
of few lines, it is true, but filled with the healthful words of heavenly grace, said in the preface,
“Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James.”5269 With regard to Joseph and
Simon we have nothing to tell; but the saying, “And His sisters are they not all with us,”5270
seems to me to signify something of this nature—they mind our things, not those of Jesus,
and have no unusual portion of surpassing wisdom as Jesus has. And perhaps by these
things is indicated a new doubt concerning Him, that Jesus was not a man but something
diviner, inasmuch as He was, as they supposed, the son of Joseph and Mary, and the brother
of four, and of the others—the women—as well, and yet had nothing like to any one of His
kindred, and had not from education and teaching come to such a height of wisdom and
power. For they also say elsewhere, “How knoweth this man letters having never
learned?”5271 which is similar to what is here said. Only, though they say these things and
are so perplexed and astonished, they did not believe, but were offended in Him; as if they
had been mastered in the eyes of their mind by the powers which, in the time of the passion,
He was about to lead in triumph on the cross.</p>

<head>18. Prophets in Their Country.</head>
<p>“But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country.”5272
We must inquire whether the expression has the same force when applied universally to
every prophet (as if each one of the prophets was dishonoured in his own country only, but
not as if every one who was dishonoured was dishonoured in his country); or, because of
the expression being singular, these things were said about one. If, then, these words are
spoken about one, these things which have been said suffice, if we refer that which is written
to the Saviour. But if it is general, it is not historically true; for Elijah did not suffer dishonour
in Tishbeth of Gilead, nor Elisha in Abelmeholah, nor Samuel in Ramathaim, nor Jeremiah
in Anathoth. But, figuratively interpreted, it is absolutely true; for we must think of Judæa
as their country, and that famous Israel as their kindred, and perhaps of the body as the
house. For all suffered dishonour in Judæa from the Israel which is according to the flesh,
while they were yet in the body, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, as having been
spoken in censure to the people, “Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute,
who showed before of the coming of the Righteous one?”5273 And by Paul in the First
Epistle to the Thessalonians like things are said: “For ye brethren became imitators of the
churches of God which are in Judæa in Christ Jesus, for ye also suffered the same things of
your own countrymen even as they did of the Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus and the
prophets, and drave out us, and please not God, and are contrary to all men.”5274 A
prophet, then, is not without honour among the Gentiles; for either they do not know him
at all, or, having learned and received him as a prophet, they honour him. And such are
those who are of the Church. Prophets suffer dishonour, first, when they are persecuted,
according to historical fact, by the people, and, secondly, when their prophecy is not believed
by the people. For if they had believed Moses and the prophets they would have believed
Christ, who showed that when men believed Moses and the prophets, belief in Christ logically
followed, and that when men did not believe Christ they did not believe Moses.5275
Moreover, as by the transgression of the law he who sins is said to dishonour God, so by
not believing in that which is prophesied the prophet is dishonoured by the man who disbelieves
the prophecies. And so far as the literal truth is concerned, it is useful to recount what
things Jeremiah suffered among the people in relation to which he said, “And I said, I will
not speak, nor will I call upon the name of the Lord.”5276 And again, elsewhere, “I was

continually being mocked.”5277 And how great sufferings he endured from the then king
of Israel are written in his prophecy. And it is also written that some of the people often
came to stone Moses to death; for his fatherland was not the stones of any place, but the
people who followed him, among whom also he was dishonoured. And Isaiah is reported
to have been sawn asunder by the people; and if any one does not accept the statement because
of its being found in the Apocryphal Isaiah,5278 let him believe what is written thus
in the Epistle to the Hebrews, “They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were
tempted;”5279 for the expression, “They were sawn asunder,” refers to Isaiah, just as the
words, “They were slain with the sword,” refer to Zacharias, who was slain “between the
sanctuary and the altar,”5280 as the Saviour taught, bearing testimony, as I think, to a
Scripture, though not extant in the common and widely circulated books, but perhaps in
apocryphal books. And they, too, were dishonoured in their own country among the Jews
who went about “in sheep-skins, in goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted,” and so on;5281
“For all that will to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”5282 And probably
because Paul knew this, “That a prophet has no honour in his own country,” though he
preached the Word in many places he did not preach it in Tarsus. And the Apostles on this
account left Israel and did that which had been enjoined on them by the Saviour, “Make
disciples of all the nations,”5283 and, “Ye shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all
Judæa and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.”5284 For they did that which
had been commanded them in Judæa and Jerusalem; but, since a prophet has no honour in
his own country, when the Jews did not receive the Word, they went away to the Gentiles.
Consider, too, if, because of the fact that the saying, “I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all
flesh, and they shall prophesy,”5285 has been fulfilled in the churches from the Gentiles, you
can say that those formerly of the world and who by believing became no longer of the
world, having received the Holy Spirit in their own country—that is, the world—and
prophesying, have not honour, but are dishonoured. Wherefore blessed are they who suffer
the same things as the prophets, according to what was said by the Saviour, “For in the same
manner did their fathers unto the prophets.”5286 Now if any one who attends carefully to

these things be hated and attacked, because of his living with rigorous austerity, and his reproof
of sinners, as a man who is persecuted and reproached for the sake of righteousness,
he will not only not be grieved, but will rejoice and be exceeding glad, being assured that,
because of these things, he has great reward in heaven from Him who likened him to the
prophets on the ground of his having suffered the same things. Therefore, he who zealously
imitates the prophetic life, and attains to the spirit which was in them, must be dishonoured
in the world, and in the eyes of sinners, to whom the life of the righteous man is a burden.</p>

<head>19. Relation of Faith and Unbelief to the Supernatural Powers of Jesus.</head>
<p>Following this you may see, “He did not there many mighty works because of their unbelief.”
5287 We are taught by these things that powers were found in those who believed, since
“to every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance,”5288 but among unbelievers
not only did the powers not work, but as Mark wrote, “They could not work.”5289
For attend to the words, “He could not there do any mighty works,” for it is not said, “He
would not,” but “He could not; ”as if there came to the power when working co-operation
from the faith of him on whom the power was working, but this co-operation was hindered
in its exercise by unbelief. See, then, that to those who said, “Why could we not cast it out?”
He said, “Because of your little faith.”5290 And to Peter, when he began to sink, it was said,
“O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?”5291 But, moreover, she who had the
issue of blood, who did not ask for the cure, but only reasoned that if she were to touch the
hem of His garment she would be healed, was healed on the spot. And the Saviour, acknowledging
the method of healing, says, “Who touched Me? For I perceived that power went
forth from Me.”5292 And perhaps, as in the case of material things there exists in some
things a natural attraction towards some other thing, as in the magnet for iron, and in what
is called naphtha for fire, so there is an attraction in such faith towards the divine power,
according to what is said, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove.”5293 And Matthew and
Mark, wishing to set forth the excellency of the divine power, that it has power even in unbelief,
but not so great power as it has in the faith of those who are being benefited, seem to
me to have said with accuracy, not that He did not “any” mighty works because of their
unbelief, but that He did not “many” there.5294 And Mark also does not say, that He could
not do any mighty work there, and stop at that point, but added, “Save that He laid His
hands upon a few sick folk and healed them,”5295 the power in Him thus overcoming the
unbelief. Now it seems to me that, as in the case of material things, tillage is not sufficient
in itself for the gathering in of the fruits, unless the air cooperates to this end, nay, rather,

He who forms the air with whatever quality He wills and makes it whatever He wills; nor
the air apart from tillage, but rather He who by His providence has enacted that the things
which spring up from the earth could not spring up apart from tillage; for this He has done
once for all in the law, “Let the earth put forth grass sowing seed after its kind and after its
likeness;”5296 so also neither do the operations of the powers, apart from the faith of those
who are being healed, exhibit the absolute work of healing, nor faith, however great it may
be, apart from the divine power. And that which is written about wisdom, you may apply
also to faith, and to the virtues specifically, so as to make a precept of this kind, “If any one
be perfect in wisdom among the sons of men, and the power that comes from Thee be
wanting, he will be reckoned as nothing;”5297 or, “If any one be perfect in self-control, so
far as is possible for the sons of men, and the control that is from Thee be wanting, he will
be reckoned as nothing;” or, “If any one be perfect in righteousness, and in the rest of virtues,
and the righteousness and the rest of the virtues that are from Thee be wanting to him, he
will be reckoned as nothing.” Wherefore, “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor
the strong man in his strength,”5298 for that which is fit matter for glorying is not ours, but
is the gift of God; the wisdom is from Him, and the strength is from Him; and so with the
rest.</p>

<head>20. Different Conceptions of John the Baptist.</head>
<p>“At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus and said unto his
own servants, This is John the Baptist.”5299 In Mark5300 it is the same, and also in Luke.5301
The Jews had different opinions, some false, such as the Sadducees held about the resurrection
of the dead, that they do not rise, and in regard to angels that they do not exist, but that
those things which were written about them were only to be interpreted figuratively, but
had no reality in point of fact; and some true opinions, such as were taught by the Pharisees
about the resurrection of the dead that they rise. We must therefore here inquire, whether
the opinion regarding the soul, mistakenly held by Herod and some from among the people,
was somewhat like this—that John, who a little before had been slain by him, had risen from
the dead after he had been beheaded, and was the same person under a different name, and
being now called Jesus was possessed of the same powers which formerly wrought in John.
For what credibility is there in the idea that One, who was so widely known to the whole
people, and whose name was noised abroad in the whole of Judæa, whom they declared to
be the son of the carpenter and Mary, and to have such and such for brothers and sisters,
was thought to be not different from5302 John whose father was Zacharias, and whose
mother was Elisabeth, who were themselves not undistinguished among the people? But it
is probable that the fact of his being the Son of Zacharias was not unknown to the people,
who thought with regard to John that he was truly a prophet, and were so numerous that
the Pharisees, in order to avoid the appearance of saying that which was displeasing to the
people, were afraid to answer the question, “Was his baptism from heaven or from men?”5303
And perhaps, also, to some of them had come the knowledge of the incident of the vision
which was seen in the temple, when Gabriel appeared to Zacharias. What credibility, forsooth,
has the erroneous opinion, whether of Herod or of some of the people, that John and
Jesus were not two persons, but that it was one and the same person John who rose from
the dead after that he had been beheaded and was called Jesus? Some one might say, however,
that Herod and some of those of the people held the false dogma of the transmigration of
souls into bodies, in consequence of which they thought that the former John had appeared
again by a fresh birth, and had come from the dead into life as Jesus. But the time between
the birth of John and the birth of Jesus, which was not more than six months, does not
permit this false opinion to be considered credible. And perhaps rather some such idea as
this was in the mind of Herod, that the powers which wrought in John had passed over to

<pb n="828"/>
Jesus, in consequence of which He was thought by the people to be John the Baptist. And
one might use the following line of argument. Just as because of the spirit and the power
of Elijah, and not because of his soul, it is said about John, “This is Elijah which is to
come,”5304 the spirit in Elijah and the power in him having gone over to John—so Herod
thought that the powers in John wrought in his case works of baptism and teaching,—for
John did not one miracle,5305 but in Jesus miraculous portents. It may be said that something
of this kind was the thought of those who said that Elijah had appeared in Jesus, or that one
of the old prophets had risen.5306 But the opinion of those who said that Jesus was “a
prophet even as one of the prophets,”5307 has no bearing on the question. False, then, is
the saying concerning Jesus, whether that recorded to have been the view of Herod, or that
spoken by others. Only, the saying, “That John went before in the spirit and power of Elijah,”
5308 which corresponds to the thoughts which they were now cherishing concerning
John and Jesus, seems to me more credible. But since we learned, in the first place, that
when the Saviour after the temptation heard that John was given up, He retreated into Galilee,
and in the second place, that when John was in prison and heard the things about Jesus he
sent two of his disciples and said to Him, “Art thou He that cometh, or look we for another?”
5309 and in the third place, generally that Herod said about Jesus, “It is John the Baptist,
he is risen from the dead,”5310 but we have not previously learned from any quarter the
manner in which the Baptist was killed, therefore Matthew has now recorded it, and Mark
almost like unto him; but Luke passed over in silence the greater part of the narrative as it
is found in them.”5311</p>

<head>21. Herod and the Baptist.</head>
<p>The narrative of Matthew is as follows,—“for Herod had laid hold on John and bound
him in the prison.”5312 In reference to these things, it seems to me, that as the law and the
prophets were until John,5313 after whom the grace of prophecy ceased from among the
Jews; so the authority of those who had rule among the people, which included the power
to kill those whom they thought worthy of death, existed until John; and when the last of
the prophets was unlawfully killed by Herod, the king of the Jews was deprived of the power
of putting to death; for, if Herod had not been deprived of it, Pilate would not have condemned
Jesus to death; but for this Herod would have sufficed along with the council of the
chief priests and elders of the people, met for the purpose. And then I think was fulfilled
that which was spoken as follows by Jacob to Judah: “A ruler shall not depart from Judah,
nor a leader from Israel, until that come which is laid up in store, and he is the expectation
of the Gentiles.”5314 And perhaps also the Jews were deprived of this power, the Providence
of God arranging for the spread of the teaching of Christ among the people, so that even if
this were hindered by the Jews, the opposition might not go so far as the slaying of believers,
which seemed to be according to law. “But Herod laid hold on John and bound him in
prison and put him away,”5315 by this act signifying that, so far as it depended on his power
and on the wickedness of the people, he bound and imprisoned the prophetic word, and
prevented him from continuing to abide a herald the truth in freedom as formerly. But this
Herod did for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. For John said unto him,
“It is not lawful for thee to have her.”5316 Now this Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituræa
and of Trachonitis. Some, then, suppose that, when Philip died leaving a daughter, Herodias,
Herod married his brother’s wife, though the law permitted marriage only when there were
no children. But, as we find nowhere clear evidence that Philip was dead, we conclude that
a yet greater transgression was done by Herod, namely, that he had induced his brother’s
wife to revolt from her husband while he was still living.</p>

a divine spirit said to Herod, “It is not lawful for thee to have her; for it is not lawful for thee
to have the wife of thy brother.” For Herod having laid hold on John bound him and put
him in prison, not daring to slay him outright and to take away the prophetic word from
the people; but the wife of the king of Trachonitis—which is a kind of evil opinion and
wicked teaching—gave birth to a daughter of the same name, whose movements, seemingly
harmonious, pleasing Herod, who was fond of matters connected with birthdays, came the
cause of there being no longer a prophetic head among the people. And up to this point I
think that the movements of the people of the Jews, which seem to be according to the law,
were nothing else than the movements of the daughter of Herodias; but the dancing of
Herodias was opposed to that holy dancing with which those who have not danced will be
reproached when they hear the words, “We piped unto you, and ye did not dance.”5317
And on birthdays, when the lawless word reigns over them, they dance so that their movements
please that word. Some one of those before us has observed what is written in Gen-
esis about the birthday of Pharaoh, and has told that the worthless man who loves things
connected with birth keeps birthday festivals; and we, taking this suggestion from him, find
in no Scripture that a birthday was kept by a righteous man. For Herod was more unjust
than that famous Pharaoh; for by the latter on his birthday feast a chief baker is killed;5318
but by the former, John, “than whom no one greater hath risen among those born of women,”
5319 in regard to whom the Saviour says, “But for what purpose did ye go out? To see
a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.”5320 But thanks be unto God,
that, even if the grace of prophecy was taken from the people, a grace greater than all that
was poured forth among the Gentiles by our Saviour Jesus Christ, who became “free among
the dead;”5321 for “though He were crucified through weakness, yet He liveth through the
power of God.”5322 Consider also the word in which pure and impure meats are inquired
into; but prophecy is despised when it is brought forward in a charger instead of meat. But
the Jews have not the head of prophecy, inasmuch as they disown the crown of all prophecy,
Christ Jesus; and the prophet is beheaded, because of an oath in a case where the duty was
rather to break the oath than to keep the oath; for the charge of rashness in taking an oath

and of breaking it because of the rashness is not the same in guilt as the death of a prophet.
And not on this account alone is he beheaded, but because “of those who sat at meat with
him,” who preferred that the prophet should be killed rather than live. And they recline at
the same table and also feast along with the evil word which reigns over the Jews, who make
merry over his birth. At times you may make a graceful application of the passage to those
who swear rashly and wish to hold fast oaths which are taken with a view to unlawful deeds,
by saying that not every keeping of oaths is seemly, just as the keeping of the oath of Herod
was not. And mark, further, that not openly but secretly and in prison does Herod put John
to death. For even the present word of the Jews does not openly deny the prophecies, but
virtually and in secret denies them, and is convicted of disbelieving them. For as “if they
believed Moses they would have believed Jesus,”5323 so if they had believed the prophets
they would have received Him who had been the subject of prophecy. But disbelieving Him
they also disbelieve them, and cut off and confine in prison the prophetic word, and hold
it dead and divided, and in no way wholesome, since they do not understand it. But we
have the whole Jesus, the prophecy concerning Him being fulfilled which said, “A bone shall
not be broken.”5324</p>

<head>23. The Withdrawal of Jesus.</head>
<p>And the disciples of John having come bury his remains, and “they went and told Jesus.”
5325 And He withdrew to a desert place,—that is, the Gentiles—and after the killing of
the prophet multitudes followed Him from the cities everywhere; seeing which to be great
He had compassion on them, and healed their sick; and afterwards with the loaves which
were blessed and multiplied from a few loaves He feeds those who followed Him. “Now
when Jesus heard it He withdrew thence in a boat to a desert place apart.”5326 The letter
teaches us to withdraw as far as it is in our power from those who persecute us, and from
expected conspiracies through words; for this would be to act according to prudence; and,
when one can keep outside of critical positions, to go to meet them is rash and headstrong.
For who would still hesitate about avoiding such things, when not only did Jesus retreat in
view of what happened to John, but also taught and said, “If they persecute you in this city,
flee ye into the other”?5327 When a temptation comes which is not in our power to avoid,
we must endure it with exceeding nobleness and courage; but, when it is in our power to
avoid it, not to do so is rash. But since after the letter we must also investigate the place
according to the mystical meaning, we must say that, when prophecy was plotted against
among the Jews and destroyed, because of their giving honour to matters of birthdays, and
in respect of their reception of vain movements which, though conceived by the ruler of the
wicked and those who feast along with him to be regular and pleasing to them, were irregular
and out of tune, if truth be umpire, then Jesus withdraws from the place in which prophecy
was attacked and condemned; and He withdraws to the place which had been barren of God
among the Gentiles, in order that the Word of God, when the kingdom was taken from the
Jews and “given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,”5328 might be among the
Gentiles; and, on account of it, “the children of the desolate one,” who had not been instructed
either in the law or the prophets, “might be more than of her who has the husband,”5329
that is, the law. When, then, the word was of old among the Jews, it was not so among them
as it is among the Gentiles; wherefore it is said that, “in a boat,”—that is, in the body—He
went to the desert place apart, when He heard about the killing of the prophet. And, having
come into the desert place apart, He was in it, because that the Word dwelt apart, and His
teaching was contrary to the customs and usages which obtained among the Gentiles. And
the crowds among the Gentiles, when they heard that Jesus had come to stay in their desert,
and that He was apart, as we have already reported, followed Him from their own cities,

because each had left the superstitious customs of his fathers and come to the law of Christ.
And by land they followed Him, and not in a boat, inasmuch as not with the body but with
the soul only, and with the resolution to which they had been persuaded by the Word, they
followed the Image of God. And to them Jesus comes out, as they were not able to go to
Him, in order that, having gone to those who were without, He might lead within those
who were without. And great is the crowd without to whom the Word of God goes out,
and, having poured out upon it the light of His “visitation,” beholds it; and, seeing that they
were rather deserving of being pitied, because they were in such circumstances, as a lover
of men He who was impassible suffered the emotion of pity, and not only had pity but healed
their sick, who had sicknesses diverse and of every kind arising from their wickedness.</p>

<head>24. The Diverse Forms of Spiritual Sickness.</head>
<p>And, if you wish to see of what nature are the sicknesses of the soul, contemplate with
me the lovers of money, and the lovers of ambition, and the lovers of boys, and if any be
fond of women; for these also beholding among the crowds and taking compassion upon
them, He healed. For not every sin is to be considered a sickness, but that which has settled
down in the whole soul. For so you may see the lovers of money wholly intent on money
and upon preserving and gathering it, the lovers of ambition wholly intent on a little glory,
for they gape for praise from the masses and the vulgar; and analogously you will understand
in the case of the rest which we have named, and if there be any other like to them. Since,
then, when expounding the words, “He healed their sick,”5330 we said that not every sin is
a sickness, it is fitting to discuss from the Scripture the difference of these. The Apostle indeed
says, writing to the Corinthians who had diverse sicknesses, “For this cause many among
you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.”5331 Hear Him in these words, knitting a band
and making it plaited of different sins, according as some are weak, and others sickly more
than weak, and others, in comparison with both, are asleep. For some, because of impotence
of soul, having a tendency to slip into any sin whatever, although they may not be wholly
in the grasp of any form of sin, as the sickly are, are only weak; but others who, instead of
loving God “with all their soul and all their heart and all their mind,” love money, or a little
glory, or wife, or children, are suffering from something worse than weakness, and are
sickly. And those who sleep are those who, when they ought to be taking heed and watching
with the soul, are not doing this, but by reason of great want of attention are nodding in
resolution and are drowsy in their reflections, such as “in their dreamings defile the flesh,
and set at naught that which is highest in authority, and rail at dignities.”5332 And these,
because they are asleep, live in an atmosphere of vain and dream-like fancies concerning
realities, not admitting the things which are actually true, but deceived by what appears in
their vain imaginations, in regard to whom it is said in Isaiah, “Like as when a thirsty man
dreams that he is drinking, but when he has risen up is still thirsty, and his soul has cherished
a vain hope, so shall be the wealth of all the nations as many as have warred in Jerusalem.”
5333 If, then, we have seemed to make a digression in recounting the difference
between the weak and the sickly and those that sleep, because of that which the Apostle said
in the letter to the Corinthians which we have expounded, we have made the digression in

<head>25. Healing Precedes Participation in the Loaves of Jesus.</head>
<p>After this the word says, “And when even was come, His disciples came to Him, saying,
The place is desert and the time is already past; send, therefore, the multitudes away, that
they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”5335 And first observe that when
about to give to the disciples the loaves of blessing, that they might set them before the
multitudes, He healed the sick, in order that, having been restored to health, they might
participate in the loaves of blessing; for while they are yet sickly, they are not able to receive
the loaves of the blessing of Jesus. But if any one, when he ought to listen to the precept,
“But let each prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread,” etc.,5336 does not obey these
words, but in haphazard fashion participates in the bread of the Lord and His cup, he becomes
weak or sickly, or even—if I may use the expression—on account of being stupefied by the
power of the bread, asleep.</p>

<head>1. Introduction to the Feeding of the Five Thousand.</head>
<p>“And when even was come His disciples came to Him,”5337 that is, at the consummation
of the age in regard to which we may fitly say what is found in the Epistle of John, “It is the
last hour.”5338 They, not yet understanding what the Word was about to do, say to Him,
“The place is desert,”5339 seeing the desert condition of the masses in respect of God and
the Law and the Word; but they say to Him, “The time is past,”5340 as if the fitting season
of the law and prophets had passed. Perhaps they spoke this saying, in reference to the word
of Jesus, that because of the beheading of John both the law and the prophets who were
until John had ceased.5341 “The time is past,” therefore they say, and no food is at hand,
because the season of it is no longer present, that those who have followed Thee in the desert
may serve the law and the prophets. And, further, the disciples say, “Send them away,”5342
that each one may buy food, if he cannot from the cities, at least from the villages,—places
more ignoble. Such things the disciples said, because, after the letter of the law had been
abrogated and prophecies had ceased, they despaired of unexpected and new food being
found for the multitudes. But see what Jesus answers to the disciples though He does not
cry out and plainly say it: “You suppose that, if the great multitude go away from Me in
need of food, they will find it in villages rather than with Me, and among bodies of men,
not of citizens but of villagers, rather than by abiding with Me. But I declare unto you, that
in regard to that of which you suppose they are in need they are not in need, for they have
no need to go away; but in regard to that of which you think they have no need—that is, of
Me—as if I could not feed them, of this contrary to your expectation they have need. Since,
then, I have trained you, and made you fit to give rational food to them who are in need of
it, give ye to the crowds who have followed Me to eat; for ye have the power, which ye have
received from Me, of giving the multitudes to eat; and if ye had attended to this, ye would
have understood that I am far more able to feed them, and ye would not have said, ‘Send
the multitudes away that they may go and buy food for themselves.’”5343</p>

<head>2. Exposition of the Details of the Miracle.</head>
<p>Jesus, then, because of the power which He gave to the disciples, even the power of
nourishing others, said, Give ye them to eat.5344 But (not denying that they can give loaves,
but thinking that there were much too few and not sufficient to feed those who followed
Jesus, and not considering that when Jesus takes each loaf—the Word—He extends it as far
as He wills, and makes it suffice for all whomsoever He desires to nourish), the disciples
say, We have here but five loaves and two fishes.5345 Perhaps by the five loaves they meant
to make a veiled reference to the sensible words of the Scriptures, corresponding in number
on this account to the five senses, but by the two fishes either to the word expressed5346 and
the word conceived,5347 which are a relish, so to speak, to the sensible things contained in
the Scriptures; or, perhaps, to the word which had come to them about the Father and the
Son. Wherefore also after His resurrection He ate of a broiled fish,5348 having taken a part
from the disciples, and having received that theology about the Father which they were in
part able to declare to Him. Such is the contribution we have been able to give to the exposition
of the word about the five loaves and the two fishes; and probably those, who are better
able than we to gather together the five loaves and the two fishes among themselves, would
be able to give a fuller and better interpretation of their meaning. It must be observed,
however, that while in Matthew, Mark, and Luke,5349 the disciples say that they have the
five loaves and the two fishes, without indicating whether they were wheaten or of barley,
John alone says, that the loaves were barley loaves.5350 Wherefore, perhaps, in the Gospel
of John the disciples do not acknowledge that the loaves are with them, but say in John,
“There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fishes.”5351 And so long as these
five loaves and two fishes were not carried by the disciples of Jesus, they did not increase or
multiply, nor were they able to nourish more; but, when the Saviour took them, and in the
first placed looked up to heaven, with the rays of His eyes, as it were, drawing down from
it power which was to be mingled with the loaves and the fishes which were about to feed
the five thousand; and after this blessed the five loaves and the two fishes, increasing and
multiplying them by the word and the blessing; and in the third place dividing and breaking

He gave to the disciples that they might set them before the multitudes, then the loaves and
the fishes were sufficient, so that all ate and were satisfied, and some portions of the loaves
which had been blessed they were unable to eat. For so much remained over to the multitudes,
which was not according to the capacity of the multitudes but of the disciples who
were able to take up that which remained over of the broken pieces, and to place it in baskets
filled with that which remained over, which were in number so many as the tribes of Israel.
Concerning Joseph, then, it is written in the Psalms, “His hands served in the basket,”5352
but about the disciples of Jesus that they took up that which remained over of the broken
pieces twelve baskets, twelve baskets, I take it, not half-full but filled. And there are, I think,
up to the present time, and will be until the consummation of the age with the disciples of
Jesus, who are superior to the multitudes, the twelve baskets, filled with the broken pieces
of living bread which the multitudes cannot eat. Now those who ate of the five loaves which
existed before the twelve baskets that remained over, were kindred in nature to the number
five; for those who ate had reached the stage of sensible things, since also they were nourished
by Him who looked up to heaven and blessed and brake them, and were not boys nor women,
but men. For there are, I think, even in sensible foods differences, so that some of them
belong to those who “have put away childish things,”5353 and some to those who are still
babes and carnal in Christ.</p>

<head>3. The Exposition of Details Continued. The Sitting Down on the Grass. The Division
into Companies.</head>
<p>We have spoken these things because of the words, “They that did eat were five thousand
men, beside children and women,”5354 which is an ambiguous expression; for either those
who ate were five thousand men, and among those who ate there was no child or woman;
or the men only were five thousand, the children and the women not being reckoned. Some,
then, as we have said by anticipation, have so understood the passage that neither children
nor women were present, when the increase and multiplication of the five loaves and the
two fishes took place. But some one might say that, while many ate and according to their
desert and capacity participated in the loaves of blessing, some worthy to be numbered,
corresponding to the men of twenty years old who are numbered in the Book of Numbers,5355
were Israelitish men, but others who were not worthy of such account and numbering were
children and women. Moreover, interpret with me allegorically the children in accordance
with the passage, “I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto
babes in Christ;”5356 and the women in accordance with the saying, “I wish to present you
all as a pure virgin to Christ;”5357 and the men according to the saying, “When I am become
a man I have put away childish things.”5358 Let us not pass by without exposition the words,
“He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass, and He look the five loaves and the
two fishes, and looking up to heaven, He blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to the disciples,
and the disciples to the multitudes. And they did all eat.”5359 For what is meant by the words,
“And He commanded all the multitudes to sit down on the grass?” And what are we to
understand in the passage worthy of the command of Jesus? Now, I think that He commanded
the multitudes to sit down on the grass because of what is said in Isaiah, “All flesh
is grass;”5360 that is to say, He commanded them to put the flesh under, and to keep in
subjection “the mind of the flesh,”5361 that so any one might be able to partake of the loaves
which Jesus blesses. Then since there are different orders of those who need the food which
Jesus supplies and all are not nourished by equal words, on this account I think that Mark
has written, “And He commanded them that they should all sit down by companies upon

the green grass; and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties;”5362 but Luke, “And
He said unto His disciples, Make them sit down in companies about fifty each.”5363 For it
was necessary that those who were to find rest in the food of Jesus should either be in the
order of the hundred—the sacred number—which is consecrated to God, because of the
unit, (in it) or in the order of the fifty—the number which embraces the remission of sins,
in accordance with the mystery of the Jubilee which took place every fifty years, and of the
feast at Pentecost. And I think that the twelve baskets were in the possession of the disciples
to whom it was said “Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”5364
And as the throne of him who judges the tribe of Reuben might be said to be a mystery, and
the throne of him who judges the tribe of Simeon, and another of him who judges the tribe
of Judah, and so on with the others; so there might be a basket of the food of Reuben, and
another of Simeon, and another of Levi. But it is not in accordance with our present discourse
now to digress so far from the subject in hand as to collect what is said about the twelve
tribes, and separately what is said about each of them, and to say what each tribe of Israel
may signify.</p>

<head>4. The Multitudes and the Disciples Contrasted.</head>
<p>“And straightway He constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before
Him unto the other side, till He should send the multitudes away.”5365 It should be observed
how often in the same passages is mentioned the word, “the multitudes,” and another word,
“the disciples,” so that by observing and bringing together the passages about this matter it
may be seen that the aim of the Evangelists was to represent by means of the Gospel history
the differences of those who come to Jesus; of whom some are the multitudes and are not
called disciples, and others are the disciples who are better than the multitudes. It is sufficient,
however, for the present, for us to set forth a few sayings, so that any one who is moved by
them may do the like with the whole of the Gospels. It is written then—as if the multitudes
were below, but the disciples were able to come to Jesus when He went up into the mountain,
where the multitudes were not able to be—as follows: “And seeing the multitudes He went
up into the mountain, and when He had sat down His disciples came unto Him; and He
opened His mouth and taught them saying, Blessed are the poor in spirit,” etc.5366 And
again in another place, as the multitudes stood in need of healing, it is said, “Many multitudes
followed Him and He healed them.”5367 We do not find any healing recorded of the disciples;
since if any one is already a disciple of Jesus he is whole, and being well he needs Jesus not
as a physician but in respect of His other powers. Again in another place, when He was
speaking to the multitudes, His mother and His brethren stood without, seeking to speak
to Him; this was made known to Him by some one to whom He answered, stretching forth
His hand not towards the multitudes but towards the disciples, and said, “Behold My
mother and My brethren,”5368 and bearing testimony to the disciples as doing the will of
the Father which is in heaven, He added, “He is My brother and sister and mother.”5369
And again in another place it is written, “All the multitude stood on the beach and He spake
to them many things in parables.”5370 Then after the parable of the sowing, it was no longer
the multitudes but the disciples who came and said to Him, not “Why speakest thou to us
in parables,” but, “Why speakest thou to them in parables.”5371 Then also He answered
and said, not to the multitudes but to the disciples, “To you it is given to know the mysteries

of the kingdom of heaven, but to the rest in parables.”5372 Accordingly, of those who come
to the name of Jesus some, who know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, would be
called disciples; but those to whom such a privilege is not given would be called multitudes,
who would be spoken of as inferior to the disciples. For observe carefully that He said to
the disciples, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,” but about
the multitudes, “To them it is not given.”5373 And in another place He dismisses the multitudes
indeed, and goes into the house,5374 but He does not dismiss the disciples; and there
came to Him into His house, not the multitudes but His disciples, saying, “Declare to us the
parable of the tares of the field.”5375 Moreover, also, in another place when Jesus heard the
things concerning John and withdrew in a boat to a desert place apart, the multitudes followed
Him; when He came forth and saw a great multitude He had compassion on them and
healed their sick—the sick of the multitudes, not of the disciples.5376 “And when even was
come there came to Him,” not the multitudes, but the disciples, as being different from the
multitudes, saying, “Send the multitudes away that they may go into the villages and buy
themselves food.”5377 And, further, when Jesus took the five loaves and the two fishes, and
looking up to heaven He blessed and brake the loaves, He gave not to the multitudes but to
the disciples,5378 that the disciples might give to the multitudes who were not able to take
from Him, but received with difficulty at the hands of the disciples the loaves of the blessing
of Jesus, and did not eat even all these; for the multitudes were filled and left that which remained
over in twelve baskets which were full.</p>

<head>5. The Disciples in Conflict. Jesus Walks Upon the Waters.</head>
<p>The reason why we have taken up this subject is the passage under discussion which
tells that Jesus separated the disciples from the multitudes, and constrained them to enter
into the boat and to go before Him unto the other side until He Himself should send the
multitudes away;5379 for the multitudes were not able to go away to the other side, as they
were not in the mystic sense Hebrews, which are by interpretation, “dwelling on the other
side.” But this was the work of the disciples of Jesus—I mean to go away to the other side,
and to pass beyond things seen and material, as temporal, and to go on to things unseen
and eternal. To be dismissed by Jesus was a sufficient act of kindness bestowed on the
multitudes by Jesus; for just because they were multitudes they were not able to go away to
the other side; and this kind of dismissal no one has the power to effect save Jesus only, and
it is not possible for any one to be dismissed unless he has first eaten of the loaves which
Jesus blesses. Nor is it possible for any one to eat of the loaves of blessing of Jesus unless he
has done as Jesus commanded and sat down upon the grass as we have told. Nor again was
it possible for the multitudes to do this unless they had followed Jesus from their own cities,
when He withdrew into a desert place apart. And at first, when He was asked by the disciples
to send away the multitudes, He did not send them away until He had fed them with the
loaves of blessing; but now He sends them away, having first constrained the disciples to
enter into the boat; and He sends them away, while they were somewhere below,—for the
desert was below,—but He Himself went up into the mountain to pray.5380 And you must
observe this, that immediately after the five thousand had been fed, Jesus constrained the
disciples to embark into the boat, and to go before Him unto the other side. Only, the disciples
were not able to go before Jesus to the other side; but, when they had got as far as the
middle of the sea, and the boat was distressed “because the wind was contrary to them,”5381
they were afraid when about the fourth watch of the night Jesus came to them. And if Jesus
had not gone up into the boat neither would the wind which was contrary to the disciples
who were sailing have ceased, nor would those who were sailing have gone across and come
to the other side. And, perhaps, wishing to teach them by experience that it was not possible
apart from Him to go to the other side He constrained them to enter into the boat and go
before Him to the other side; but, when they were not able to advance farther than the middle
of the sea, He appeared to them, and did what is written,5382 and showed that he who arrives
at the other side reaches it because Jesus sails along with him. But what is the boat into
which Jesus constrained the disciples to enter? Is it perhaps the conflict of temptations and

difficulties into which any one is constrained by the Word, and goes unwillingly, as it were,
when the Saviour wishes to train by exercise the disciples in this boat which is distressed by
the waves and the contrary wind? But since Mark has made a slight change in the reading,
and for “Straightway He constrained the disciples to enter into the boat and to go before
Him to the other side,” has written, “And straightway He constrained His disciples to enter
into the boat and to go before Him unto the other side unto Bethsaida,”5383 we must attend
to the word, “He constrained,” when first we have seen to the slight variation in Mark who
indicates something more definite by the addition of the pronoun; for the same thing is not
expressed by the words, straightway “He constrained the disciples.” Something more than
“the” disciples simply is written in Mark, namely, “His” disciples. Perhaps, therefore, to
attend to the expression, the disciples who found it hard to tear themselves away from Jesus,
and could not be separated from Him by any ordinary cause, wished to be present with
Him; but He having judged that they should make trial of the waves and of the contrary
wind, which would not have been contrary if they had been with Jesus, put on them the
necessity of being separated from Him and entering into the boat. The Saviour then compels
the disciples to enter into the boat of temptations and to go before Him to the other side,
and through victory over them to go beyond critical difficulties; but when they had come
into the midst of the sea, and of the waves in the temptations, and of the contrary winds
which prevented them from going away to the other side, they were not able, struggling as
they were without Jesus, to overcome the waves and the contrary wind and reach the other
side. Wherefore the Word, taking compassion upon them who had done all that was in
their power to reach the other side, came to them walking upon the sea, which for Him had
no waves or wind that was able to oppose if He so willed; for it is not written, “He came to
them walking upon the waves,” but, “upon the waters;”5384 Just as Peter, who at first when
Jesus said to him, “Come,” went down from the boat and walked not upon “the waves,” but
upon “the waters”5385 to come to Jesus; but when he doubted he saw that the wind was
strong, which was not strong to him who laid aside his little faith and his doubting. But,
when Jesus went up with Peter into the boat, the wind ceased, as it had no power to energise
against the boat when Jesus had gone up into it.</p>

<head>6. Interpretation of the Details in the Narrative.Application Thereof to All Disciples.</head>
<p>And then the disciples “having crossed over came to the land Gennesaret,”5386 of which
word, if we knew the interpretation, we might gain some assistance in the exposition of the
present passage. And observe, since God is faithful, and will not suffer the multitudes to be
tempted above that they are able,5387 in what way the Son of God constrained the disciples
to enter into the boat, as being stronger and able to get as far as the middle of the sea, and
to endure the trials by the waves, until they became worthy of divine assistance, and saw
Jesus and heard Him when He had gone up, and to cross over and come to the land Gennesaret;
but as for the multitudes who, because they were weaker, did not make trial of the
boat and the waves and the contrary wind, them He sent away, and went up into the
mountain apart to pray.5388 To pray for whom? Was it perhaps to pray for the multitudes
that, when they were dismissed after the loaves of blessing, they might do nothing opposed
to their dismissal by Jesus? And for the disciples that, when they were constrained by Him
to enter into the boat and to go before Him unto the other side, they might suffer nothing
in the sea nor from the contrary wind? And I would say with confidence, that, because of
the prayer of Jesus to the Father for the disciples, they suffered nothing when sea and wave
and contrary wind were striving against them. The simpler disciple, then, may be satisfied
with the bare narrative; but let us remember, if ever we fall into distressful temptations, that
Jesus has constrained us to enter into their boat, wishing us to go before Him unto the other
side; for it is not possible for us to reach the other side, unless we have endured the
temptations of waves and contrary wind. Then when we see many difficulties besetting us,
and with moderate struggle we have swum through them to some extent, let us consider
that our boat is in the midst of the sea, distressed at that time by the waves which wish us
to make shipwreck concerning faith or some one of the virtues; but when we see the spirit
of the evil one striving against us, let us conceive that then the wind is contrary to us. When
then in such suffering we have spent three watches of the night—that is, of the darkness
which is in the temptations—striving nobly with all our might and watching ourselves so
as not to make shipwreck concerning the faith or some one of the virtues,—the first watch
against the father of darkness and wickedness, the second watch against his son “who opposeth
and exalteth himself against all that is called God or thing that is worshipped,”5389
and the third watch against the spirit5390 that is opposed to the Holy Spirit, then we believe

that when the fourth watch impendeth, when “the night is far spent, and the day is at
hand,”5391 the Son of God will come to us, that He may prepare the sea for us, walking upon
it. And when we see the Word appearing unto us we shall indeed be troubled before we
clearly understand that it is the Saviour who has come to us, supposing that we are still beholding
an apparition, and for fear shall cry out; but He Himself straightway will speak to
us saying, “Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.”5392 And if, warmly moved by His “Be of
good cheer,” any Peter be found among us, who is on his way to perfection but has not yet
become perfect, having gone down from the boat, as if coming out of that temptation in
which he was distressed, he will indeed walk at first, wishing to come to Jesus upon the waters;
but being as yet of little faith, and as yet doubting, will see that the wind is strong and will
be afraid and begin to sink; but he will not sink because he will call upon Jesus with loud
voice, and will say to Him, “Lord, save me;”5393 then immediately while such a Peter is yet
speaking and saying, “Lord save me,” the Word will stretch forth His hand, holding out assistance
to such an one, and will take hold of him when he is beginning to sink, and will
reproach him for his little faith and doubting.5394 Only, observe that He did not say, “O
thou without faith,” but, “O thou of little faith,” and that it was said, “Wherefore didst thou
doubt,” as he had still a measure of faith, but also had a tendency towards that which was
opposed to faith.</p>

<head>7. The Healing of the Sick on the Other Side. The Method of Healing.</head>
<p>But after this both Jesus and Peter will go up into the boat, and the wind will cease; and
those in the boat, perceiving the great dangers from which they have been saved, will worship
Him, saying, not simply, “Thou art the Son of God,” as also the two demoniacs said, but,
“Of a truth, Thou art the Son of God.”5395 This the disciples in the boat say, for I do not
think that others than the disciples said so. And when we have undergone all these experiences,
having crossed over, we shall come to the land where Jesus commanded us to go before
Him. And perhaps, also, some secret and occult mystery with reference to some who were
saved by Jesus is indicated by the words, “And when the men of that place knew
Him,”—plainly of the place on the other side,—“they sent into all that region round
about,”—round about the other side, not on the other side itself, but round about it,—“and
they brought unto Him all that were sick.”5396 And here observe that they brought unto
Him not only many that were sick, but all in that region round about; and the sick who were
brought to Him besought Him that they might touch if it were only the border of His garment,
5397 beseeching this grace from Him, since they were not like “the woman who had
an issue of blood twelve years, and who came behind Him and touched the border of His
garment, saying within herself, If I do but touch His garment, I shall be made whole.”5398
For observe in what is said about the border of His garment, on account of what the flowing
of her blood ceased at once. But those from the country round the land of Gennesaret, to
which Jesus and His disciples crossed over and came, did not come of themselves to Jesus,
but were brought by those who had sent the tidings, inasmuch as they were not able because
of their extreme weakness to come of themselves. Nor did they merely touch the garment,
like the woman who had an issue of blood, but they touched after that they had besought
Him. Only, of these, “as many as touched were made whole.”5399 And whether there be
any difference between the “They were made whole,”5400 which is said in their case, and
the “being saved,”5401—for it was said to the woman with the issue of blood, “Thy faith hath
saved thee,”5402 you may yourself consider.</p>

<head>8. Concerning the Pharisees and Scribes Who Came and Inquired, Why Do Thy
Disciples Transgress the Tradition of the Elders?</head>
<p>“Then there came to Him from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying, Why do Thy disciples
transgress the tradition of the elders? For they wash not their hands when they eat
bread.”5403 He who observes at what time the Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem
to Jesus, saying, “Why do Thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders,” etc., will perceive
that Matthew of necessity wrote not simply that Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem
came to the Saviour to inquire of Him the matters before us, but put it thus, “Then come
to Him from Jerusalem.” What time, therefore, are we to understand by “then”? At the
time when Jesus and His disciples crossed over and came in the boat to the land of Gennesaret,
when the wind ceased from the time that Jesus entered into the boat, and when “the
men of that place knowing Him sent into all that region round about, and brought unto
Him all that were sick, and besought Him that they might touch if it were only the border
of His garment, and as many as touched were made whole.”5404 At that time came to Him
from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, not struck with admiration at the power which was
in Jesus, which healed those who only touched even the border of His garment, but in a
censorious spirit, accusing the disciples before their Teacher, not concerning the transgression
of a commandment of God, but of a single tradition of the Jewish elders. And it is probable
that this very charge of these censorious persons is a proof of the piety of the disciples of
Jesus, who gave to the Pharisees and scribes no opportunity of censure with reference to
the transgression of the commandments of God, as they would not have brought the charge
of transgression against the disciples, as transgressing the commandment of the elders, if
they had had it in their power to censure those whom they accused, and to show that they
were transgressing a commandment of God. But do not suppose that these things go to
establish the necessity of keeping the law of Moses according to the letter, because the disciples
of Jesus up to that time kept it; for not before He suffered did He “redeem us from
the curse of the law,”5405 who in suffering for men “became a curse for us.” But just as fittingly
Paul became a Jew to the Jews that he might gain Jews,5406 what strange thing is it
that the Apostles, whose way of life was passed among the Jews, even though they understood
the spiritual things in the law, should have used a spirit of accommodation, as Paul also did
when he circumcised Timothy,5407 and offered sacrifice in accordance with a certain legal

vow, as is written in the Acts of the Apostles?5408 Only, again, they appear fond of bringing
accusations, as they have no charge to bring against the disciples of Jesus with reference to
a commandment of God, but only with reference to one tradition of the elders. And especially
does this love of accusation become manifest in this, that they bring the charge in presence
of those very persons who had been healed from their sickness; in appearance against the
disciples, but in reality purposing to slander their Teacher, as it was a tradition of the elders
that the washing of hands was a thing essential to piety. For they thought that the hands of
those who did not wash before eating bread were defiled and unclean, but that the hands
of those who had washed them with water became pure and holy, not in a figurative sense,
in due relation to the law of Moses according to the letter. But let us, not according to the
tradition of the elders among the Jews, but according to sound reason, endeavour to purify
our own actions and so to wash the hands of our souls, when we are about to eat the three
loaves which we ask from Jesus, who wishes to be our friend;5409 for with hands that are
defiled and unwashed and impure, we ought not to partake of the loaves.</p>

<head>9. Explanation of “Corban.”</head>
<p>Jesus, however, does not accuse them with reference to a tradition of the Jewish elders,
but with regard to two most imperative commandments of God, the one of which was the
fifth in the decalogue, being as follows: “Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be
well with thee, and that thy days may be long on the land which the Lord thy God giveth
thee;”5410 and the other was written thus in Leviticus, “If a man speak evil of his father or
his mother, let him die the death; he has spoken evil of his father or mother, he shall be
guilty.”5411 But when we wish to examine the very letter of the words as given by Matthew,
“He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death,”5412 consider whether it
was taken from the place where it was written, “Whoso striketh his father or mother, let
him die the death; and he that speaketh evil of father or mother let him die the death.”5413
For such are the exact words taken from the Law with regard to the two commandments;
but Matthew has quoted them in part and in an abridged form, and not in the very words.
But what the nature of the charge is which the Saviour brings against the Pharisees and
scribes from Jerusalem, when He says that they transgress the commandment of God because
of their tradition we must consider. And God said, “Honour thy father and thy mother,”5414
teaching that the child should pay the honour which is due to his parents. Of this honour
to parents one part was to share with them the necessaries of life, such as food and clothing,
and if there was any other thing in which it was possible for them to show favour towards
their own parents. But the Pharisees and scribes promulgated in opposition to the law a
tradition which is found rather obscurely in the Gospel, and which we ourselves would not
have thought of, unless one of the Hebrews had given to us the following facts relating to
the passage. Sometimes, he says, when money-lenders fell in with stubborn debtors who
were able but not willing to pay their debts, they consecrated what was due to the account
of the poor, for whom money was cast into the treasury by each of those who wished to give
a portion of their goods to the poor according to their ability. They, therefore, said sometimes
to their debtors in their own tongue, “That which you owe to me is Corban,”—that is, a
gift—“for I have consecrated it to the poor, to the account of piety towards God.” Then the
debtor, as no longer in debt to men but to God and to piety towards God, was shut up, as
it were, even though unwilling, to payment of the debt, no longer to the money-lender, but
now to God for the account of the poor, in name of the money-lender. What then the
money-lender did to the debtor, that sometimes some sons did to their parents and said to

<pb n="852"/>
them, “That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me, father or mother, know
that you will receive this from Corban,”5415 from the account of the poor who are consecrated
to God. Then the parents, hearing that that which should have been given to them was
Corban,—consecrated to God,—no longer wished to take it from their sons, even though
they were in extreme need of the necessaries of life. The elders, then, declared to the people
a tradition of this kind, “Whosoever said to his father or mother, that which should be given
to any of them is Corban and a gift, that man was no longer a debtor to his father or mother
in respect of giving to them the necessaries of life.” The Saviour censures this tradition, as
not being sound but opposed to the commandment of God. For if God says, “Honour thy
father and thy mother,” but the tradition said, he is not bound to honour his father or
mother by a gift, who has consecrated to God, as Corban, that which would have been given
to his parents, manifestly the commandment of God concerning the honour due to parents
was made void by the tradition of the Pharisees and scribes which said, that he was no longer
bound to honour his father or mother, who had, once for all, consecrated to God that which
the parents would have received. And the Pharisees, as lovers of money, in order that under
pretext of the poor they might receive even that which would have been given to the parents
of any one, gave such teaching. And the Gospel testifies to their love of money, saying, “But
the Pharisees who were lovers of money heard these things and they scoffed at Him.”5416
If, then, any one of those who are called elders among us, or of those who are in any way
rulers of the people, profess to give to the poor under the name of the commonweal, rather
than to be of those who give to their kindred if they should chance to be in need of the necessaries
of life, and those who give cannot do both, this man might with justice be called
a brother of those Pharisees who made void the word of God through their own tradition,
and were accused by the Saviour as hypocrites. And as a very powerful deterrent to any one
from being anxious to take from the account of the poor, and from thinking that “the piety
of others is a way of gain,”5417 we have not only these things, but also that which is recorded
about the traitor Judas, who in appearance championed the cause of the poor, and said with
indignation, “This ointment might have been sold for three hundred pence and given to
the poor,”5418 but in reality “was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put
therein.”5419 If, then, any one in our time who has the bag of the Church speaks likes Judas
on behalf of the poor, but takes away what is put therein, let there be assigned to him the
portion along with Judas who did these things; on account of which things eating like a

gangrene into his soul, the devil cast it into his heart to betray the Saviour; and, when he
had received the “fiery dart,”5420 with reference to this end, the devil afterwards himself
entered into his soul and took full possession of him. And perhaps, when the Apostle says,
“The love of money is a root of all evils,”5421 he says it because of Judas’ love of money,
which was a root of all the evils that were committed against Jesus.</p>

<head>10. The Traditions of the Elders in Collision with Divine Law.</head>
<p>But let us return to the subject before us, in which the Saviour abridged and expounded
two commandments from the law, the one from the decalogue from Exodus, and the other
from Leviticus, or the other from some one of the books of the Pentateuch. Then since we
have explained in what way they made void the word of God which said, “Honour thy
father and thy mother,” by saying, “Thou shalt not honour thy father or thy mother,” whosoever
shall say to his father or mother, “It is a gift that wherewith thou mightest have been
profited by me,” some one may inquire whether the words, “He that speaketh evil of father
or mother, let him die the death,”5422 are not extraneous. For, granted that he does not
honour his father and mother, who consecrates to what is called Corban that which would
have been given in honour of father and mother, in what way, therefore, does the tradition
of the Pharisees make void the word which said, “He that speaketh evil of father or mother,
let him die the death?” But, perhaps, when any one said to his father or his mother, “It is a
gift, that wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me,”5423 he, as it were, casts abuse
on his father or mother as if he were calling his parents sacrilegious, in taking that which
was consecrated to Corban from him who had consecrated it to Corban. The Jews then
punish their sons5424 according to the law, as speaking evil of father or mother, when they
say to their father or mother, “It is a gift, that wherewith thou mightest have been profited
by me,” but you by one of your traditions make void two commandments of God. And
then you are not ashamed to accuse My disciples who transgress no commandment; for
they walk “in all His commandments and ordinances blamelessly,”5425 but transgress a
tradition of the elders, so as not to transgress a commandment of God. And if you had held
this aim before you, you would have kept the commandment about the honour due to
father and mother, and that which said, “He that speaketh evil of father and mother, let him
die the death;” but the tradition of the elders which is opposed to these commandments you
would not have kept.</p>

<head>11. Exposition of the Prophecy of Isaiah Quoted by Jesus.</head>
<p>And, after this, wishing to refute completely from the words of the prophets all these
traditions of the elders among the Jews, He brought before them a saying, from Isaiah, which
in the exact words is as follows: “And the Lord said, This people draws nigh to Me with
their mouth,” etc.;5426 and, as we said before, Matthew has not written out the prophetical
saying in the very words. And, if it be necessary because of its use in the Gospel to interpret
it according to our ability, we will take in addition the preceding passage which is, in my
judgment, noted with advantage by us for the exposition of that passage in the Gospel which
was taken from the prophet. The passage in Isaiah from the beginning is thus, “Be ye faint,
and be maddened: be ye drunken, but not with strong drink nor with wine: for the Lord
hath given you to drink of the spirit of stupor, and He will close their eyes, both of their
prophets, and of their rulers who see things secret. And all these sayings shall be to you as
the words of the book, which has been sealed, which if they give to a man who knows letters,
saying, Read this, he shall answer, I cannot read, for it is sealed. And this book will be given
into the hands of a man who does not know letters, and one will say to him, Read this, and
he will say, I know not letters. And the Lord said, This people is nigh to Me,” etc., down to
the words, “Woe unto them that form counsel in secret, and their works shall be in darkness.”
5427 Taking up then the passage before us in the Gospel, I have put some of the verses
which come before it, and some which follow it, in order to show in what way the Word
threatens to close the eyes of those of the people who are astonished and drunken, and have
been made to drink of the spirit of deep sleep. And it threatens also to close the eyes of their
prophets and their rulers who profess to see things secret,—which things, I think, took place
after the advent of the Saviour among that people; for all the words of the whole of the
Scriptures, and of Isaiah also, have become to them as the words of a sealed book. Now the
expression “sealed” is used of a book closed in virtue of its obscurity and not open in virtue
of its lucidity, which is equally obscure to those who are not able to read it at all because
they do not know letters, and to those who profess to know letters but do not understand
the meaning in the things which have been written. Well, then, does he add to this, that
when the people, fainting because of their sins and being in a state of madness rage against
Him through those sins wherewith they shall be drunken against Him with the spirit of
stupor, which shall be given to them to drink by the Lord when He closes their eyes, as unworthy
to see, and the eyes of their prophets and of their rulers who profess to see the hidden
things of the mysteries in the Divine Scriptures; and, when their eyes are closed, then shall
the prophetic words be sealed to them and hidden, as has been the case with those who do
not believe in Jesus as the Christ. And when the prophetic sayings have become as the words

of a sealed book, not only to those who do not know letters but to those who profess to
know, then the Lord said, that the people of the Jews draw nigh to God with their mouth
only, and He says that they honour Him with their lips, because their heart by reason of
their unbelief in Jesus is far from the Lord. And now, especially, from the time at which
they denied our Saviour, it might be said about them by God, “But in vain do they worship
Me;”5428 for they no longer teach the precepts of God but of men, and doctrines which are
human and no longer of the Spirit of wisdom. Wherefore, when these things happen to
them, God has removed the people of the Jews, and has caused to perish the wisdom of the
wise men among them; for there is no longer wisdom among them, just as there is no
prophecy; but God has utterly destroyed the prudence of the prudent and concealed it,5429
and no longer is it splendid and conspicuous. Wherefore, although they may seem to form
some counsel in a deep fashion, because they do it not through the Lord they are called
miserable; and even though they profess to tell some secrets of the Divine counsel they lie,
since their works are not works of light, but of darkness and night.5430 I have thought it
right briefly to set forth the prophecy, and to a certain extent elucidate its meaning, seeing
that Matthew made mention of it. And Mark also made mention of it, from whom we may
usefully set down the following words in the place, with reference to the transgression of
the elders who held that it was necessary to wash hands when the Jews ate bread, “For the
Pharisees and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition
of the elders; and when they come from the market-place except they wash themselves
they eat not. And there are some other things which they have received to hold, washings
of cups and pots and brazen vessels and couches.”5431</p>

<head>12. Things Clean and Unclean According to the Law and the Gospel.</head>
<p>“And He called to Him the multitude and said unto them, Hear and understand, ” etc.5432
We are clearly taught in these words by the Saviour that, when we read in Leviticus and
Deuteronomy the precepts about meat clean and unclean, for the transgression of which
we are accused by the material Jews and by the Ebionites who differ little from them, we are
not to think that the scope of the Scripture is found in any superficial understanding of
them. For if “not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which proceedeth
out of the mouth,”5433 and especially when, according to Mark, the Saviour said
these things “making all meats clean,”5434 manifestly we are not defiled when we eat those
things which the Jews who desire to be in bondage to the letter of the law declare to be unclean,
but we are then defiled when, whereas our lips ought to be bound with perception
and we ought “to make for them what we call a balance and weight,”5435 we speak offhand
and discuss matters we ought not, from which there comes to us the spring of sins. And it
is indeed becoming to the law of God to forbid those things which arise from wickedness,
and to enjoin those things which tend to virtue, but as for things which are in their own
nature indifferent to leave them in their own place, as they may, according to our choice
and the reason which is in us, be done ill if we sin in them, but if rightly directed by us be
done well. And any one who has carefully thought on these matters will see that, even in
those things which are thought to be good, it is possible for a man to sin who has taken them
up in an evil way and under the impulse of passion, and that these things called impure may
be considered pure, if used by us in accordance with reason. As, then, when the Jew sins
his circumcision shall be reckoned for uncircumcision, but when one of the Gentiles acts
uprightly his uncircumcision shall be reckoned for circumcision,5436 so those things which
are thought to be pure shall be reckoned for impure in the case of him who does not use
them fittingly, nor when one ought, nor as far as he ought, nor for what reason he ought.
But as for the things which are called impure, “All things become pure to the pure,” for, “To
them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, since both their minds and their
conscience are defiled.”5437 And when these are defiled, they make all things whatsoever
they touch defiled; as again on the contrary the pure mind and the pure conscience make
all things pure, even though they may seem to be impure; for not from intemperance, nor
from love of pleasure, nor with doubting which draws a man both ways, do the righteous

use meats or drinks, mindful of the precept, “Whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever other
thing ye do, do all to the glory of God.”5438 And if it be necessary to delineate the foods
which are unclean according to the Gospel, we will say that they are such as are supplied by
covetousness, and are the result of base love of gain, and are taken up from love of pleasure,
and from deifying the belly which is treated with honour, when it, with its appetites, and
not reason, rules our souls. But as for us who know that some things are used by demons,
or if we do not know, but suspect, and are in doubt about it, if we use such things, we have
used them not to the glory of God, nor in the name of Christ; for not only does the suspicion
that things have been sacrificed to idols condemn him who eats, but even the doubt concerning
this; for “he that doubteth,” according to the Apostle, “is condemned if he eat, because
he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”5439 He then eats in faith who
believes that that which is eaten has not been sacrificed in the temples of idols, and that it
is not strangled nor blood;5440 but he eats not of faith who is in doubt about any of these
things. And the man who knowing that they have been sacrificed to demons nevertheless
uses them, becomes a communicant with demons, while at the same time, his imagination
is polluted with reference to demons participating in the sacrifice. And the Apostle, however,
knowing that it is not the nature of meats which is the cause of injury to him who uses them
or of advantage to him who refrains from their use, but opinions and the reason which is
in them, said, “But meat commendeth us not to God, for neither if we eat are we the better,
nor if we eat not are we the worse.”5441 And since he knew that those who have a loftier
conception of what things are pure and what impure according to the law, turning aside
from the distinction about the use of things pure and impure, and superstition, I think, in
respect of things being different, become indifferent to the use of meats,5442 and on this
account are condemned by the Jews as transgressors of law, he said therefore, somewhere,
“Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink,” etc.,5443 teaching us that the things
according to the letter are a shadow, but that the true thoughts of the law which are stored
up in them are the good things to come, in which one may find what are the pure spiritual
meats of the soul, and what are the impure foods in false and contradictory words which
injure the man who is nourished in them, “For the law had a shadow of the good things to
come.”5444</p>

<head>13. The Offence of the Pharisees.</head>
<p>And as in many cases we have to consider the astonishment of the Jews at the words of
the Saviour, because they were spoken with authority, so also in regard to the words in this
place. Having called the multitudes therefore, He said unto them, “Hear and understand,”5445
etc. And He said this, the Pharisees being offended at this saying, as, because of their evil
opinions and their worthless interpretation of the law, they were not the plant of his own
Father in heaven, and on this account were being rooted up;5446 for they were rooted up as
they did not receive the true vine, which was cultivated by the Father, even Jesus Christ.5447
For how could they be a plant of His Father who were offended at the words of Jesus, words
which turn men away from the precept, “Handle not, nor taste, nor touch,—all which things
were to perish in the using—after the precepts and doctrines of men,”5448 but induce the
intelligent hearer of them to seek in regard to them the things which are above and not the
things upon the earth as the Jews do?5449 And since, because of their evil opinions, the
Pharisees were not the plant of His Father in heaven, on this account, as about such as were
incorrigible, He says to the disciple, “Let them alone;”5450 “Let them alone,” He said for this
reason, that as they were blind they ought to become conscious of their blindness and seek
guides; but they, being unconscious of their own blindness, profess to guide the blind, not
reckoning that they would fall into a pit, about which it is written in the Psalms, “He hath
made a pit, and digged it, and will fall into the ditch which he hath made.”5451 Again, elsewhere
it is written, “And seeing the multitudes, He went up into the mountain, and when
He had sat down His disciples came unto Him;”5452 but here He stretches forth His hand
to the multitude, calling them unto Him, and turning their thoughts away from the literal
interpretation of the questions in the law, when He in the first place said to them, who did
not yet understand what they heard, “Hear and understand,” and thereafter as in parables
said to them, “Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which
proceedeth out of the mouth.”5453</p>

<head>14. Why the Pharisees Were Not a Plant of God. Teaching of Origen on the “Bread
of the Lord.”</head>
<p>After this, it is worth while to look at the phrase which has been assailed in a sophistical
way by those who say5454 that the God of the law and the God of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
is not the same; for they say that the heavenly Father of Jesus Christ is not the husbandman
of those who think that they worship God according to the law of Moses. Jesus Himself
said that the Pharisees, who were worshipping the God who created the world and the law,
were not a plant which His heavenly Father had planted, and that for this reason it was being
rooted up.5455 But you might also say this, that even if it were the Father of Jesus who
“brought in and planted the people,” when it came out of Egypt, “to the mountain of His
own inheritance, to the place which He had prepared for Himself to dwell in,”5456 yet Jesus
would have said, in regard to the Pharisees, “Every plant which My heavenly Father planted
not, shall be rooted up.” Now, to this we will say, that as many as on account of their perverse
interpretation of the things in the law were not a plant of His Father in heaven, were blinded
in their minds, as not believing the truth, but taking pleasure in unrighteousness,5457 by
him who is deified by the sons of this world, and on this account is called by Paul the god
of this world.5458 And do not suppose that Paul said that he was truly God; for just as the
belly, though it is not the god of those who prize pleasure too highly, being lovers of pleasure
rather than lovers of God, is said by Paul to be their god,5459 so the prince of this world, in
regard to whom the Saviour says, “Now has the prince of this world been judged,”5460 though
he is not God, is said to be the god of those who do not wish to receive the spirit of adoption,
in order that they may become sons of that world, and sons of the resurrection from the
dead,5461 and who, on this account, abide in the sonship of this world. I have deemed it
necessary to introduce these matters, even though they may have been spoken by way of
digression, because of the saying, “They are blind guides of the blind.”5462 Who are such?
The Pharisees, whose minds the god of this world hath blinded as they are unbelieving, because
they have not believed in Jesus Christ; and he hath blinded them so that the “light of

the Gospel of the glory of God in the face of Christ should not dawn upon them.”5463 But
not only must we avoid being guided by those blind ones who are conscious that they are
in need of guides, because they have not yet received the power of vision of themselves; but
even in the case of all who profess to guide us in sound doctrine, we must hear with care,
and apply a sound judgment to what is said, lest being guided according to the ignorance
of those who are blind, and do not see the things that concern sound doctrine, we ourselves
may appear to be blind because we do not see the sense of the Scriptures, so that both he
who guides and he who is guided will fall into the ditch of which we have spoken before.
Next to this, it is written in what way Peter answered and said to the Saviour, as if he had
not understood the saying, “Not that which cometh into the mouth defileth the man, but
that which goeth out of the mouth,” “Declare unto us the parable.”5464 To which the Saviour
says, “Are ye also, even yet, without understanding?”5465 As if He had said, “Having been
so long time with Me, do ye not yet understand the meaning of what is said, and do ye not
perceive that for this reason that which goeth into his mouth does not defile the man, because
it passeth into the belly, and going out from it is cast into the draught?”5466 It was not in
respect of the law in which they appeared to believe, that the Pharisees were not a plant of
the Father of Jesus, but in respect of their perverse interpretation of the law and the things
written in it. For since there are two things to be understood in regard to the law, the ministration
of death which was engraven in letters5467 and which had no kinship with the
spirit, and the ministration of life which is understood in the spiritual law, those who were
able with a sincere heart to say, “We know that the law is spiritual,”5468 and therefore “the
law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good,”5469 were the plant which
the heavenly Father planted; but those who were not such, but guarded with care the letter
which killeth only, were not a plant of God but of him who hardened their heart, and put a
veil over it, which veil had power over them so long as they did not turn to the Lord; “for if
any one should turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away, and the Lord is the Spirit.”5470 Now
some one when dealing with the passage might say, that just as “not that which entereth
into the mouth defileth the man,”5471 of even though it may be thought by the Jews to be

defiled, so not that which entereth into the mouth sanctifieth the man, even though what
is called the bread of the Lord may be thought by the simpler disciples to sanctify. And the
saying is I think, not to be despised, and on this account, demands clear exposition, which
seems to me to be thus; as it is not the meat but the conscience of him who eats with doubt
which defiles him that eateth, for “he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth
not of faith,”5472 and as nothing is pure to him who is defiled and unbelieving, not in itself,
but because of his defilement and unbelief, so that which is sanctified through the word of
God and prayer5473 does not, in its own nature, sanctify him who uses it, for, if this were
so, it would sanctify even him who eats unworthily of the bread of the Lord, and no one on
account of this food would become weak or sickly or asleep for something of this kind Paul
represented in saying, “For this cause many among you are weak and sickly and not a few
sleep.”5474 And in the case of the bread of the Lord, accordingly, there is advantage to him
who uses it, when with undefiled mind and pure conscience he partakes of the bread. And
so neither by not eating, I mean by the very fact that we do not eat of the bread which has
been sanctified by the word of God and prayer, are we deprived of any good thing, nor by
eating are we the better by any good thing; for the cause of our lacking is wickedness and
sins, and the cause of our abounding is righteousness and right actions; so that such is the
meaning of what is said by Paul, “For neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we eat not
are we the worse.”5475 Now, if “everything that entereth into the mouth goes into the belly
and is cast out into the drought,”5476 even the meat which has been sanctified through the
word of God and prayer, in accordance with the fact that it is material, goes into the belly
and is cast out into the draught, but in respect of the prayer which comes upon it, according
to the proportion of the faith, becomes a benefit and is a means of clear vision to the mind
which looks to that which is beneficial, and it is not the material of the bread but the word
which is said over it which is of advantage to him who eats it not unworthily of the Lord.
And these things indeed are said of the typical and symbolical body. But many things might
be said about the Word Himself who became flesh,5477 and true meat of which he that eateth
shall assuredly live for ever, no worthless person being able to eat it; for if it were possible
for one who continues worthless to eat of Him who became flesh, who was the Word and
the living bread, it would not have been written, that “every one who eats of this bread shall
live for ever.”5478</p>

<head>15. Eating with Unwashed Heart Defiles the Man.</head>
<p>Next to this let us see how the things which proceed out and defile the man do not defile
the man because of their proceeding out of the mouth, but have the cause of their defilement
in the heart, when there come forth out of it, before those things which proceed through
the mouth, evil thoughts, of which the species are—murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts,
false witness, railings.5479 For these are the things which defile the man, when they come
forth out of the heart, and going out from it proceed through the mouth; so that, if they did
not come out of the heart, but were retained there somewhere about the heart, and were
not allowed to be spoken through the mouth, they would very quickly disappear, and a man
would be no more defiled. The spring and source, then, of every sin are evil thoughts; for,
unless these gained the mastery, neither murders nor adulteries nor any other such thing
would exist. Therefore, each man must keep his own heart with all watchfulness;5480 for
when the Lord comes in the day of judgment, “He will bring to light the hidden things of
darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts,”5481 “all the thoughts of men
meanwhile accusing or else excusing them,”5482 “when their own devices have beset them
about.”5483 But of such a nature are the evil thoughts that sometimes they make worthy of
censure even those things which seem good, and which, so far as the judgment of the masses
is concerned, are worthy of praise. Accordingly, if we do alms before men, having in our
thoughts the design of appearing to men philanthropic, and of being honoured because of
philanthropy, we receive the reward from men;5484 and, universally, everything that is done
with the consciousness in the doer that he will be glorified by men, has no reward from Him
who beholds in secret, and renders the reward to those who are pure, in secret. So, too,
therefore, is it with apparent purity if it is influenced by considerations of vain glory or love
of gain; and the teaching which is thought to be the teaching of the Church, if it becomes
servile through the word of flattery, either when it is made the excuse for covetousness, or
when any one seeks glory from men because of his teaching, is not reckoned to be the
teaching of those “who have been set by God in the Church: first, apostles; secondly,
prophets; and thirdly, teachers.”5485 And you will say the like in the case of him who seeks
the office of a bishop for the sake of glory with men, or of flattery from men, or for the sake
of the gain received from those who, coming over to the word, give in the name of piety;

for a bishop of this kind at any rate does not “desire a good work,”5486 nor can he be without
reproach, nor temperate, nor sober-minded, as he is intoxicated with glory and intemperately
satiated with it. And the same also you will say about the elders and deacons. And if we
seem to some to have made a digression in speaking of these things, consider if it were not
necessary that they should be said, because that evil thoughts are the spring of all sins, and
can pollute even those actions which, if they were done apart from evil thoughts, would
have justified the man who did them. We have thus investigated according to our ability
what are the things which defile; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man;
but if we must say it with boldness, with unwashed heart to eat anything whatsoever which
is the natural food of our reason, defileth the man.</p>

<head>16. Concerning the Canaanitish Woman. Meaning of the “Borders of Tyre and
Sidon.”</head>
<p>“And Jesus went out thence and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon. And behold
a Canaanitish woman.”5487 Whence the “thence”? Was it from the land of Gennesaret,
concerning which it was said before, “And when they had crossed over they came into the
land of Gennesaret?”5488 But He withdrew, perhaps because the Pharisees were offended
when they heard that “not that which entereth in, but that which proceedeth out, defileth
the man;”5489 and that, because of their being suspected of plotting against Him, it is said,
“He withdrew,” is manifest from the passage, “And when He heard that John was delivered
up He withdrew into Galilee.”5490 Perhaps also on this account, when describing the things
in this place, Mark says that “He rose up and went into the borders of Tyre, and having
entered into the house wished no man to know it.”5491 It is probable that He sought to
avoid the Pharisees who were offended at His teaching, waiting for the time for His suffering,
which was more fitting and rightly appointed. But some one might say that Tyre and Sidon
are used for the Gentiles; accordingly when He withdrew from Israel He came into the parts
of the Gentiles. Among the Hebrews, then, Tyre is called Sor, and it is interpreted “anguish.”
Sidon, which is also the Hebrew name, is rendered “hunters.” And among the Gentiles
likewise the hunters are the evil powers, and among them is great distress, the distress,
namely, which exists in wickedness and passions. When Jesus, then, went out from Gennesaret
He withdrew indeed from Israel and came, not to Tyre and Sidon, but into “the
parts” of Tyre and Sidon, with the result that those of the Gentiles now believe in part; so
that if He had visited the whole of Tyre and Sidon, no unbeliever would have been left in
it. Now, according to Mark, “Jesus rose up and went into the borders of Tyre,”5492—that
is, the distress of the Gentiles,—in order that they also from these borders who believe can
be saved, when they come out of them; for attend to this: “And behold a Canaanitish woman
came out from these borders and cried saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of
David, my daughter is terribly vexed with a demon.”5493 And I think that if she had not
come out from those borders she would not have been able to cry to Jesus with the great
faith to which testimony was borne; and according to the proportion of faith one comes out

from the borders among the Gentiles, which “when the Most High divided the nations He
set up according to the number of the sons of Israel,”5494 and prevented their further advance.
Here, then, certain borders are spoken of as the borders of Tyre and Sidon, but in
Exodus the borders of Pharaoh,5495 in which, they say, were formed the plagues against the
Egyptians. And we must suppose that each of us when he sins is in the borders of Tyre or
Sidon or of Pharaoh and Egypt, or some one of those which are outside the allotted inheritance
of God; but when he changes from wickedness to virtue he goes out from the borders
of evil, and comes to the borders of the portion of God, there being among these also a difference
which will be manifest to those who are able to understand the things that concern
the division and the inheritance of Israel, in harmony with the spiritual law. And attend
also to the meeting, so to speak, which took place between Jesus and the Canaanitish woman;
for He comes as to the parts of Tyre and Sidon, and she comes out of those parts, and cried,
saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David.”5496 Now the woman was
Canaanitish, which is rendered, prepared for humiliation. The righteous, indeed, are prepared
for the kingdom of heaven and for the exaltation in the kingdom of God;5497 but
sinners are prepared for the humiliation of the wickedness which is in them, and of the
deeds which flow from it and prepare them for it, and of the sin which reigns in their mortal
body. Only, the Canaanitish woman came out of those borders and went forth from the
state of being prepared for humiliation, crying and saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord,
Thou Son of David.”</p>

<head>17. Exposition of the Details in the Narrative.</head>
<p>Now bring together from the Gospels those who call Him Son of David, as she, and the
blind men in Jericho;5498 and who call Him Son of God, and that without the addition
“truly” like the demoniacs who say, “What have we to do with Thee, Thou Son of God;”5499
and who call Him so with the addition “truly,” like those in the boat who worshipped Him
saying, “Truly Thou art the Son of God.”5500 For the bringing together of these passages
will, I think, be useful to you with a view to seeing the difference of those who come (to Jesus);
some indeed come as to Him “who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh;”5501
but others come to Him who “was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to
the spirit of holiness;”5502 and of these some with the “truly,” and some without it. Further,
observe, that the Canaanitish woman besought Him not about a son, whom she does not
seem to have brought forth at all, but about a daughter who was terribly vexed with a demon;
but another mother receives back alive her son who was being carried forth dead.5503 And
again the ruler of the synagogue makes supplication for a daughter twelve years old, as being
dead,5504 but the nobleman about a son as being still sick, and at the point of death.5505
The daughter, accordingly, who was distressed by a demon, and the dead son sprang from
two mothers; and the dead daughter, and the son who was sick unto death, sprang from
two fathers, of whom the one was a ruler of the synagogue, and the other was a nobleman.
And I am persuaded these things contain reasons concerning the diverse kinds of souls
which Jesus vivifies and heals. And all the cures that He works among the people, especially
those recorded by the Evangelists, took place at that time, that those who would not otherwise
have believed unless they saw signs and wonders might believe;5506 for the things aforetime
were symbols of the things that are ever being accomplished by the power of Jesus; for there
is no time when each of the things which are written is not done by the power of Jesus according
to the desert of each. The Canaanitish woman, therefore, because of her race was
not worthy even to receive an answer from Jesus, who acknowledged that He had not been

sent by the Father for any other thing than to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,5507—a
lost race of souls possessed of clear vision; but, because of her resolution and of having
worshipped Jesus as Son of God, she obtains an answer, which reproaches her with baseness
of birth and exhibits the measure of her worthiness, namely, that she was worthy of crumbs
as the little dogs, but not of the loaves. But when she with intensified resolution, accepting
the saying of Jesus, puts forth the claim to obtain crumbs even as a little dog, and acknowledges
that the masters are of a nobler race, then she gets a second answer, which bears
testimony to her faith as great, and a promise that it shall be done unto her as she wills.5508
And corresponding, I think, “to the Jerusalem above, which is free, the mother”5509 of Paul
and those like to him, must we conceive of the Canaanitish woman, the mother of her who
was terribly distressed with a demon, who was the symbol of the mother of such a soul.
And consider whether it is not according to sound reason that there are also many fathers
and many mothers corresponding to the fathers of Abraham to whom the patriarch went
away,5510 and to Jerusalem the “mother,” as Paul says, concerning himself and those like
to him. And it is probable that she of whom the Canaanitish woman was a symbol came
out of the borders of Tyre and Sidon, of which the places on earth were types, and came to
the Saviour and besought Him and even now beseeches Him saying, “Have mercy on me,
O Lord, Thou Son of David, my daughter is terribly vexed with a demon.”5511 Then also
to those without and to the disciples when necessary He answers and says, “I was not
sent;”5512 teaching us that there are some lost souls pre-eminently intellectual and clear of
vision, figuratively called sheep of the house of Israel; which things, I think, the simpler who
are of opinion that they are spoken in regard to the Israel which is after the flesh will of necessity
admit, namely, that our Saviour was sent by the Father to no others than to those
lost Jews. But we, who can truthfully boast that “if we have once known Christ after the
flesh, but now no longer do we know Him so,”5513 are assured that it is pre-eminently the
work of the Word to save the more intelligent, for these are more akin to Him than those
who are duller. But since the lost sheep of the house of Israel, with the exception of “the
remnant according to the election of grace,”5514 disbelieved the Word, on this account “God
chose the foolish things of the world,”5515 namely, that which was not Israel, nor clear of

vision, that He might put to shame the wise ones of Israel; and He called “the things which
are not,”5516 handing over to them an intelligent nation who were able to admit “the foolishness
of the preaching,”5517 and of His good pleasure saved those who believe in this, that
He might refute “the things which are,” having perfected praise for Himself, “out of the
mouths of babes and sucklings,”5518 when they became hostile to truth. Now, the Canaanitish
woman, having come, worshipped Jesus as God, saying, “Lord, help me,” but He
answered and said, “It is not possible to take the children’s bread and cast it to the little
dogs.”5519 But some one might inquire also into the meaning of this saying, since,—inasmuch
as there was a measure of loaves such that both the children and the dogs of the household
could not eat loaves, unless the dogs ate other loaves than those which were well made,—it
was not possible according to right reason for the well-made loaf of the children to be given
as food to the little dogs. But no such thing appears in the case of the power of Jesus, for of
this it was possible both for the children and those called little dogs to partake. Consider,
then, whether perhaps with reference to the saying, “It is not possible to take the bread of
children,” we ought to say that, “He who emptied Himself and took upon Him the form of
a servant,”5520 brought a measure of power such as the world was capable of receiving, of
which power also He was conscious that a certain quantity went forth from Him as is plain
from the words, “Some one did touch Me, for I perceived that power had gone forth from
Me.”5521 From this measure of power, then, He dispensed, giving a larger portion to those
who were pre-eminent and who were called sons, but a smaller portion to those who were
not such, as to the little dogs. But though these things were so, nevertheless where there
was great faith, to her, who because of her base birth in Canaanitish land was a little dog,
He gave as to a child the bread of the children. And perhaps, also, of the words of Jesus
there are some loaves which it is possible to give to the more rational, as to children only;
and other words, as it were, crumbs from the great house and table of the wellborn and the
masters, which may be used by some souls, like the dogs. And according to the law of Moses
it is written about certain things, “Ye shall cast them to the dogs,”5522 and it was a matter
of care to the Holy Spirit to give instruction about certain foods that they should be left to
the dogs. Let others, then, who are strangers to the doctrine of the Church, assume that
souls pass from the bodies of men into the bodies of dogs, according to their varying degree

of wickedness; but we, who do not find this at all in the divine Scripture, say that the more
rational condition changes into one more irrational, undergoing this affection in consequence
of great slothfulness and negligence. But, also, in the same way, a will which was more irrational,
because of its neglect of reason, sometimes turns and becomes rational, so that that
which at one time was a dog, loving to eat of the crumbs that fell from the table of its masters,
comes into the condition of a son. For virtue contributes greatly to the making of one a son
of God, but wickedness, and mad fury in wanton discourses and shamelessness, contribute
to the giving of a man the name of dog according to the word of the Scripture.5523 And the
like you will also understand in the case of the other names which are applied to animals
without reason. Only, he who is reproached as a dog and yet is not indignant at being called
unworthy of the bread of children and with all forbearance repeats the saying of that
Canaanitish woman, “Yea, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from
their masters’5524 table,” will obtain the very gentle answer of Jesus saying to him, “Great
is thy faith,”—when he has received so great faith—and saying, “Be it done unto thee even
as thou wilt,”5525 so that he himself may be healed, and if he has produced any fruit which
stands in need of healing, that this, too, may be cured.</p>

<head>18. Concerning the Multitudes Who Were Healed. Comparison of the Mountain
Where Jesus Sat to the Church.</head>
<p>“And Jesus departed thence,”—manifestly, from what has been said before, from the
parts of Tyre and Sidon,—“and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee,”5526 which is commonly
called the Lake of Gennesaret, and again went up into the mountain where He went up and
sat. We may say, then, that into this mountain where Jesus sits, not only the sound in health
go up, but along with the sound, those also who were suffering from various disorders.
And, perhaps, this mountain to which Jesus went up and sat is that which is more commonly
called the Church, which has been set up through the word of God over the rest of the world
and the men upon it; whither go not the disciples only, leaving the multitudes as in the case
of the beatitudes, but great multitudes who were not accused themselves of being deaf or
suffering from any affection, but who had such along with themselves. For you may see,
along with the multitudes who come to this mountain where the Son of God sits, some who
have become deaf to the things promised, and others blind in soul and not looking at the
true light, and others who are lame and not able to walk according to reason, and others
who are maimed and not able to work according to reason. Those, accordingly, who are
suffering in soul from such things, though they go up along with the multitudes into the
mountain where Jesus was, so long as they are outside of the feet of Jesus, are not healed by
Him; but when, as men suffering from such disorders, they are cast by the multitude at His
feet,5527 and at the extremities of the body of Christ, not being worthy to obtain such things
so far as they themselves are concerned, they are then healed by Him. And when you see
in the congregation of what is more commonly called the church the catechumens cast behind
those who are at the extreme end of it, and as it were at the feet of the body of Jesus—the
church—coming to it with their own deafness and blindness and lameness and crookedness,
and in time cured according to the Word, you would not err in saying that such having gone
up with the multitudes of the church to the mountain where Jesus was, are cast at His feet
and are healed; so that the multitude of the church is astonished at beholding transformations
which have taken place from so great evils to that which is better, so that it might say, those
who were formerly dumb afterwards speak the word of God, and the lame walk, the
prophecy of Isaiah being fulfilled, not only in things bodily but in things spiritual, which
said, “Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of him that hath an impediment
in his speech be plain.”5528 And there, unless the expression, “the lame man shall leap

<pb n="872"/>
as an hart,” is to be taken as accidental, we will say that those formerly lame, and who now
through the power of Jesus leap as an hart are not without design compared to a hart, which
is a clean animal, and hostile to serpents and cannot at all be injured by their poison. But
also, in respect of the fact that the dumb are seen speaking is the prophecy fulfilled which
said, “And the tongue of him that hath an impediment shall be plain,” or rather that which
said, “Hear ye deaf;” but the blind see according to the prophecy following, “Hear ye deaf,
and ye blind look up that ye may see.”5529 Now the blind see, when they see the world and
from the exceeding great beauty of the things created they contemplate the Creator corresponding
in greatness and beauty to them; and when they see clearly “the invisible things of
God Himself from the creation of the world, which are perceived through the things that
are made;”5530 that is, they see and understand with care and clearness. Now the multitudes
seeing these things, glorified the God of Israel,5531 and glorify Him in the persuasion that
it is the same God, who is the Father of Him who healed those previously mentioned, and
the God of Israel. For He is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.5532 Let
us then cause to go up along with ourselves to the mountain where Jesus sits—His
church—those who wish to go up to it along with us, the deaf, the blind, the lame, the
maimed and many others, and let us cast them at the feet of Jesus that He may heal them,
so that the multitudes are astonished at their healing; for it is not the disciples who are described
as wondering at such things, although at that time they were present with Jesus, as
is manifest from the words, “And Jesus called unto Him His disciples and said, I have
compassion on the multitudes,”5533 etc.; and perhaps if you attend carefully to the words,
“There came unto Him great multitudes,”5534 you would find that the disciples at that time
did not come to Him, but had begun long ago to follow Him and followed Him into the
mountain. But there came unto Him those who were inferior to the disciples, and were
then for the first time approaching Him, who had not the same experience as those who
had gone up with them. Observe, moreover, in the Gospel who are described as having
followed Jesus, and who as having come to Him, and who as having been brought to Him,
and the division between those who go before and of those who follow; and of those who
came, who came to Him in the house, and who when He was elsewhere. For by observation,
and by comparing things spiritual with spiritual, you would find many things worthy of the
accurate wisdom in the Gospels.</p>

<head>19. Concerning the Seven Loaves. The Narrative of the Feeding of the Four Thousand
Compared with that of the Five Thousand.</head>
<p>“And Jesus called unto Him His disciples and said.”5535 Above in the similar history to
this about the loaves, before the loaves are spoken of, “Jesus came forth and saw a great
multitude and had compassion upon them and healed their sick. And when even was come
the disciples came to Him saying, The place is desert and the time is already past, send them
away,”5536 etc. But now after the healing of the deaf and the rest, He takes compassion on
the multitude which had continued with Him now three days and had nothing to eat. And
there the disciples make request concerning the five thousand;5537 but here He speaks of
His own accord about the four thousand.5538 Those, too, are fed when it was evening after
they had spent a day with Him; but these, who are testified to have continued with Him
three days, partake of the loaves lest they might faint by the way. And there the disciples
say to Him when He was not inquiring, that they had only five loaves and two fishes; but
here to Him making inquiry, they give answer about the seven loaves and the few small
fishes. And there He commands the multitudes to sit down or lie upon the grass; for Luke
also wrote, “Make them sit down,”5539 and Mark says, “He commanded them all to sit
down;”5540 but here He does not command but proclaims5541 to the multitude to sit down.
Again, there, the three Evangelists say in the very same words that “He took the five loaves
and the two fishes and looking up to heaven He blessed;”5542 but here, as Matthew and
Mark have written, “Jesus gave thanks and brake;”5543 there, they recline upon the grass,
but here they sit down upon the ground. You will moreover investigate in the accounts in
the different places the variation found in John, who wrote in regard to that transaction that
Jesus said, “Make the men sit down,”5544 and that, having given thanks, He gave of the
loaves to them that were set down, but he did not mention this miracle at all.5545 Attending,
then, to the difference of those things which are written in the various places in regard to

the loaves, I think that these belong to a different order from those; wherefore these are fed
in a mountain, and those in a desert place; and these after they had continued three days
with Jesus, but those one day, on the evening of which they were fed. And further, unless
it be the same thing for Jesus to do a thing of Himself and to act after having heard from
the disciples, consider if those to whom Jesus shows kindness are not superior when He fed
them on the spot with a view to showing them kindness. And, if according to John,5546
they were barley loaves of which the twelve baskets remained over, but nothing of this kind
is said about these, how are not these superior to the former? And the sick of those He
healed,5547 but here He heals these, along with the multitudes, who were not sick but blind,
and lame, and deaf, and maimed; wherefore also in regard to these the four thousand marvel,
5548 but in regard to the sick no such thing is said. And these I think who ate of the
seven loaves for which thanks were given, are superior to those who ate of the five which
were blessed; and these who ate the few little fishes to those who ate of the two, and perhaps
also these who sat down upon the ground to those who sat down on the grass. And those
from fewer loaves leave twelve baskets, but these from a greater number leave seven baskets,
inasmuch, as they were able to receive more. And perhaps these tread upon all earthly things
and sit down upon them, but those upon the grass—upon their flesh only—for “all flesh is
grass.”5549 Consider also after this, that Jesus does not wish to send them away fasting lest
they faint on the way, as being without the loaves of Jesus, and while they were still on the
way—the way to their own concerns—might suffer injury. Take note also of the cases where
Jesus is recorded to have sent any one away, that you may see the difference of those who
were sent away by Him after being fed, and those who had been sent away otherwise; and,
as a pattern of one who was sent away otherwise, take “Woman, thou art loosed from thine
infirmity.”5550 But further the disciples who are always with Jesus are not sent away by
Him; but the multitudes after they have eaten are sent away. Likewise, again, the disciples
who conceive nothing great about the Canaanitish woman say, “Send her away, for she crieth
after us;”5551 but the Saviour does not at all appear to send her away; for saying unto her,
“O woman, great is thy faith, be it done to thee even as thou wilt,”5552 He healed her
daughter from that hour: it is not however written that He sent her away. So far at the
present time have we been able to investigate and see into the passage before us.</p>

<head>1. Concerning Those Who Asked Him to Show Them a Sign from Heaven.</head>
<p>“And the Sadducees and Pharisees came, and tempting Him kept asking Him to shew
them a sign from heaven.”5553 The Sadducees and Pharisees who disagreed with each other
in regard to the most essential truths,—for the Pharisees champion the doctrine of the resurrection
of the dead, hoping that there will be a world to come, while the Sadducees know
nothing after this life in store for a man whether he has been advancing towards virtue, or
has made no effort at all to come out from the mountains of wickedness,—these, I say, agree
that they may tempt Jesus. Now, a similar thing, as Luke has narrated,5554 happened in the
case of Herod and Pilate, who became friends with one another that they might kill Jesus;
for, perhaps, their hostility with one another would have prevented Herod from asking that
He should be put to death, in order to please the people, who said, “Crucify Him, Crucify
Him,”5555 and would have influenced Pilate, who was somewhat inclined against His condemnation,
his hostility with Herod giving fresh impulse to the inclination which he previ-
ously cherished to release Jesus. But their apparent friendship made Herod stronger in his
demand against Jesus with Pilate, who wished, perhaps, also because of the newly-formed
friendship to do something to gratify Herod and all the nation of the Jews. And often even
now you may see in daily life those who hold the most divergent opinions, whether in the
philosophy of the Greeks or in other systems of thought, appearing to be of one mind that
they may scoff at and attack Jesus Christ in the person of His disciples. And from these
things I think you may go on by rational argument to consider, whether when forces join
in opposition which are in disagreement with one another, as of Pharaoh with Nebuchadnezzar,
5556 and of Tirhakah, king of the Ethiopians, with Sennacherib,5557 a combination
then takes place against Jesus and His people. So perhaps, also, “The kings of the earth set
themselves and the rulers were gathered together,”5558 though not at all before at harmony
with one another, that having taken counsel against the Lord and His Christ, they might
slay the Lord of glory.</p>

<head>2. Why the Pharisees Asked a Sign from Heaven.</head>
<p>Now, to this point we have come in our discourse, because of the Pharisees and Sadducees
coming together unto Jesus, who disagreed in matters relating to the resurrection, but came,
as it were, to an agreement for the sake of tempting our Saviour, and asking Him to show
them a sign from heaven. For, not satisfied with the wonderful signs shown among the
people in the healing of all forms of disease and sickness, and with the rest of the miracles
which our Saviour had done in the knowledge of many, they wished Him to show to them
also a sign from heaven. And I conjecture that they suspected that the signs upon earth
might possibly not be of God; for they did not hesitate indeed to say, “Jesus casts out demons
by Beelzebub the prince of the demons;”5559 and it seemed to them that a sign from heaven
could not spring from Beelzebub or any other wicked power. But they erred in regard to
both, in regard to signs upon earth as well as to signs from heaven, not being “approved
money-changers,”5560 nor knowing how to distinguish between the spirits that are working,
which kind are from God, and which have revolted from Him. And they ought to have
known that even many of the portents wrought against Egypt in the time of Moses, though
they were not from heaven, were clearly from God, and that the fire which fell from heaven
upon the sheep of Job was not from God;5561 for that fire belonged to the same one as he
to whom belonged those who carried off, and made three bands of horsemen against, the
cattle of Job. I think, moreover, that in Isaiah—as if signs could be shown both from the
earth and from heaven, the true being from God, but “with all power and signs and lying
wonders”5562 those from the evil one—it was said to Ahaz, “Ask for thyself a sign from the
Lord thy God in the depth or in the height.”5563 For, unless there had been some signs in
the depth or in the height which were not from the Lord God, this would not have been
said, “Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord thy God in the depth or in the height.” But I
know well that such an interpretation of the passage, “Ask for thyself a sign from the Lord
thy God,” will seem to some one rather forced; but give heed to that which is said by the
Apostle about the man of sin, the son of perdition, that, “with all power and signs and lying
wonders and with all deceit of unrighteousness,”5564 he shall be manifested to them that
are perishing, imitating all kinds of wonders, to-wit, those of truth. And as the enchanters
and magicians of the Egyptians, as being inferior to the man of sin and the son of perdition,

imitated certain powers, both the signs and wonders of truth, doing lying wonders so that
the true might not be believed; so I think the man of sin will imitate signs and powers. And
perhaps, also, the Pharisees suspected these things because of the prophecies concerning
Him; but I inquire whether also the Sadducees tempting Him asked Jesus to show them a
sign from heaven. For unless we say that they suspected this, how shall we describe their
relation to the portents which Jesus wrought, who continued hard-hearted and were not
put to shame by the miraculous things that were done? But if any one supposes that we
have given an occasion of defence to the Pharisees and Sadducees, both when they say that
the demons were cast out by Jesus through Beelzebub, and when tempting Him, they ask
Jesus about a heavenly sign, let him know that we plausibly say that they were drawn away
to the end that they might not believe in the miracles of Jesus; but not as to deserve forgiveness;
for they did not look to the words of the prophets which were being fulfilled in the
acts of Jesus, which an evil power was not at all capable of imitating. But to bring back a
soul which had gone out, so that it came out of the grave when already stinking and passing
the fourth day,5565 was the work of no other than Him who heard the word of the Father,
“Let us make man after our image and likeness.”5566 But also to command the winds and
to make the violence of the sea cease at a word, was the work of no other than Him through
whom all things, both the sea itself and the winds, have come into being. Moreover also as
to the teaching which stimulates men to the love of the Creator, in harmony with the law
and the prophets, and which checks passions and moulds morals according to piety, what
else did it indicate to such as were able to see, than that He was truly the Son of God who
wrought works so mighty? In respect of which things He said also to the disciples of John,
“Go your way and tell John what great things ye see and hear; the blind receive their sight,”
etc.5567</p>

<head>3. The Answer of Jesus to Their Request.</head>
<p>Next let us remark in what way, when asked in regard to one sign, that He might show
it from heaven, to the Pharisees and Sadducees who put the question, He answers and says,
“An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall be no sign given to it,
but the sign of Jonah the prophet, ” when also, “He left them and departed.”5568 But the sign
of Jonah, in truth, according to their question, was not merely a sign but also a sign from
heaven; so that even to those who tempted Him and sought a sign from heaven He, nevertheless,
out of His own great goodness gave the sign. For if, as Jonah passed three days and
three nights in the whale’s belly, so the Son of man did in the heart of the earth, and after
this rose up from it,—whence but from heaven shall we say that the sign of the resurrection
of Christ came? And especially when, at the time of the passion, He became a sign to the
robber who obtained favour from Him to enter into the paradise of God; after this, I think,
descending into Hades to the dead, “as free among the dead.”5569 And the Saviour seems
to me to conjoin the sign which was to come from Himself with the reason of the sign in
regard to Jonah when He says, not merely that a sign like to that is granted by Him but that
very sign; for attend to the words, “And there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah
the prophet.”5570 Accordingly that sign was this sign, because that became indicative of
this, so that the elucidation of that sign, which was obscure on the face of it, might be found
in the fact that the Saviour suffered, and passed three days and three nights in the heart of
the earth. At the same time also we learn the general principle that, if the sign signifies
something, each of the signs which are recorded, whether as in actual history, or by way of
precept, is indicative of something afterwards fulfilled; as for example, the sign of Jonah
going out after three days from the whale’s belly was indicative of the resurrection of our
Saviour, rising after three days and three nights from the dead; and that which is called circumcision
is the sign of that which is indicated by Paul in the words: “We are the circumcision.”
5571 Seek you also every sign in the Old Scriptures as indicative of some passage in
the New Scripture, and that which is named a sign in the New Covenant as indicative of
something either in the age about to be, or even in the subsequent generations after that the
sign has taken place.</p>

<head>4. Why Jesus Called Them an Adulterous Generation. The Law as Husband.</head>
<p>And He called them, indeed, “an evil generation,” because of the quality arising from
evil which had been produced in them, for wickedness is voluntary evil-doing, but “adulterous”
because that when the Pharisees and Sadducees left that which is figuratively called
man, the word of truth or the law, they were debauched by falsehood and the law of sin.
For if there are two laws, the law in our members warring against the law of the mind, and
the law of the mind,5572 we must say that the law of the mind—that is, the spiritual—is man,
to whom the soul was given by God as wife, that is, to the man who is law, according to what
is written, “A wife is married to a man by God;”5573 but the other is a paramour of the soul
which is subject to it, which also on account of it is called an adulteress. Now that the law
is husband of the soul Paul clearly exhibits in the Epistle to the Romans, saying, “The law
hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth; for the woman that hath a husband
is bound to the husband while he liveth, to the husband who is law,”5574 etc. For consider
in these things that the law hath dominion over the man so long time as the law liveth,—as
a husband over a wife. “For the woman that hath a husband,” that is, the soul under the
law, “is bound to the husband while he liveth,” to the husband who is the law; but if the
husband—that is, the law die—she is discharged from the law, which is her husband. Now
the law dies to him who has gone up to the condition of blessedness, and no longer lives
under the law, but acts like to Christ, who, though He became under law for the sake of
those under law, that He might gain those under law,5575 did not continue under law, nor
did He leave subject to law those who had been freed by Him; for He led them up along
with Himself to the divine citizenship which is above the law, which contains, as for the
imperfect and such as are still sinners, sacrifices for the remission of sins. He then who is
without sin, and stands no longer in need of legal sacrifices, perhaps when he has become
perfect has passed beyond even the spiritual law, and comes to the Word beyond it, who
became flesh to those who live in the flesh, but to those who no longer at all war after the
flesh, He is perceived as being the Word, as5576 He was God in the beginning with God,
and reveals the Father. Three things therefore are to be thought of in connection with this
place—the woman that hath a husband, who is under a husband—the law; and the woman
who is an adulteress, to-wit, the soul, which, while her husband, the law, liveth, has become
joined to another husband, namely, the law of the flesh; and the woman who is married to

the brother of the dead husband, to the Word who is alive and dies not, who “being raised
from the dead dieth no more, for death hath no more dominion over Him.”5577 So far then
because of the saying, “But if the husband die she is discharged from the law, the husband,”
and because of this, “so then, while her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if
she be joined to another man,” and because of this, “but if the husband die, she is free from
the law, so that she is no adulteress though she be joined to another man.”5578 But this very
saying, “So then while her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress,” we have brought
forward, wishing clearly to show why in answer to the Pharisees and Sadducees who were
tempting Him and asking Him to show them a sign from heaven, He said not only “a wicked
generation,” but an “adulterous” generation.5579 In a general way, then, the law in the
members which wars against the law of the mind,5580 as a man who is an adulterer, is an
adulterer of the soul. But now also every power that is hostile, which gains the mastery over
the human soul, and has intercourse with it, commits adultery with her who had a bridegroom
given to her by God, namely, the Word. After these things it is written that “He left
them and departed.” For how was the bridegroom—the Word—not going to leave the
adulterous generation and depart from it? But you might say that the Word of God, leaving
the synagogue of the Jews as adulterous, departed from it, and took a wife of fornication,5581
namely, those from the Gentiles; since those who were “Sion, a faithful city,”5582 have become
harlots; but these have become like the harlot Rahab, who received the spies of Joshua, and
was saved with all her house;5583 after this no longer playing the harlot, but coming to the
feet of Jesus, and wetting them with the tears of repentance, and anointing them with the
fragrance of the ointment of holy conversation, on account of whom, reproaching Simon
the leper,—the former people,—He spoke those things which are written.5584</p>

<head>5. Concerning the Leaven of the Pharisees.</head>
<p>“And His disciples came to the other side and forgot to take loaves.”5585 Since the loaves
which they had before they came to the other side were no longer useful to the disciples
when they came to the other side, for they needed one kind of loaves before they crossed
and a different kind when they crossed,—on this account, being careless of taking loaves
when going to the other side, they forgot to take loaves with them. To the other side then
came the disciples of Jesus who had passed over from things material to things spiritual,
and from things sensible to those which are intellectual. And perhaps that He might turn
back those who, by crossing to the other side, “had begun in spirit,”5586 from running back
to carnal things, Jesus said to them when on the other side, “Take heed and beware.”5587
For there was a certain lump of teaching and of truly ancient leaven,—that according to the
bare letter, and on this account not freed from those things which arise from wickedness,—
which the Pharisees and Sadducees offered, of which Jesus does not wish His own
disciples any longer to eat, having made for them a new and spiritual lump, offering Himself
to those who gave up the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees and had come to Him—“the
living bread which came down from heaven and gives life to the world.”5588 But since, to
him who is no longer going to use the leaven and the lump and the teaching of the Pharisees
and the Sadducees, the first thing is to “see” and then to “beware,” so that no one, by reason
of not seeing and from want of taking heed, may ever partake of their forbidden leaven,—on
this account He says to the disciples, first, “see,” and then, “beware.” It is the mark of the
clear-sighted and careful to separate the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees and every
food that is not of “the unleavened-bread of sincerity and truth”5589 from the living bread,
even that which came down from heaven, so that no one who eats may adopt the things of
the Pharisees and the Sadducees, but by eating the living and true bread may strengthen his
soul. And we might seasonably apply the saying to those who, along with the Christian way
of life, prefer to live as the Jews, materially, for these do not see nor beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and Sadducees, but, contrary to the will of Jesus who forbade it, eat the bread
of the Pharisees. Yea and also all, who do not wish to understand that the law is spiritual,
and has a shadow of the good things to come,5590 and is a shadow of the things to come,5591
neither inquire of what good thing about to be each of the laws is a shadow, nor do they see

nor beware of the leaven of the Pharisees; and they also who reject the doctrine of the resurrection
of the dead are not on their guard against the leaven of the Sadducees. And there
are many among the heterodox who, because of their unbelief in regard to the resurrection
of the dead, are imbued with the leaven of the Sadducees. Now, while Jesus said these things,
the disciples reasoned, saying not aloud, but in their own hearts, “We took no loaves.”5592
And something like this was what they said, “If we had loaves we would not have had to
take of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees; but since, from want of loaves, we
run the risk of taking from their leaven, while the Saviour does not wish us to run back to
their teaching, therefore He said to us, “Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
and the Sadducees.””5593 And these things then they reasoned; Jesus, while looking to that
which was in their hearts, and hearing the reasons in them, as the true overseer of hearts,
reproves them because they did not see nor remember the loaves which they received from
Him; on account of which, even when they appeared to be in want of loaves, they did not
need the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</p>

<head>6. The Meaning of Leaven. Jesus’ Knowledge of the Heart.</head>
<p>Then expounding clearly and representing to them, who were being distracted because
of the equivocal meaning of loaf and leaven, in an undisguised fashion, that He was not
speaking to them about sensible bread but about the leaven in the teaching, He subjoins,
“How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake not you concerning bread? But beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”5594 And though He had not laid bare the interpretation,
but still continued to use metaphorical language, the disciples would have understood
that the discourse of the Saviour was about the teaching, figuratively called leaven,
which the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. So long, then, as we have Jesus with us
fulfilling the promise which runs, “Lo, I am with you always unto the consummation of the
age,”5595 we cannot fast nor be in want of food, so that, because of want of it we should desire
to take and eat the forbidden leaven, even from the Pharisees and Sadducees. Now there
may sometimes be a time, when He is with us, that we are without food, as is spoken of in
the passage above, “They continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat;”5596
but, even though this should happen, being unwilling to send us away fasting lest we faint
on the way, He gives thanks over the loaves which were with the disciples, and causes us to
have the seven baskets over from the seven loaves, as we have recorded. And moreover this
also is to be observed, in view of those who think that the divinity of the Saviour is not at
all demonstrable from the Gospel of Matthew, that the fact that, when the disciples were
reasoning among themselves and saying, “We have no loaves,” Jesus knew their reasonings
and said, “Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye took no
loaves,”5597 was beyond the power of man; for the Lord alone, as Solomon says in the third
Book of Kings, knows the hearts of men.5598 But since the disciples understood, when Jesus
said, “Beware of the leaven,”5599 that He did not tell them to beware of the loaves but of the
teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you will understand that whenever leaven is named
it is put figuratively for teaching, whether in the law, or in the Scriptures which come after
the law; and so perhaps leaven is not offered upon the altar; for it is not right that prayers
should take the form of teaching, but should only be supplications of good things from
God. But one might inquire, on account of what has been said about disciples who came
to the other side, if any one who has reached the other side can be reproached as one of little
faith, and as not yet understanding nor remembering what was done by Jesus. But it is not

difficult, I think, to say to this, that in relation to that which is perfect, on the coming of
which “that which is in part shall be done away,”5600 all our faith here is little faith, and in
regard to that, we who know in part do not yet know nor remember; for we are not able to
obtain a memory which is sufficient and able to attain to the magnitude of the nature of the
speculations.</p>

<head>7. Relative Magnitude of Sins of the Heart and Actual Sins.</head>
<p>But we may also learn from this, that in respect of the reasonings only which we reason
within ourselves, we are sometimes convicted and reproached as being of little faith. And
I think that just as a man commits adultery in his heart only, though not proceeding altogether
to the overt act, so he commits in his heart the rest of the things which are forbidden.
As then he who has committed adultery in his heart will be punished proportionately to
adultery of this kind, so also he who has done in his heart any one of the things forbidden,
for example, who has stolen in his heart only, or borne false witness in his heart only, will
not be punished as he who has stolen in fact, or who has completed the very act of false
testimony, but only as he who has done such things in his heart. There is also the case of
the man who while he did not arrive at the evil action, came short of it in spite of his own
will. For if, in addition to willing it, he has attempted it, but not carried it out, he will be
punished not as one who has sinned in his heart alone but in deed. To questions of this sort
one might ask, whether any one commits adultery in his heart, even if he does not do the
deed of adultery, but lacks self-control in heart only. And the like also you will say concerning
the rest of things which are deserving of praise. But the passage possibly contains a plausible
fallacy which must be cleared away, I think, in this manner: adultery which takes place in
the heart is a less sin, than if one were also to add to it the act. But it is impossible that there
can be chastity in the heart, hindering the chaste action—unless indeed one brings forward
for an illustration of this the case of the virgin who according to the law was violated in
solitude;5601 for it may be granted that the heart of any one may be most pure,5602 but that
force in a matter of licentiousness has caused the corruption of the body of her who was
chaste. In truth she seems to me to be altogether chaste in secret heart, but no longer to be
pure in body such as she was before the act of violence; but though she is not pure outwardly,
is she therefore now also unchaste? I have said these things because of the words, “They
reasoned among themselves saying, We took no loaves,” to which is added, “And Jesus
perceiving it, said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves,”5603 etc.; for it was
necessary that investigation should be made in regard to the censure of things in secret and
correlatively to the praise of things in secret.</p>

<head>8. The Leaven Figurative Like the Water Spoken of by Jesus to the Woman of
Samaria.</head>
<p>But I wonder if the disciples thought, before the saying was explained to them by Jesus,
that their Teacher and Lord was forbidding them to beware of the sensible leaven of the
Pharisees or the Sadducees as impure, and on this account forbidden, lest they might use
that leaven because they had not taken loaves. And we might make a like inquiry in regard
to other things; but by-way of illustration the narrative about the woman of Samaria sufficeth,
“Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him shall never thirst.”5604 For there, also, so far as the mere form of ex
pression is concerned, the Samaritan woman would seem to have thought that the Saviour
was giving a promise about sensible water, when He said, “Whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him shall never thirst.” And those things then must be figuratively interpreted,
and we must examine and compare the water of the spring of Jacob from which the
woman of Samaria drew water with the water of Jesus; and here the like must be done; for
perhaps the loaves were not baked, but a kind of raw leaven solely, the teaching, namely, of
the Pharisees and Sadducees.</p>

<head>9. Concerning the Question of Jesus in Cæsarea, Who Do Men Say that I Am?
Different Conceptions of Jesus.</head>
<p>“Now when Jesus came into the parts of Cæsarea Philippi, He asked His disciples.”5605
Jesus inquires of the disciples, “Who do men say that I am,” that we may learn from the
answer of the Apostles the different conceptions then held among the Jews in regard to our
Saviour; and perhaps also that the disciples of Jesus might learn to be interested in knowing
what is said by men about them;5606 because that will be an advantage to them who do it,
by cutting off in every way occasions of evil if anything evil is spoken of, and by increasing
the incitements to good, if anything good is spoken of. Only, observe how, on account of
the different movements of opinion among the Jews about Jesus, some, under the influence
of unsound theories, said that He was John the Baptist, like Herod the tetrarch who said to
his servants, “This is John the Baptist, he is risen from the dead, and therefore do the powers
work in him;”5607 but others that He who was now called Jesus was Elijah, either having
been born a second time, or living from that time in the flesh, and appearing at the present
time. But those who said that Jesus was Jeremiah, and not that Jeremiah was a type of the
Christ, were perhaps influenced by what is said in the beginning of Jeremiah about Christ,
which was not fulfilled in the prophet at that time, but was beginning to be fulfilled in Jesus,
whom “God set up over nations and kingdoms to root up, and to break down, and to destroy,
and to build up, and to transplant,”5608 having made Him to be a prophet to the Gentiles
to whom He proclaimed the word. Moreover also those who said, “that he was a certain
one of the prophets,”5609 conceived this opinion concerning Him because of those things
which had been said in the prophets as unto them, but which had not been fulfilled in their
case. But also the Jews, as worthy of the veil which was upon their heart, held false opinions
concerning Jesus; while Peter as not a disciple “of flesh and blood,”5610 but as one fit to receive
the revelation of the Father in heaven, confessed that He was the Christ. The saying of Peter
to the Saviour, “Thou art the Christ,” when the Jews did not know that He was Christ, was
indeed a great thing, but greater that he knew Him not only to be Christ, but also “the Son
of the living God,”5611 who had also said through the prophets, “I live,”5612 and “They have

forsaken Me the spring of living water;”5613—and He is life also, as from the Father the
spring of life, who said, “I am the Life;”5614 and consider carefully, whether, as the spring
of the river is not the same thing as the river, the spring of life is not the same as life. And
these things we have added because to the saying, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of God,”
was subjoined the word “living;”5615 for it was necessary to set forth something noteworthy
in regard to that which is said about God and the Father of all things as living, both in relation
to His absolute life, and in relation to those things which participate in it. But since we said
that they were under the influence of unsound opinions who declared that Jesus was John
the Baptist, or any one of those named, in saying this let us prove that if they had fallen in
with Jesus as He was going away to John for baptism, or with John when he was baptizing
Jesus, or if they had heard it from any one, they would not have said that Jesus was John.
But also if they had understood the opinions under the influence of which Jesus said, “If ye
are willing to receive it, this is Elijah which is to come,”5616 and had heard what was said,
as men having ears, some would not have said that He was Elijah. And if those who said
that He was Jeremiah had perceived that the most of the prophets took upon themselves
certain features that were symbolical of Him, they would not have said that He was Jeremiah;
and in like manner the others would not have said that He was one of the prophets.</p>

<head>10. The Answer of Peter.</head>
<p>And perhaps that which Simon Peter answered and said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son
of the living God,”5617 if we say it as Peter, not by flesh and blood revealing it unto us, but
by the light from the Father in heaven shining in our heart, we too become as Peter, being
pronounced blessed as he was, because that the grounds on which he was pronounced
blessed apply also to us, by reason of the fact that flesh and blood have not revealed to us
with regard to Jesus that He is Christ, the Son of the living God, but the Father in heaven,
from the very heavens, that our citizenship may be in heaven,5618 revealing to us the revelation
which carries up to heaven those who take away every veil from the heart, and receive
“the spirit of the wisdom and revelation” of God.5619 And if we too have said like Peter,
“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,” not as if flesh and blood had revealed it
unto us, but by light from the Father in heaven having shone in our heart, we become a
Peter, and to us there might be said by the Word, “Thou art Peter,” etc.5620 For a rock5621
is every disciple of Christ of whom those drank who drank of the spiritual rock which followed
them,5622 and upon every such rock is built every word of the church, and the polity
in accordance with it; for in each of the perfect, who have the combination of words and
deeds and thoughts which fill up the blessedness, is the church built by God.</p>

<head>11. The Promise Given to Peter Not Restricted to Him, But Applicable to All Disciples
Like Him.</head>
<p>But if you suppose that upon that one Peter only the whole church is built by God, what
would you say about John the son of thunder or each one of the Apostles? Shall we otherwise
dare to say, that against Peter in particular the gates of Hades shall not prevail, but that they
shall prevail against the other Apostles and the perfect? Does not the saying previously
made, “The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it,”5623 hold in regard to all and in the
case of each of them? And also the saying, “Upon this rock I will build My church”?5624
Are the keys of the kingdom of heaven given by the Lord to Peter only, and will no other of
the blessed receive them? But if this promise, “I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
of heaven,”5625 be common to the others, how shall not all the things previously spoken of,
and the things which are subjoined as having been addressed to Peter, be common to them?
For in this place these words seem to be addressed as to Peter only, “Whatsoever thou shalt
bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,”5626 etc.; but in the Gospel of John the Saviour
having given the Holy Spirit unto the disciples by breathing upon them said, “Receive ye
the Holy Spirit,”5627 etc. Many then will say to the Saviour, “Thou art the Christ, the Son
of the living God;” but not all who say this will say it to Him, as not at all having learned it
by the revelation of flesh and blood but by the Father in heaven Himself taking away the
veil that lay upon their heart, in order that after this “with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror
the glory of the Lord”5628 they may speak through the Spirit of God saying concerning Him,
“Lord Jesus,” and to Him, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”5629 And if any
one says this to Him, not by flesh and blood revealing it unto Him but through the Father
in heaven, he will obtain the things that were spoken according to the letter of the Gospel
to that Peter, but, as the spirit of the Gospel teaches, to every one who becomes such as that
Peter was. For all bear the surname of “rock” who are the imitators of Christ, that is, of the
spiritual rock which followed those who are being saved,5630 that they may drink from it
the spiritual draught. But these bear the surname of the rock just as Christ does. But also
as members of Christ deriving their surname from Him they are called Christians, and from

the rock, Peters. And taking occasion from these things you will say that the righteous bear
the surname of Christ who is Righteousness, and the wise of Christ who is Wisdom.5631
And so in regard to all His other names, you will apply them by way of surname to the saints;
and to all such the saying of the Saviour might be spoken, “Thou art Peter,” etc., down to
the words, “prevail against it.” But what is the “it”? Is it the rock upon which Christ builds
the church, or is it the church? For the phrase is ambiguous. Or is it as if the rock and the
church were one and the same? This I think to be true; for neither against the rock on which
Christ builds the church, nor against the church will the gates of Hades prevail; just as the
way of a serpent upon a rock, according to what is written in the Proverbs,5632 cannot be
found. Now, if the gates of Hades prevail against any one, such an one cannot be a rock
upon which Christ builds the church, nor the church built by Jesus upon the rock; for the
rock is inaccessible to the serpent, and it is stronger than the gates of Hades which are opposing
it, so that because of its strength the gates of Hades do not prevail against it; but the
church, as a building of Christ who built His own house wisely upon the rock,5633 is incapable
of admitting the gates of Hades which prevail against every man who is outside the rock
and the church, but have no power against it.</p>

<head>12. Every Sin—Every False Doctrine is a “Gate of Hades.”</head>
<p>But when we have understood how each of the sins through which there is a way to
Hades5634 is a gate of Hades, we shall apprehend that the soul, which has “spot or wrinkle
or any such thing,”5635 and because of wickedness is neither holy nor blameless, is neither
a rock upon which Christ builds, nor a church, nor part of a church which Christ builds
upon the rock. But if any one wishes to put us5636 to shame in regard to these things because
of the great majority of those of the church who are thought to believe, it must be said to
him not only “Many are called, but few chosen;”5637 but also that which was said by the
Saviour to those who come to Him, as it is recorded in Luke in these words, “Strive to enter
in by the narrow door, for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in through the narrow
door and shall not be able;”5638 and also that which is written in the Gospel of Matthew
thus, “For narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth unto life, and few be they
that find it.”5639 Now, if you attend to the saying, “Many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter
in and shall not be able,”5640 you will understand that this refers to those who boast that
they are of the church, but live weakly and contrary to the word. Of those, then, who seek
to enter in, those who are not able to enter will not be able to do so, because the gates of
Hades prevail against them; but in the case of those against whom the gates of Hades will
not prevail, those seeking to enter in will be strong, being able to do all things, in Christ Jesus,
who strengtheneth them.5641 And in like manner each one of those who are the authors of
any evil opinion has become the architect of a certain gate of Hades; but those who co-operate
with the teaching of the architect of such things are servants and stewards, who are
the bond-servants of the evil doctrine which goes to build up impiety. And though the gates
of Hades are many and almost innumerable, no gate of Hades will prevail against the rock
or against the church which Christ builds upon it. Notwithstanding, these gates have a
certain power by which they gain the mastery over some who do not resist and strive against
them; but they are overcome by others who, because they do not turn aside from Him who
said, “I am the door,”5642 have rased from their soul all the gates of Hades. And this also

we must know that as the gates of cities have each their own names, in the same way the
gates of Hades might be named after the species of sins; so that one gate of Hades is called
“fornication,” through which fornicators go, and another “denial,” through which the deniers
of God go down into Hades. And likewise already each of the heterodox and of those who
have begotten any “knowledge which is falsely so called,”5643 has built a gate of
Hades—Marcion one gate, and Basilides another, and Valentinus another.</p>

<head>13. The “Gates of Hades” And the “Gates of Zion” Contrasted.</head>
<p>In this place, then, the gates of Hades are spoken of; but in the Psalms the prophet gives
thanks saying, “He who lifteth me up from the gates of death that I may declare all thy praises
in the gates of the daughter of Zion.”5644 And from this we learn that it is never possible
for any one to be fit to declare the praises of God, unless he has been lifted up from the gates
of death, and has come to the gates of Zion. Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as
opposed to the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness, but a gate of
Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death, unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, righteousness,
which the prophet shows forth saying, “This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter
into it.”5645 And again there is cowardice, a gate of death, but manly courage, a gate of Zion;
and want of prudence, a gate of death, but its opposite, prudence, a gate of Zion. But to all
the gates of the “knowledge which is falsely so called”5646 one gate is opposed, the gate of
knowledge which is free from falsehood. But consider if, because of the saying , “our
wrestling is not against flesh and blood,”5647 etc., you can say that each power and worldruler
of this darkness, and each one of the “spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly
places”5648 is a gate of Hades and a gate of death. Let, then, the principalities and powers
with which our wrestling is, be called gates of Hades, but the “ministering spirits”5649 gates
of righteousness. But as in the case of the better things many gates are first spoken of, and
after the gates, one, in the passage, “Open to me the gates of righteousness, I will enter into
them, and will make full confession to the Lord,” and “this is the gate of the Lord, by it the
righteous shall enter;”5650 so also in the case of those gates which are opposed, many are
the gates of Hades and death, each a power; but over all these the wicked one himself. And
let us take heed in regard to each sin, as if we were descending into some gate of death if we
sin; but when we are lifted up from the gates of death let us declare all the praises of the
Lord in the gates of the daughter of Zion; as, for example, in one gate of the daughter of
Zion—that which is called self-control—we will declare by our self-control the praises of
God; and in another which is called righteousness, by righteousness we will declare the
praises of God; and, generally, in all things whatsoever of a praiseworthy character with
which we are occupied, in these we are at some gate of the daughter of Zion, declaring at

each gate some praise of God. But we must make inquiry whether in one of the Twelve5651
it is said, “They hated him that reproveth in the gates, and they loathed the holy word.”5652
Perhaps, then, he who reproves in the gates is of the gates of the daughter of Zion, reproving
those who are in sins which are opposed to this gate, even of the gates of Hades or death.
But if ye do not so understand the words, “They hated him that reproveth in the gates,”
either the expression “in the gates” will be held to be superfluous, or investigate how that
which is said can be worthy of the prophetic spirit.</p>

<head>14. In What Sense the “Keys” Are Given to Peter, and Every Peter. Limitations of
This Power.</head>
<p>And after this let us see in what sense it is said to Peter, and to every Peter, “I will give
unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.”5653 And, in the first place, I think that the
saying, “I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,” is spoken in consistency
with the words, “The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.”5654 For he is worthy to
receive from the same Word the keys of the kingdom of heaven, who is fortified against the
gates of Hades so that they do not prevail against him, receiving, as it were, for a prize, the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, because the gates of Hades had no power against him, that
he might open for himself the gates that were closed to those who had been conquered by
the gates of Hades. And he enters in, as a temperate man, through an opened gate—the
gate of temperance—by the key which opens temperance; and, as a righteous man, by another
gate—the gate of righteousness—which is opened by the key of righteousness; and so
with the rest of the virtues. For I think that for every virtue of knowledge certain mysteries
of wisdom corresponding to the species of the virtue are opened up to him who has lived
according to virtue; the Saviour giving to those who are not mastered by the gates of Hades
as many keys as there are virtues, which open gates equal in number, which correspond to
each virtue according to the revelation of the mysteries. And perhaps, also, each virtue is a
kingdom of heaven, and all together are a kingdom of the heavens; so that according to this
he is already in the kingdom of the heavens who lives according to the virtues, so that according
to this the saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,”5655 is to be referred,
not to the time, but to deeds and dispositions; for Christ, who is all virtue, has come,
and speaks, and on account of this the kingdom of God is within His disciples, and not here
or there.5656 But consider how great power the rock has upon which the church is built by
Christ, and how great power every one has who says, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
living God,” so that the judgments of this man abide sure, as if God were judging in him,
that in the very act of judging the gates of Hades shall not prevail against him. But when
one judges unrighteously, and does not bind upon earth according to the Word of God, nor
loose upon earth according to His will, the gates of Hades prevail against him; but, in the
case of any one against whom the gates of Hades do not prevail, this man judges righteously.
Wherefore he has the keys of the kingdom of heaven, opening to those who have been loosed

<pb n="898"/>
on earth that they may be also loosed in heaven, and free; and shutting to those who by his
just judgment have been bound on earth that they also may be bound in heaven, and condemned.
But when those who maintain the function of the episcopate make use of this
word as Peter, and, having received the keys of the kingdom of heaven from the Saviour,
teach that things bound by them, that is to say, condemned, are also bound in heaven, and
that those which have obtained remission by them are also loosed in heaven, we must say
that they speak wholesomely if they have the way of life on account of which it was said to
that Peter, “Thou art Peter;”5657 and if they are such that upon them the church is built by
Christ, and to them with good reason this could be referred; and the gates of Hades ought
not to prevail against him when he wishes to bind and loose. But if he is tightly bound with
the cords of his sins,5658 to no purpose does he bind and loose. And perhaps you can say
that in the heavens which are in the wise man—that, is the virtues,—the bad man is bound;
and again in these the virtuous man is loosed, and has received an indemnity for the sins
which he committed before his virtue. But, as the man, who has not the cords of sins nor
iniquities compared to a “long rope or to the strap of the yoke of a heifer,”5659 not even God
could bind, in like manner, no Peter, whoever he may be; and if any one who is not a Peter,
and does not possess the things here spoken of, imagines as a Peter that he will so bind on
earth that the things bound are bound in heaven, and will so loose on earth that the things
loosed are loosed in heaven, he is puffed up, not understanding the meaning of the Scriptures,
and, being puffed up, has fallen into the ruin of the devil.5660</p>

<head>15. Relation of the Former Commission Given by Jesus to the Disciples, to His
Present Injunction of Silence. Belief and Knowledge Contrasted.</head>
<p>“Then enjoined He His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ.”5661
It is written above that Jesus sent forth these twelve saying unto them, “Go not into any way
of the Gentiles,”5662 and the other words which are recorded to have been said to them
when He sent them to the apostleship. Did He then wish them when they were already
discharging the function of Apostles to proclaim that He was the Christ? For, if He wished
it, it is fitting to inquire why He now at all commands the disciples that they should not say
that He was the Christ? Or if He did not wish it, how can the things concerning the
apostleship be safely maintained? And these things also one may inquire at this
place,—whether, when He sent away the Twelve, He did not send them away with the understanding
that He was the Christ? But if the Twelve had such understanding, manifestly
Peter had it also; how, then, is he now pronounced blessed? For the expression here plainly
indicates that now for the first time Peter confessed that Christ was the Son of the living
God. Matthew then, according to some of the manuscripts, has written, “Then He commanded
His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ,” but5663 Mark
says, “He charged them that they should tell no man of Him;”5664 and Luke, “He charged
them and commanded them to tell this to no man.”5665 But what is the “this”? Was it that
also according to him, Peter answered and said to the question, “Who say ye that I
am.”—“The Christ, the Son of the living God?”5666 You must know, however, that some
manuscripts of the Gospel according to Matthew have, “He charged.”5667 The difficulty
thus started seems to me a very real difficulty; but let a solution which cannot be impugned
be sought out, and let the finder of it bring it forward before all, if it be more credible than
that which shall be advanced by us as a fairly temperate view.5668 Consider, then, if you
can say, that the belief that Jesus is the Christ is inferior to the knowledge of that which is
believed. And perhaps also there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as
every one who knows does not know Him alike. From the words in John, “If ye abide in
My word, ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,”5669 it is plain that

<pb n="900"/>
belief without knowledge is inferior to knowing; but that there is a difference in the knowledge
of Jesus as the Christ, as all who know Him do not know Him equally, is a fact self-evident
to any one who gives even a very little consideration to the matter. For who would not acknowledge,
for example, that Timothy, though he knew that Jesus was the Christ, had not
been enlightened to such an extent in the knowledge of Him as the Apostle had been en-
lightened? And who would not also admit this—that though many, speaking the truth, say
about God, “He has given to me a true knowledge of things that are,” yet they will not say
this with equal insight and apprehension of the things known, nor as knowing the same
number of things? But it is not only in respect of the difference of knowing that those who
know do not know alike, but also according to that which is the source of the knowledge;
so that according to this he who knows the Son by the revelation of the Father,5670 as Peter
is testified to have known, has the highest beatitude. Now, if these views of ours are sound,
you will consider whether the Twelve formerly believed but did not know; but, after believing,
they gained also the rudiments of knowledge and knew a few things about Him; and afterwards
they continued to advance in knowledge so that they were able to receive the knowledge
from the Father who reveals the Son; in which position Peter was, when he was pronounced
blessed; for also he is pronounced blessed not merely because he said, “Thou art the Christ,”
but with the addition, “the Son of the living God.” Accordingly Mark and Luke who have
recorded that Peter answered and said, “Thou art the Christ,” but have not given the addition
found in Matthew, have not recorded that he was declared blessed for what had been said,
nor the blessing which followed the declaration of blessedness, “Thou art Peter,”5671 etc.</p>

<head>16. Gradual Growth in Knowledge of the Disciples.</head>
<p>But now we must first investigate the fact that they were declaring other things about
Him as being great and wonderful, but did not yet proclaim that He was the Christ, lest the
Saviour may not appear to take away from them the authority to announce that He was the
Christ, which He had formerly bestowed upon them. And perhaps some one will support
an argument of this kind, saying that on their introduction into the school of Christ the
Jews were taught by the disciples glorious things about Jesus, so that in due season there
might be built upon these as a foundation the things about Jesus being the Christ; and perhaps
many of the things which were said to them were said to all who virtually believed; for not
to the Apostles alone did the saying apply, “Before governors and kings also shall ye be
brought for My sake for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles;”5672 and perhaps also not
to the Apostles absolutely, but to all who were about to believe the word, “And brother shall
deliver up brother to death,”5673 etc.; but, “Whosoever shall confess Me,”5674 etc., is said
not specially to the Apostles, but also to all believers. According to this, then, through that
which was said to the Apostles an outline was given beforehand of the teaching which would
afterwards come to be of service both to them and to every teacher.</p>

<p>And likewise he who holds that the fact that He was Christ had been formerly proclaimed
by the Apostles when they heard the saying, “What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in
the light, and what ye hear in the ear proclaim on the housetops,”5675 will say, that He wished
first to give catechetical instruction as it were to those of the Apostles who were to hear the
name of Christ, then to permit this, so to speak, to be digested in the minds of the hearers,
that, after there had been a period of silence in the proclamation of something of this kind
about Him, at a more seasonable time there might be built up upon the former rudiments
“Christ Jesus crucified and raised from the dead,” which at the beginning not even the
Apostles knew; for it is written in the passage now under consideration, “From that time
began Jesus to show unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem”5676 and suffer this
and that. But if now, for the first time, the Apostles learn from Jesus the things that were
about to happen unto Him, namely, that the elders will plot against Him, and that He will
be killed, and that after these things, on the third day, He will rise from the dead,—what
necessity is there for supposing that those who had been taught by the Apostles concerning
Jesus knew them before, or that although Christ was announced to them He was announced
to them by way of an introduction which did not clearly elucidate the things concerning
Him? For our Saviour wished, when He enjoined the disciples to tell no man that He was
the Christ, to reserve the more perfect teaching about Him to a more fitting time, when to
those who had seen Him crucified, the disciples who had seen Him crucified and risen could
testify the things relating to His resurrection. For if the Apostles, who were always with
Him and had seen all the wonderful things which He did, and who bore testimony to His
words that they were words of eternal life,5677 were offended on the night on which He was
betrayed,—what do you suppose would have been the feelings of those who had formerly
learned that He was the Christ? To spare them, I think, He gave this command.</p>

<head>18. Jesus Was at First Proclaimed by the Twelve as a Worker and a Teacher Only.</head>
<p>But he who holds that the things spoken to the Twelve refer to the times subsequent to
this, and that the Apostles had not as yet announced to their hearers that He was the Christ,
will say that He wished the conception of the Christ which was involved in the name of Jesus
to be reserved for that preaching which was more perfect, and which brought salvation,
such as Paul knew of when he said to the Corinthians, “I determined not to know anything
among you save Jesus Christ and Him crucified.”5678 Wherefore, formerly they proclaimed
Jesus as the doer of certain things, and the teacher of certain things; but now when Peter
confesses that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God, as He did not wish it to be proclaimed
already that He was the Christ, in order that He might be proclaimed at a more
suitable time, and that as crucified, He commands His disciples that they should tell no man
that He was the Christ. And that this was His meaning, when He forbade proclamation to
be made that He was the Christ, is in a measure established by the words, “From that time
began Jesus to show unto His disciples how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer
many things of the elders,” and what is annexed;5679 for then, at the fitting time, He proclaims,
so to speak, to the disciples who knew that Jesus was Christ, the Son of the living
God, the Father having revealed it to them, that instead of believing in Jesus Christ who had
been crucified, they were to believe in Jesus Christ who was about to be crucified. But also,
instead of believing in Christ Jesus and Him risen from the dead, He teaches them to believe
in Christ Jesus and Him about to be risen from the dead. But since “having put off from
Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing
over in the cross,”5680 if any one is ashamed of the cross of Christ, he is ashamed of the
dispensation on account of which these powers were triumphed over; and it is fitting that
he, who both believes and knows these things, should glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ,5681 through which, when Christ was crucified, the principalities—among which, I
think, was also the prince of this world—were made a show of and triumphed over before
the believing world. Wherefore, when His suffering was at hand he said, “Now the prince
of this world has been judged,”5682 and, “Now shall the prince of this world be cast out,”
and, “I, if I be lifted from the earth, will draw all men unto Myself;”5683 as he no longer had
sufficient power to prevent those going to Jesus who were being drawn by Him.</p>

<head>19. Importance of the Proclamation of Jesus as the Crucified.​</head>
<p>It is necessary, therefore, to the proclamation of Jesus as Christ, that He should be proclaimed
as crucified; and the proclamation that Jesus was the Christ does not seem to me
so defective when any of His other miracles is passed over in silence, as when the fact of His
crucifixion is passed over. Wherefore, reserving the more perfect proclamation of the things
concerning Him by the Apostles, He commanded His disciples that they should tell no man
that He was the Christ; and He prepared them to say that He was the Christ crucified and
risen from the dead, “when He began” not only to say, nor even to advance to the point of
teaching merely, but “to show”5684 to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, etc.; for
attend to the expression “show”; because just as sensible things are said to be shown so the
things spoken by Him to His disciples are said to be shown by Jesus. And I do not think
that each of the things seen was shown to those who saw Him suffering many things in body
from the elders of the people, with such clearness as was the rational demonstration about
Him to the disciples.</p>

<head>20. Why Jesus Had to Go to Jerusalem.</head>
<p>“Then began He to show;”5685 and probably afterwards when they were able to receive
it He shewed more clearly, no longer beginning to show as to those who were learning the
introduction, but already also advancing in the showing; and if it is reasonable to conceive
that Jesus altogether completed what He began, then, some time, He altogether completed
that which He began to show to His disciples about the necessity of His suffering the things
which are written. For, when any one apprehends from the Word the perfect knowledge
of these things, then it must be said that, from a rational exhibition (the mind seeing the
things which are shown,) the exhibition becomes complete for him who has the will and
the power to contemplate these things, and does contemplate them. But since “it cannot
be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem,”5686—a perishing which corresponds to the words,
“He that loseth his life for My sake shall find it,”5687—on this account it was necessary for
Him to go to Jerusalem, that having suffered many things in that Jerusalem, He might make
“the first-fruits”5688 of the resurrection from the dead in the Jerusalem above, doing away
with and breaking up the city upon the earth with all the worship which was maintained in
it. For so long as Christ “had not been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of them that are
asleep,”5689 and those who become conformed to His death and resurrection had not yet
been raised along with Him, the city of God was sought for below, and the temple, and the
purifications, and the rest; but when this took place, no longer were the things below sought
for, but the things above; and, in order that these might be set up, it was necessary that He
should go unto the Jerusalem below, and there suffer many things from the elders in it, and
the chief priests and scribes of the people, in order that He might be glorified by the heavenly
elders who could receive his bounties, and by diviner high-priests who are ordained under
the one High-Priest, and that He might be glorified by the scribes of the people who are
occupied with letters “not written with ink”5690 but made clear by the Spirit of the living
God, and might be killed in the Jerusalem below, and having risen from the dead might
reign in Mount Zion, and the city of the living God—the heavenly Jerusalem.5691 But on
the third day He rose from the dead,5692 in order that having delivered them from the wicked

opposed to that which Christ is, and also from the profane spirit who transforms himself

<head>21. The Rebuke of Peter and the Answer of Jesus.</head>
<p>“And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be propitious to Thee. Lord,
this shall never be unto thee.”5694 To whom He said, “Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art
a stumbling-block unto Me; for thou mindest not the things of God but the things of men.”5695
Since Jesus had begun to show unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer
many things, Peter up to this point learned the beginnings of those things which were
shown.5696 But since he thought that the sufferings were unworthy of Christ the Son of the
living God, and below the dignity of the Father who had revealed to him so great things
about Christ,—for the things that concerned His coming suffering had not been revealed
to him,—on this account he took Him, and as one forgetful of the honour due to the Christ,
and that the Son of the living God neither does nor says anything worthy of rebuke, he began
to rebuke Him; and as to one who needed propitiation,—for he did not yet know that “God
had set Him forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood,”5697 he said, “God be
propitious to thee, O Lord.”5698 Approving his purpose, indeed, but rebuking his ignorance,
because of the purpose being right, He says to him, “Get thee behind Me,”5699 as to one
who, by reason of the things of which he was ignorant and spake not rightly, had abandoned
the following of Jesus; but because of his ignorance, as to one who had something antagonistic
to the things of God, He said, “Satan,” which in the Hebrew means “adversary.” But,
if Peter had not spoken from ignorance, nor rebuked the Son of the living God, saying unto
Him, “God be propitious to thee, Lord, this shall never be unto Thee,” Christ would not
have said to him, “Get thee behind Me,” as to one who had given up being behind Him and
following Him; nor would He have said as to one who had spoken things adverse to what
He had said, “Satan.” But now Satan prevailed over him who had followed Jesus and was
going behind Him, to turn aside from following Him and from being behind the Son of
God, and to make him, by reason of the words which he spoke in ignorance, worthy of being
called “Satan” and a stumbling-block to the Son of God, and “as not minding the things of
God but the things of men.” But that Peter was formerly behind the Son of God, before he
committed this sin, is manifest from the words, “Come ye behind Me, and I will make you
fishers of men.”5700</p>

<head>22. Importance of the Expressions “Behind” And “Turned.”</head>
<p>But you will compare together His saying to Peter, “Get thee behind me, Satan,”5701
with that said to the devil (who said to Him, “All these things will I give Thee if Thou wilt
fall down and worship me”),5702 “get thee hence,”5703 without the addition, “behind Me;”
for to be behind Jesus is a good thing. Wherefore it was said, “Come ye behind Me and I
will make you fishers of men.”5704 And to the same effect is the saying, “He that doth not
take his cross and follow behind Me is not worthy of Me.”5705 And as a general principle
observe the expression “behind”; because it is a good thing when any one goes behind the
Lord God and is behind the Christ; but it is the opposite when any one casts the words of
God behind him, or when he transgresses the commandment which says, “Do not walk behind
thy lusts.”5706 And Elijah also, in the third Book of Kings, says to the people, “How
long halt ye on both your knees? If God is the Lord, go behind Him, but if Baal is the Lord,
go behind him.”5707 And Jesus says this to Peter when He “turned,” and He does so by way
of conferring a favour. And if therefore you will collect more illustrations of the “having
turned,” and especially those which are ascribed to Jesus, and compare them with one another,
you would find that the expression is not superfluous. But it is sufficient at present
to bring forward this from the Gospel according to John, “Jesus turned and beheld
them”—clearly, Peter and Andrew—“following, and saith unto them, What seek ye?”5708
For observe that, when He “turned,” it is for the advantage of those to whom He turned.</p>

<head>23. Peter as a Stumbling-Block to Jesus.</head>
<p>Next we must inquire how He said to Peter, “Thou art a stumbling-block unto Me,”5709
especially when David says, “Great peace have they that love Thy law, and there is no
stumbling-block to them.”5710 For some one will say, if this is said in the prophet, because
of the steadfastness of those who have love, and are incapable of being offended, for “love
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things, love never
faileth,”5711 how did the Lord Himself, “who upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all that
be bowed down,”5712 say to Peter, “Thou art a stumbling-block unto Me”? But it must be
said that not only the Saviour, but also he who is perfected in love, cannot be offended. But,
so far as it depends on himself, he who says or does such things is a stumbling-block even
to him who will not be offended; unless perhaps Jesus calls the disciple who sinned a stumbling-
block even to Himself, as much more than Paul He would have said from love, “Who
is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I burn not?”5713 In harmony
with which we may put, “Who is made to stumble, and I am not made to stumble?” But if
Peter, at that time because of the saying, “God be propitious to Thee, Lord, this shall not be
unto Thee,”5714 was called a stumbling-block by Jesus, as not minding the things of God in
what he said but the things of men, what is to be said about all those who profess to be made
disciples of Jesus, but do not mind the things of God, and do not look to things unseen and
eternal, but mind the things of man, and look to things seen and temporal,5715 but that such
still more would be stigmatized by Jesus as a stumbling-block to Him, and because stumblingblocks
to Him, as stumbling-blocks to His brethren also? As in regard to them He says, “I
was thirsty and ye gave Me no drink,”5716 etc., so also He might say, “When I was running
ye caused Me to stumble.” Let us not therefore suppose that it is a trivial sin to mind the
things of men, since we ought in everything to mind the things of God. And it will be appropriate
also to say this to every one that has fallen away from the doctrines of God and
the words of the church and a true mind; as, for example, to him who minds as true the
teaching of Basilides, or Valentinus, or Marcion, or any one of those who teach the things
of men as the things of God.</p>

<head>24. Self-Denial and Cross-Bearing.</head>
<p>“Then Jesus said to His disciples, If any man wills to follow after Me,” etc.5717 He shows
by these words that, to will to come after Jesus and to follow Him, springs from no ordinary
manly courage, and that no one who has not denied himself can come after Jesus. And the
man denies himself who wipes out by a striking revolution his own former life which had
been spent in wickedness; as by way of illustration he who was once licentious denies his
licentious self, having become self-controlled even abidingly. But it is probable that some
one may put the objection, whether as he denied himself so he also confesses himself, when
he denied himself, the unjust, and confesses himself, the righteous one. But, if Christ is
righteousness, he who has received righteousness confesses not himself but Christ; so also
he who has found wisdom, by the very possession of wisdom, confesses Christ. And such
a one indeed as, “with the heart believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth maketh
confession unto salvation,”5718 and bears testimony to the works of Christ, as making confession
by all these things of Christ before men, will be confessed by Him before His Father
in heaven.5719 So also he who has not denied himself but denied the Christ will experience
the saying, “I also will deny him.”5720 On this account let every thought and every purpose
and every word and every action become a denial of ourselves, but a testimony about Christ
and in Christ; for I am persuaded that every action of the perfect man is a testimony to
Christ Jesus, and that abstinence from every sin is a denial of self, leading him after Christ.
And such an one is crucified with Christ, and taking up his own cross follows Him who for
our sakes bears His own cross, according to that which is said in John: “They took Jesus
therefore and put it on Him,” etc., down to the words, “Where they crucified Him.”5721
But the Jesus according to John, so to speak, bears the cross for Himself, and bearing it went
out; but the Jesus according to Matthew and Mark and Luke, does not bear it for Himself,
for Simon of Cyrene bears it.5722 And perhaps this man refers to us, who because of Jesus
take up the cross of Jesus, but Jesus Himself takes it upon Himself; for there are, as it were,
two conceptions of the cross, the one which Simon of Cyrene bears, and the other which
Jesus Himself bears for Himself.</p>

<head>25. Reference to the Saying of Paul About Crucifixion with Christ.</head>
<p>Moreover in regard to the saying, “Let him deny himself,”5723 the following saying of
Paul who denied himself seems appropriate, “Yet I live, and yet no longer I but Christ liveth
in me;”5724 for the expression, “I live, yet no longer I,” was the voice of one denying himself,
as of one who had laid aside his own life and taken on himself the Christ, in order that He
might live in him as Righteousness, and as Wisdom, and as Sanctification, and as our
Peace,5725 and as the Power of God, who worketh all things in him. But further also, attend
to this, that while there are many forms of dying, the Son of God was crucified, being hanged
on a tree, in order that all who die unto sin may die to it, in no other way than by the way
of the cross. Wherefore they will say, “I have been crucified with Christ,” and, “Far be it
from me to glory save in the cross of the Lord, through which the world has been crucified
unto me and I unto the world.”5726 For perhaps also each of those who have been crucified
with Christ puts off from himself the principalities and the powers, and makes a show of
them and triumphs over them in the cross;5727 or rather, Christ does these things in them.</p>

<head>26. The Less of Life; And the Saving of It.</head>
<p>“For whosoever would save his own life shall lose it.”5728 The first expression is ambiguous;
for it may be understood in one way thus. If any one as being a lover of life, and
thinking that the present life is good, tends carefully his own life with a view to living in the
flesh, being afraid to die, as through death going to lose it, this man, by the very willing to
save in this way his own life will lose it, placing it outside of the borders of blessedness. But
if any one despising the present life because of my word, which has persuaded him to strive
in regard to eternal life even unto death for truth, loses his own life, surrendering it for the
sake of piety to that which is commonly called death, this man, as for my sake he has lost
his life, will save it rather, and keep it in possession. And according to a second way we
might interpret the saying as follows. If any one, who has grasped what salvation really is,
wishes to procure the salvation of his own life, let this man having taken farewell of this life,
and denied himself and taken up his own cross, and following me, lose his own life to the
world; for having lost it for my sake and for the sake of all my teaching, he will gain the end
of loss of this kind—salvation.</p>

<head>27. Life Lost to the World is Saved.</head>
<p>But at the same time also observe that at the beginning it is said, “Whosoever wills,” but
afterwards, “Whoso shall lose.”5729 If we then wish it to be saved let us lose it to the world,
as those who have been crucified with Christ and have for our glorying that which is in the
cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world is to be crucified unto us and we
unto the world,5730 that we may gain our end, even the salvation of our lives, which begins
from the time when we lose it for the sake of the word. But if we think that the salvation of
our life is a blessed thing, with reference to the salvation which is in God and the blessednesses
with Him, then any loss of life ought to be a good thing, and, for the sake of Christ must
prove to be the prelude to the blessed salvation. It seems to me, therefore, following the
analogy of self-denial, according to what has been said, that each ought to lose his own life.
Let each one therefore lose his own sinning life, that having lost that which is sinful, he may
receive that which is saved by right actions; but a man will in no way be profited if he shall
gain the whole world. Now he gains the world, I think, to whom the world is not crucified;
and to whom the world is not crucified, to that man shall be the loss of his own life. But
when two things are put before us, either by gaining one’s life to forfeit the world, or by
gaining the world to forfeit one’s life, much more desirable is the choice, that we should
forfeit the world and gain our life by losing it on account of Christ.</p>

<head>28. The Exchange for One’s Life.</head>
<p>But the saying, “What shall a man give in exchange for his own life,”5731 if spoken by
way of interrogation, will seem to be able to indicate that an exchange for his own life is
given by the man who after his sins has given up his whole substance, that his property may
feed the poor, as if he were going by that to obtain salvation; but, if spoken affirmatively, I
think, to indicate that there is not anything in man by the giving of which in exchange for
his own life which has been overcome by death, he will ransom it out of its hand. A man,
therefore, could not give anything as an exchange for his own life, but God gave an exchange
for the life of us all, “the precious blood of Christ Jesus,”5732 according as “we were bought
with a price,”5733 “having been redeemed, not with corruptible things as silver or gold, but
with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,” even of Christ.5734
And in Isaiah it is said to Israel, “I gave Ethiopia in exchange for thee, and Egypt and Syene
for thee; from what time thou hast become honourable before Me thou wast glorified.”5735
For the exchange, for example, of the first-born of Israel was the first-born of the Egyptians,
and the exchange for Israel was the Egyptians who died in the last plagues that came upon
Egypt, and in the drowning which took place after the plagues. But, from these things, let
him who is able inquire whether the exchange of the true Israel given by God, “who redeems
Israel from all his transgressions,”5736 is the true Ethiopia, and, so to speak, spiritual Egypt,
and Syene of Egypt; and to inquire with more boldness, perhaps Syene is the exchange for
Jerusalem, and Egypt for Judæa, and Ethiopia for those who fear, who are different from
Israel, and the house of Levi, and the house of Aaron.</p>

<head>29. The Coming of the Son of Man in Glory.</head>
<p>“For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His own Father with His angels.”5737 Now,
indeed, the Son of man has not come in His glory; “for we saw Him, and He had no form
nor beauty; but His form was dishonoured and defective compared with the sons of men;
He was a man in affliction and toil, and acquainted with the enduring of sickness, because
His face was turned away, He was dishonoured and not esteemed.”5738 And it was necessary
that He should come in such form that He might bear our sins5739 and suffer pain for us;
for it did not become Him in glory to bear our sins and suffer pain for us. But He also comes
in glory, having prepared5740 the disciples through that epiphany of His which has no form
nor beauty; and, having become as they that they might become as He, “conformed to the
image of His glory,”5741 since He formerly became conformed to “the body of our humiliation,”
5742 when He “emptied Himself and took upon Him the form of a servant,”5743 He
is restored to the image of God and also makes them conformed unto it.</p>

<head>30. The Word Appears in Different Forms; The Time of His Coming in Glory.</head>
<p>But if you will understand the differences of the Word which by “the foolishness of
preaching”5744 is proclaimed to those who believe, and spoken in wisdom to them that are
perfect, you will see in what way the Word has the form of a slave to those who are learning
the rudiments, so that they say, “We saw Him and He had no form or beauty.”5745 But to
the perfect He comes “in the glory of His own Father,”5746 who might say, “and we beheld
His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”5747
For indeed to the perfect appears the glory of the Word, and the only-begotten of God His
Father, and the fulness of grace and likewise of truth, which that man cannot perceive who
requires the “foolishness of the preaching,” in order to believe. But “the Son of man shall
come in the glory of His own Father” not alone, but “with His own angels.” And if you can
conceive of all those who are fellow-helpers in the glory of the Word, and in the revelation
of the Wisdom which is Christ, coming along with Him, you will see in what way the Son
of man comes in the glory of His own Father with His own angels. And consider whether
you can in this connection say that the prophets who formerly suffered in virtue of their
word having “no form or beauty” had an analogous position to the Word who had “no form
or beauty.” And, as the Son of man comes in the glory of His own Father, so the angels,
who are the words in the prophets, are present with Him preserving the measure of their
own glory. But when the Word comes in such form with His own angels, He will give to
each a part of His own glory and of the brightness of His own angels, according to the action
of each. But we say these things not rejecting even the second coming of the Son of God
understood in its simpler form. But when shall these things happen? Shall it be when that
apostolic oracle is fulfilled which says, “For we must all stand before the judgment-seat of
Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has
done, whether it be good or bad?”5748 But if He will render to each according to his deed,
not the good deed only, nor the evil apart from the good, it is manifest that He will render
to each according to every evil, and according to every good, deed. But I suppose—in this
also following the Apostle, but comparing also the sayings of Ezekiel, in which the sins of
him who is a perfect convert are wiped out, and the former uprightness of him who has utterly
fallen away is not held of account—that in the case of him who is perfected, and has altogether
laid aside wickedness, the sins are wiped out, but that, in the case of him who has
altogether revolted from piety, if anything good was formerly done by him, it is not taken

into account.5749 But to us, who occupy a middle position between the perfect man and
the apostate, when we stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,5750 there is rendered what
we have done, whether good or bad; for we have not been so pure that our evil deeds are
not at all imputed unto us, nor have we fallen away to such an extent that our better actions
are forgotten.</p>

<head>31. The Simpler Interpretation of the Promise About Not Tasting of Death.</head>
<p>“Verily I say unto you there be some of them that stand here that shall not taste of
death.”5751 Some refer these things to the going up—six days after, or, as Luke says,5752
eight days—of the three disciples into the high mountain with Jesus apart; and those who
adopt this interpretation say that Peter and the remaining two did not taste of death before
they saw the Son of man coming in His own kingdom and in His own glory. For when they
saw Jesus transfigured before them so that “His face shone,” etc., “they saw the kingdom of
God coming with power.”5753 For even as some spear-bearers stand around a king, so
Moses and Elijah appeared to those who had gone up into the mountains, talking with Jesus.
But it is worth while considering whether the sitting on the right hand and on the left hand
of the Saviour in His kingdom refers to them, so that the words, “But for whom it is prepared,”
were5754 spoken because of them. Now this interpretation about the three Apostles
not tasting of death until they have seen Jesus transfigured, is adapted to those who are
designated by Peter as “new-born babes longing for the reasonable milk which is without
guile,”5755 to whom Paul says, “I have fed you with milk, not with meat,”5756 etc. Now, too,
every interpretation of a text which is able to build up those who cannot receive greater
truths might reasonably be called milk, flowing from the holy ground of the Scriptures,
which flows with milk and honey. But he who has been weaned, like Isaac,5757 worthy of
the good cheer and reception which Abraham gave at the weaning of his son, would seek
here and in every Scripture food which is different, I think, from that which is meat, indeed,
but is not solid food, and from what are figuratively called herbs, which are food to one who
has been weaned and is not yet strong but weak, according to the saying, “He that is weak
eateth herbs.”5758 In like manner also he who has been weaned, like Samuel, and dedicated
by his mother to God,5759—she was Hannah, which is, by interpretation, grace,—would be
also a son of grace, seeking, like one nurtured in the temple, flesh of God, the holy food of
those who are at once perfect and priests.</p>

<head>32. Standing by the Saviour.</head>
<p>The reflections in regard to the passage before us that occur to us at the present time
are these: Some were standing where Jesus was, having the footsteps of the soul firmly
planted with Jesus, and the standing of their feet was akin to the standing of which Moses
said in the passage, “And I stood on the mountain forty days and forty nights,”5760 who was
deemed worthy to have it said to him by God who asked him to stand by Him, “But stand
thou here with Me.”5761 Those who really stand by Jesus—that is, by the Word of God—do
not all stand equally; for among those who stand by Jesus are differences from each other.
Wherefore, not all who stand by the Saviour, but some of them as standing better, do not
taste of death until they shall have seen the Word who dwelt with men, and on that account
called Son of man, coming in His own kingdom; for Jesus does not always come in His own
kingdom when He comes, since to the newly initiated He is such that they might say, beholding
the Word Himself not glorious nor great, but inferior to many among them, “We saw
Him, and He had no form or beauty, but His form was dishonoured, defective compared
with all the sons of men.”5762 And these things will be said by those who beheld His glory
in connection with their own former times, when at first the Word as understood in the
synagogue had no form nor beauty to them. To the Word, therefore, who has assumed
most manifestly the power above all words, there belongs a royal dignity which is visible to
some of those who stand by Jesus, when they have been able to follow Him as He goes before
them and ascends to the lofty mountain of His own manifestation. And of this honour
some of those who stand by Jesus are deemed worthy if they be either a Peter against whom
the gates of Hades do not prevail, or the sons of thunder,5763 and are begotten of the mighty
voice of God who thunders and cries aloud from heaven great things to those who have ears
and are wise. Such at least do not taste death.</p>

<head>33. Interpretation of “Tasting of Death.”</head>
<p>But we must seek to understand what is meant by “tasting of death.” And He is life who
says, “I am the life,”5764 and this life assuredly has been hidden with Christ in God; and.
“when Christ our life shall be manifested, then along with Him”5765 shall be manifested
those who are worthy of being manifested with Him in glory. But the enemy of this life,
who is also the last enemy of all His enemies that shall be destroyed, is death,5766 of which
the soul that sinneth dies, having the opposite disposition to that which takes place in the
soul that lives uprightly, and in consequence of living uprightly lives. And when it is said
in the law, “I have placed life before thy face,”5767 the Scripture says this about Him who
said, “I am the Life,” and about His enemy, death; the one or other of which each of us by
his deeds is always choosing. And when we sin with life before our face, the curse is fulfilled
against us which says, “And thy life shall be hanging up before thee,” etc., down to the words,
“and for the sights of thine eyes which thou shalt see.”5768 As, therefore, the Life is also the
living bread which came down from heaven and gave life to the world,5769 so His enemy
death is dead bread. Now every rational soul is fed either on living bread or dead bread, by
the opinions good or bad which it receives. As then in the case of more common foods it
is the practice at one time only to taste them, and at another to eat of them more largely; so
also, in the case of these loaves, one eats insufficiently only tasting them, but another is satiated,—
he that is good or is on the way to being good with the living bread which came down
from heaven, but he that is wicked with the dead bread, which is death; and some perhaps
sparingly, and sinning a little, only taste of death; but those who have attained to virtue do
not even taste of it, but are always fed on the living bread. It naturally followed then in the
case of Peter, against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, that he did not taste of death,
since any one tastes of death and eats death at the time when the gates of Hades prevail
against him; and one eats or tastes of death in proportion as the gates of Hades to a greater
or less extent, more or fewer in number, prevail against him. But also for the sons of thunder
who were begotten of thunder, which is a heavenly thing, it was impossible to taste of death,
which is extremely far removed from thunder, their mother. But these things the Word
prophesies to those who shall be perfected, and who by standing with the Word advanced
so far that they did not taste of death, until they saw the manifestation and the glory and
the kingdom and the excellency of the Word of God in virtue of which He excels every word,

<pb n="922"/>
<head>34. Meaning of “Until.” No Limitation of Promise.</head>
<p>But since some one may think that the promise of the Saviour prescribes a limit of time
to their not tasting of death, namely, that they will not taste of death “until”5770 they see the
Son of man coming in His own kingdom, but after this will taste of it, let us show that according
to the scriptural usage the word “until” signifies that the time concerning the thing
signified is pressing, but is not so defined that after the “until,” that which is contrary to the
thing signified should at all take place. Now, the Saviour says to the eleven disciples when
He rose from the dead, this among other things, “Lo, I am with you all the days, even until
the consummation of the age.”5771 When He said this, did He promise that He was going
to be with them until the consummation of the age, but that after the consummation of the
age, when another age was at hand, which is “called the age to come,” He would be no longer
with them?—so that according to this, the condition of the disciples would be better before
the consummation of the age than after the consummation of the age? But I do not think
that any one will dare to say, that after the consummation of the age the Son of God will be
no longer with the disciples, because the expression declares that He will be with them for
so long, until the consummation of the age is at hand; for it is clear that the matter under
inquiry was, whether the Son of God was forthwith going to be with His disciples before
the age to come and the hoped for promises of God which were given as a recompense. But
there might have been a question—it being granted that He would be with them—whether
sometimes He was present with them, and sometimes not present. Wherefore setting us
free from the suspicion that might have arisen from doubt, He declared that now and even
all the days He would be with the disciples, and that He would not leave those who had become
His disciples until the consummation of the age; (because He said “all the days” He
did not deny that by night, when the sun set, He would be present with them.) But if such
is the force of the words, “until the consummation of the age,” plainly we shall not be compelled
to admit that those who see the Son of man coming in His own kingdom shall taste
of death, after being deemed worthy of beholding Him in such guise. But as in the case of
the passage we brought forward, the urgent necessity was to teach us that “until the consummation
of the age” He would not leave us but be with us all the days; so also in this case I
think that it is clear to those who know how to look at the logical coherence of things that
He who has seen once for all “the Son of man coming in His own kingdom,” and seen Him
“in His own glory,” and seen “the kingdom of God come with power,” could not possibly
taste of death after the contemplation of things so good and great. But apart from the word
of the promise of Jesus, we have conjectured not without reason that we would taste of death,
<note type="footnote">5770 Matt. xvi. 28.</note>
<note type="footnote">5771 Matt. xxviii. 20.</note>

so long as we were not yet held worthy to see “the kingdom of God come with power,” and
“the Son of man coming in His own glory and in His own kingdom.”</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">
<pb n="923"/>
<head>35. Scriptural References to Death.</head>
<p>But since here it is written in the three Evangelists, “They shall not taste of death,”5772
but in other writers different things are written concerning death, it may not be out of place
to bring forward and examine these passages along with the “taste.” In the Psalms, then, it
is said, “What man is he that shall live and not see death?”5773 And again, in another place,
“Let death come upon them and let them go down into Hades alive;”5774 but in one of the
prophets, “Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up;”5775 and in the Apocalypse,
“Death and Hades follow some.”5776 Now in these passages it appears to me that it is one
thing to taste of death, but another thing to see death, and another thing for it to come upon
some, and that a fourth thing, different from the aforesaid, is signified by the words, “Death
becoming mighty has swallowed them up,” and a fifth thing, different from these, by the
words, Death and Hades follow them.” And if you were to collect them, you would perhaps
find also other differences than those which we have mentioned, by a comparison of which
with one another and right investigation, you would find the things signified in each place.
But here I inquire whether it is a less evil to see death, but a greater evil than seeing to taste
of it, but still worse than this that death should follow any one, and not only follow him,
but also now come upon him and seize him whom it formerly followed; but to be swallowed
up seems to be more grievous than all the things spoken of. But giving heed to what is said,
and to the differences of sins committed, you will not I think, be slow to admit that things
of this kind were intended by the Spirit who caused these things to be written in the oracles
of God. But, if it be necessary to give an exposition clearer than what has been said of what
is signified by seeing the Son of man coming in His own kingdom, or in His own glory, and
what is signified by seeing the kingdom of God come with power, these things—whether
those that are made to shine in our hearts, or that are found by those who seek, or that enter
gradually into our thoughts,—let each one judge as he wills—we will set forth. He who beholds
and apprehends the excellency of the Word, as he breaks down and refutes all the
plausible forms of things which are truly lies but profess to be truths, sees the Son of man,
(according to the word of John, “the Word of God,”) coming in His own kingdom; but if
such an one were to behold the Word, not only breaking down plausible oppositions, but
also representing His own truths with perfect clearness, he would behold His glory in addition
to His kingdom. And such an one indeed would see in Him the kingdom of God come with
power; and he would see this, as one who is no longer now under the reign of “sin which

reigns in the mortal body of those who sin,”5777 but is ever under the orders of the king,
who is God of all, whose kingdom is indeed potentially “within us,”5778 but actually, and,
as Mark has called it, “with power,” and not at all in weakness within the perfect alone.
These things, then, Jesus promised to the disciples who were standing, prophesying not
about all of them, but about some.</p>

<head>36. Concerning the Transfiguration of the Saviour.</head>
<p>“Now after six days,” according to Matthew and Mark,5779 “He taketh with him Peter
and James and John his brother, and leads them up into a high mountain apart, and was
transfigured before them.” Now, also, let it be granted, before the exposition that occurs to
us in relation to these things, that this took place long ago, and according to the letter. But
it seems to me, that those who are led up by Jesus into the high mountain, and are deemed
worthy of beholding His transfiguration apart, are not without purpose led up six days after
the discourses previously spoken. For since in six days—the perfect number—the whole
world,—this perfect work of art,—was made, on this account I think that he who transcends
all the things of the world by beholding no longer the things which are seen, for they are
temporal, but already the things which not seen, and only the things which are not seen,
because that they are eternal, is represented in the words, “After six days Jesus took up with
Him” certain persons. If therefore any one of us wishes to be taken by Jesus, and led up by
Him into the high mountain, and be deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration apart,
let him pass beyond the six days, because he no longer beholds the things which are seen,
nor longer loves the world, nor the things in the world,5780 nor lusts after any worldly lust,
which is the lust of bodies, and of the riches of the body, and of the glory which is after the
flesh, and whatever things whose nature it is to distract and drag away the soul from the
things which are better and diviner, and bring it down and fix it fast to the deceit of this age,
in wealth and glory, and the rest of the lusts which are the foes of truth. For when he has
passed through the six days, as we have said, he will keep a new Sabbath, rejoicing in the
lofty mountain, because he sees Jesus transfigured before him; for the Word has different
forms, as He appears to each as is expedient for the beholder, and is manifested to no one
beyond the capacity of the beholder.</p>

<head>37. Force of the Words “Before Them.”</head>
<p>But you will ask if, when He was transfigured before those who were led up by Him into
the lofty mountain, He appeared to them in the form of God, in which He formerly was, so
that He had to those below the form of a servant, but to those who had followed Him after
the six days to the lofty mountain, He had not that form, but the form of God. But hear
these things, if you can, at the same time giving heed spiritually, that it is not said simply,
“He was transfigured,” but with a certain necessary addition, which Matthew and Mark
have recorded; for, according to both, “He was transfigured before them.”5781 And according
to this, indeed, you will say that it is possible for Jesus to be transfigured before some with
this transfiguration, but before others at the same time not to be transfigured. But if you
wish to see the transfiguration of Jesus before those who went up into the lofty mountain
apart long with Him, behold with me the Jesus in the Gospels, as more simply apprehended,
and as one might say, known “according to the flesh,” by those who do not go up, through
works and words which are uplifting, to the lofty mountain of wisdom, but known no longer
after the flesh, but known in His divinity by means of all the Gospels, and beholden in the
form of God according to their knowledge; for before them is Jesus transfigured, and not
to any one of those below. But when He is transfigured, His face also shines as the sun, that
He may be manifested to the children of light, who have put off the works of darkness, and
put on the armour of light,5782 and are no longer the children of darkness or night, but have
become the sons of day, and walk honestly as in the day;5783 and being manifested, He will
shine unto them not simply as the sun, but as demonstrated to be the sun of righteousness.</p>

<head>38. The Garments White as the Light.</head>
<p>And not only is He transfigured before such disciples, nor does He only add to the
transfiguration the shining of His face as the sun; but further also to those who were led up
by Him into the high mountain apart, His garments appear white as the light.5784 But the
garments of Jesus are the expressions and letters of the Gospels with which He invested
Himself. But I think that even the words in the Apostles which indicate the truths concerning
Him are garments of Jesus, which become white to those who go up into the high mountain
along with Jesus. But since there are differences also of things white, His garments become
white as the brightest and purest of all white things; and that is light. When therefore you
see any one not only with a thorough understanding of the theology concerning Jesus, but
also making clear every expression of the Gospels, do not hesitate to say that to Him the
garments of Jesus have become white as the light. But when the Son of God in His transfiguration
is so understood and beheld, that His face is a sun, and His garments white as the
light, straightway there will appear to him who beholds Jesus in such form Moses,—the
law—and Elijah,—in the way of synecdoche, not one prophet only, but all the prophets—holding
converse with Jesus; for such is the force of the words “talking with Him;”5785 but, according
to Luke, “Moses and Elijah appeared in glory,” down to the words, “in Jerusalem.”
5786 But if any one sees the glory of Moses, having understood the spiritual law as a
discourse in harmony with Jesus, and the wisdom in the prophets which is hidden in a
mystery,5787 he sees Moses and Elijah in glory when he sees them with Jesus.</p>

<head>39. Jesus Was Transfigured—“As He Was Praying.”</head>
<p>Then, since it will be necessary to expound the passage as given in Mark, “And as He
was praying He was transfigured before them,”5788 we must say that perhaps it is possible
especially to see the Word transfigured before us if we have done the things aforesaid, and
gone up into the mountain, and seen the absolute Word holding converse with the Father,
and praying to Him for such things as the true High-Priest might pray for to the only true
God. But in order that He may thus hold fellowship with God and pray to the Father, He
goes up into the mountain; and then, according to Mark, “His garments become white and
glistening as the light, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.”5789 And perhaps the fullers
upon the earth are the wise men of this world who are careful about the diction which they
consider to be bright and pure, so that even their base thoughts and false dogmas seem to
be beautified by their fulling, so to speak; but He who shows His own garments glistering
to those who have ascended and brighter than their fulling can make them, is the Word,
who exhibits in the expressions of the Scriptures which are despised by many the glistering
of the thoughts, when the raiment of Jesus, according to Luke, becomes white and
dazzling.5790</p>

<head>40. Discussion of the Saying of Peter.</head>
<p>But let us next see what was the thought of Peter when he answered and said to Jesus,
“Lord, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles,”5791 etc. And on this account
these words call for very special examination, because Mark, in his own person, has added,
“For he wist not what to answer,”5792 but Luke, “not knowing,” he says, “what he spake.”5793
You will consider, therefore, if he spake these things as in a trance, being filled with the
spirit which moved him to say these things, which could not be a Holy Spirit; for John taught
in the Gospel that, before the resurrection of the Saviour, no one had the Holy Spirit, saying,
“For the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.”5794 But if the Spirit was
not yet, and he, not knowing what he said, spoke under the influence of some spirit, the
spirit which caused these things to be said was some one of the spirits which had not yet
been triumphed over in the cross, nor made a show of along with them, about whom it is
written, “Having put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show
of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross.”5795 But this spirit was perhaps that
which is called a stumbling-block by Jesus, and which is spoken of as Satan in the passage,
“Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a stumbling-block unto me.”5796 But I know well that
such things will offend many who meet with them, because they think that it is opposed to
sound reason that he should be spoken ill of who a little before had been pronounced blessed
by Jesus, on the ground that the Father in heaven had revealed to him the things concerning
the Saviour, to-wit, that He was verily Jesus, and the Christ, and the Son of the living God.
But let such an one attend more exactly to the statements about Peter and the rest of the
Apostles, how even they made requests as if they were yet alien from Him who was to redeem
them from the enemy and purchase them with His own precious blood; or let them also,
who will have it that even before the passion of Jesus the Apostles were perfect, tell us whence
it came about that “Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep.”5797 But to
anticipate something else of what follows and apply it to the subject in hand, I would raise
in turn these questions,—whether it is possible for any one to find occasion of stumbling
in Jesus apart from the working of the devil who caused him to stumble; and whether it is
possible for any one to deny Jesus, and that in presence of a little maid and a doorkeeper
and men most worthless, unless a spirit had been with him in his denial hostile to the Spirit

which is given and the wisdom, (which is given) to those who are assisted by God to make
confession, according to a certain desert of theirs. But he who has learned to refer the roots
of sin to the father of sin, the devil, will not say that apart from him either the Apostles were
caused to stumble, or that Peter denied Christ thrice before that well-known cock-crowing.
But if this be so, consider whether perhaps with a view to make Jesus stumble, so far as was
in his power, and to turn Him aside from the dispensation whose characteristic was suffering
that brought salvation to men, which He undertook with great willingness, seeking to effect
these things which seemed to contribute to this end, he himself also here wishes as it were,
by deceit, to draw away Jesus, as if calling upon Him no longer to condescend to men, and
come to them, and undergo death for them, but to abide on the high mountain with Moses
and Elijah. But he promised also to build three tabernacles, one apart for Jesus, and one for
Moses, and one for Elijah, as if one tabernacle would not have sufficed for the three, if it
had been necessary for them to be in tabernacles and in the high mountain. And perhaps
also in this he acted with evil intent, when he incited him “who did not know what he said,”
not desiring that Jesus and Moses and Elijah should be together, but desiring to separate
them from one another, under pretext of the three tabernacles.” And likewise it was a lie,
“It is good for us to be here;”5798 for if it had been a good thing they would also have re
mained there. But if it were a lie, you will seek to know who caused the lie to be spoken;
and especially since according to John, “When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own; for
he is a liar and the father thereof;”5799 and as there is no truth apart from the working of
Him who says, “I am the Truth,”5800 so there is no lie apart from him who is the enemy of
truth. These contrary qualities, accordingly, were still in Peter truth and falsehood; and
from truth he said, “Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God,”5801 but from falsehood
he said, “May God be propitious to Thee, Lord, this shall not be unto Thee,”5802 and also,
“It is good for us to be here.”5803 But if any one will not admit that Peter spoke these things
from any evil inspiration, but that his words were of his own mere choice, and it is demanded
of him how he will interpret, “not knowing what he said,” and,5804 “for he did not know
what to answer,”5805 he will say, that in the former case Peter held it to be a shameful thing
and unworthy of Jesus to admit that the Son of the living God, the Christ, whom already

the Father had revealed to him, should be killed; and in the present case that, as having seen
the two forms of Jesus and the one at the transfiguration which was much more excellent,
being well pleased with that, he said that it was good to make their sojourning in that
mountain, in order that he himself and those with him might rejoice as they beheld the
transfiguration of Jesus and His face shining as the sun, and His garments white as the light,
and, in addition to these things, might always behold in glory those whom they had once
seen in glory, Moses and Elijah; and that they might rejoice at the things which they might
hear, as they talked and held intercourse with each other, Moses and Elijah with Jesus, and
Jesus with them.</p>

<head>41. Figurative Interpretation of the Same.</head>
<p>But since we have not yet spent our energy in interpreting the things in the place figuratively,
but have said these things by way of searching into the mere letter, let us in conformity
with these things, consider whether the aforesaid Peter and the sons of thunder who were
taken up into the mountain of the dogmas of the truth, and who saw the transfiguration of
Jesus and of Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory with Him, might wish to make tabernacles
in themselves for the Word of God who was going to dwell in them, and for His law
which had been beholden in glory, and for the prophecy which spake of the decease of Jesus,
which He was about to accomplish;5806 and Peter, as one loving the contemplative life, and
having preferred that which was delightsome in it to the life among the crowd with its turmoil,
said, with the design of benefiting those who desired it, “It is good for us to be here.”5807
But since “love seeketh not its own,”5808 Jesus did not do that which Peter thought good;
wherefore He descended from the mountain to those who were not able to ascend to it and
behold His transfiguration, that they might behold Him in such form as they were able to
see Him. It is, therefore, the part of a righteous man who possesses “the love which seeketh
not its own”5809 to be free from all, but to bring himself under bondage to all those below
that He might gain the more of them.5810 But some one, with reference to what we have
alleged about the trance and the working of an evil spirit in Peter, concerning the words,
“not knowing what he said,”5811 not accepting that interpretation of ours, may say that there
were certain mentioned by Paul “desiring to be teachers of the law,”5812 who do not know
about what they speak, but who, though they do not clearly expound the nature of what is
said, nor understand their meaning, make confident affirmations of things which they do
not know. Of such a nature was the affection of Peter also, for not apprehending what was
good with reference to the dispensation of Jesus and of those who appeared in the mountain,—
Moses and Elijah,—he says, “It is good for us to be here,” etc., “not knowing what he
said,” “for he wist not what to say,” for if “a wise man will understand the things from his
own mouth, and carries prudence in his lips,”5813 he who is not so does not understand the
things from his own mouth, nor comprehend the nature of the things spoken by him.</p>

<head>42. The Meaning of the “Bright Cloud.”</head>
<p>Next to these come the words, “While He was yet speaking, behold, also, a bright cloud
overshadowed them,”5814 etc. Now, I think that God, wishing to dissuade Peter from making
three tabernacles, under which so far as it depended on his choice he was going to dwell,
shows a tabernacle better, so to speak, and much more excellent, the cloud. For since it is
the function of a tabernacle to overshadow him who is in it, and to shelter him, and the
bright cloud overshadowed them, God made, as it were, a diviner tabernacle, inasmuch as
it was bright, that it might be to them a pattern of the resurrection to come; for a bright
cloud overshadows the just, who are at once protected and illuminated and shone upon by
it. But what might the bright cloud, which overshadows the just, be? Is it, perhaps, the
fatherly power, from which comes the voice of the Father bearing testimony to the Son as
beloved and well-pleasing, and exhorting those who were under its shadow to hear Him
and no other one? But as He speaks of old, so also always does He speak through what He
wills. And perhaps, too, the Holy Spirit is the bright cloud which overshadows the just, and
prophesies of the things of God, who works in it, and says, “This is My beloved Son in whom
I am well-pleased;” but I would venture also to say that our Saviour is a bright cloud. When,
therefore, Peter said, “Let us make here three tabernacles,”5815…one from the Father Himself,
and from the Son, and one from the Holy Spirit. For a bright cloud of the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit overshadows the genuine disciples of Jesus; or a cloud overshadows the Gospel
and the law and the prophets, which is bright to him who is able to see the light of it in the
Gospel, and the law, and the prophets. But perhaps the voice from the cloud says to Moses
and Elijah, “This is My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased, hear Him,” as they were
desirous to see the Son of man, and to hear Him, and to behold Him as He was in glory.
And perhaps it teaches the disciples that He who was, in a literal sense, the Son of God, and
His beloved in whom He was well-pleased, whom it behoved them especially to hear, was
He who was then beheld, and transfigured, and whose face shone as the sun, and who was
clothed with garments white as the light.</p>

<head>43. Relation of Moses and Elijah to Jesus. The Injunction of Silence.</head>
<p>But after these things it is written that, when they heard the voice from the cloud bearing
testimony to the Son, the three Apostles, not being able to bear the glory of the voice and
power resting upon it, “fell on their face,”5816 and besought God; for they were sore afraid
at the supernatural sight, and the things which were spoken from the sight. But consider if
you can also say this with reference to the details in the passage, that the disciples, having
understood that the Son of God had been holding conference with Moses, and that it was
He who said, “A man shall not see My face and live,”5817 and taking further the testimony
of God about Him, as not being able to endure the radiance of the Word, humbled themselves
under the mighty hand of God;5818 but, after the touch of the Word, lifting up their eyes
they saw Jesus only and no other.5819 Moses, the law, and Elijah, the prophet, became one
only with the Gospel of Jesus; and not, as they were formerly three, did they so abide, but
the three became one. But consider these things with me in relation to mystical matters;
for in regard to the bare meaning of the letter, Moses and Elijah, having appeared in glory
and talked with Jesus, went away to the place from which they had come, perhaps to communicate
the words which Jesus spake with them, to those who were to be benefited by
Him, almost immediately, namely, at the time of the passion, when many bodies of the
saints that had fallen asleep, their tombs being opened, were to go to the city which is truly
holy—not the Jerusalem which Jesus wept over—and there appear unto many.5820 But after
the dispensation in the mountain, when the disciples were coming down from the mountain
in order that, when they had come to the multitude, they might serve the Son of God concerning
the salvation of the people, Jesus commanded the disciples saying, “Tell the vision
to no man until the Son of man rise from the dead.”5821 But that saying, “Tell the vision to
no man,” is like that which was investigated in the passage above, when “He enjoined the
disciples to tell no man that He was the Christ.”5822 Wherefore the things that were said
at that passage may be useful to us also for the passage before us; since Jesus wishes also, in
accordance with these, that the things of His glory should not be spoken of, before His glory
after the passion; for those who heard, and in particular the multitudes, would have been
injured when they saw Him crucified, who had been so glorified. Wherefore since His being
glorified in the resurrection was akin to His transfiguration, and to the vision of His face as

<head>1. Relation of the Baptist to Elijah. The Theory of Transmigration Considered.</head>
<p>“The disciples asked Him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first
come?”5823 The disciples indeed who went up with Jesus remembered the traditions of the
scribes concerning Elijah, that before the advent of Christ, Elijah would come and prepare
for Him the souls of those who were going to receive Him. But the vision in the mountain,
at which Elijah appeared, did not seem to be in harmony with the things which were said,
since to them it seemed that Elijah had not come before Jesus but after Him; wherefore,
they say these things, thinking that the scribes lied. But to this the Saviour answers, not
setting aside the traditions concerning Elijah, but saying that there was another advent of
Elijah before that of Christ of which the scribes were ignorant; and, in regard to this, being
ignorant of him, they “had done unto him whatsoever they listed,”5824 as if they had been
accomplices in his having been cast into prison by Herod and slain by him; then He says
that according as they had done towards Elijah so would He suffer at their hands.5825 And
these things indeed as about Elijah the disciples asked and the Saviour answered, but when
they heard they understood that the words, “Elijah has already come,” and that following
which was spoken by the Saviour, had reference to John the Baptist.5826 And let these things
be said by way of illustration of the passage before us. But now according to our ability let
us make investigation also into the things that are stored up in it. In this place it does not
appear to me that by Elijah the soul is spoken of, lest I should fall into the dogma of transmigration,
which is foreign to the church of God, and not handed down by the Apostles,
nor anywhere set forth in the Scriptures; for it is also in opposition to the saying that “things
seen are temporal,”5827 and that “this age shall have a consummation,” and also to the fulfilment
of the saying, “Heaven and earth shall pass away,”5828 and “the fashion of this world
passeth away,”5829 and “the heavens shall perish,”5830 and what follows. For if, by hypothesis,
in the constitution of things which has existed from the beginning unto the end of the world,
the same soul can be twice in the body, for what cause should it be in it? For if because of
sin it should be twice in the body, why should it not be thrice, and repeatedly in it, since

<pb n="938"/>
punishments, in respect of this life, and of the sins committed in it, shall be rendered to it
only by the method of transmigration? But if this be granted as a consequence, perhaps
there will never be a time when a soul shall not undergo transmigration: for always because
of its former sins will it dwell in the body; and so there will be no place for the corruption
of the world, at which “the heaven and the earth shall pass away.”5831 And if it be granted,
on this hypothesis, that one who is absolutely sinless shall not come into the body by birth,
after what length of time do you suppose that a soul shall be found absolutely pure and
needing no transmigration? But nevertheless, also, if any one soul is always thus being removed
from the definite number of souls and returns no longer to the body, sometime after
infinite ages, as it were, birth shall cease; the world being reduced to some one or two or a
few more, after the perfecting of whom the world shall perish, the supply of souls coming
into the body having failed. But this is not agreeable to the Scripture; for it knows of a
multitude of sinners at the time of the destruction of the world. This is manifest from
consideration of the saying, “How-beit when the Son of man cometh shall He find faith on
the earth?”5832 So we find it thus said in Matthew, “As were the days of Noah so shall also
be the coming of the Son of man; for as they were in the days of the flood,” etc.5833 But to
those who are then in existence there shall be the exaction of a penalty for their sins, but
not by way of transmigration; for, if they are caught while still sinning, either they will be
punished after this by a different form of punishment,—and according to this either there
will be two general forms of punishment, the one by way of transmigration, and the other
outside of a body of this kind, and let them declare the causes and differences of these,—or
they will not be punished, as if those who were left at the consummation of things had
forthwith cast away their sins; or, which is better, there is one form of punishment for those
who have sinned in the body, namely, that they should suffer, outside of it, that is, outside
the constitution of this life, what is according to the desert of their sins. But to one who has
insight into the nature of things it is clear that each of these things is fitted to overturn the
doctrine of transmigration. But if, of necessity, the Greeks who introduce the doctrine of
transmigration, laying down things in harmony with it, do not acknowledge that the world
is coming to corruption, it is fitting that when they have looked the Scriptures straight in
the face which plainly declare that the world will perish, they should either disbelieve them,
or invent a series of arguments in regard to the interpretation of the things concerning the
consummation; which even if they wish they will not be able to do. And this besides we will
say to those who may have had the hardihood to aver that the world will not perish, that, if
the world does not perish but is to exist for infinite periods of time, there will be no God

knowing all things before they come into being. But if, perhaps, He knows in part, either
He will know each thing before it comes into being, or certain things, and after these again
other things; for things infinite in nature cannot possibly be grasped by that knowledge
whose nature it is to limit things known. From this it follows that there cannot be prophecies
about all things whatsoever, since all things are infinite.</p>

<head>2. “The Spirit and Power of Elijah”—Not the Soul—Were in the Baptist.</head>
<p>I have thought it necessary to dwell some time on the examination of the doctrine of
transmigration, because of the suspicion of some who suppose that the soul under consideration
was the same in Elijah and in John, being called in the former case Elijah, and in the
second case John; and that, not apart from God, had he been called John, as is plain from
the saying of the angel who appeared to Zacharias, “Fear not, Zacharias, for thy supplication
is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John;”5834
and from the fact that Zacharias regained his speech after he had written in the tablet, that
he who had been born should be called John.5835 But if it were the soul of Elijah, then, when
he was begotten a second time, he should have been called Elijah; or for the change of name
some reason should have been assigned, as in the case of Abram and Abraham, Sarah and
Sarrah, Jacob and Israel, Simon and Peter. And yet not even thus would their argument in
the case be tenable; for, in the case of the aforesaid, the changes of name took place in one
and the same life. But some one might ask, if the soul of Elijah was not first in the Tishbite
and secondly in John, what might that be in both which the Saviour called Elijah? And I
say that Gabriel in his words to Zacharias suggested what the substance was in Elijah and
John that was the same; for he says, “Many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
their God; and he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah.”5836 For, observe,
he did not say in the “soul” of Elijah, in which case the doctrine of transmigration might
have some ground, but “in the spirit and power of Elijah.” For the Scripture well knows the
distinction between spirit and soul, as, “May God sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit
and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ;”5837 and the passage, “Bless the Lord, ye spirits and souls of the righteous”5838 as it
stands in the book of Daniel, according to the Septuagint, represents the difference between
spirit and soul. Elijah, therefore, was not called John because of the soul, but because of the
spirit and the power, which in no way conflicts with the teaching of the church, though they
were formerly in Elijah, and afterwards in John; and “the spirits of the prophets are subject
to the prophets,”5839 but the souls of the prophets are not subject to the prophets, and “the
spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha.”5840 But we ought to inquire whether the spirit of Elijah is
the same as the spirit of God in Elijah, or whether they are different from each other, and

<pb n="941"/>
whether the spirit of Elijah which was in him was something supernatural, different from
the spirit of each man which is in him; for the Apostle clearly indicates that the Spirit of
God, though it be in us, is different from the spirit of each man which is in Him, when he
says somewhere, “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children
of God;”5841 and elsewhere, “No one of men knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of
the man which is in him; even so the things of God none knoweth save the Spirit of God.”5842
But do not marvel in regard to what is said about Elijah, if, just as something strange
happened to him different from all the saints who are recorded, in respect of his having
been caught up by a whirlwind into heaven,5843 so his spirit had something of choice excellence,
so that not only did it rest on Elisha, but also descended along with John at his birth;
and that John, separately, “was filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother’s womb,”
and separately, “came before Christ in the spirit and power of Elijah.”5844 For it is possible
for several spirits not only worse, but also better, to be in the same man. David accordingly
asks to be established by a free spirit,5845 and that a right spirit be renewed in his inward
parts.5846 But if, in order that the Saviour may impart to us of “the spirit of wisdom and
understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and reverence,”5847
he was filled also with the spirit of the fear of the Lord; it is possible also that these several
good spirits may be conceived as being in the same person. And this also we have brought
forward, because of John having come before Christ “in the spirit and power of Elijah,”5848
in order that the saying, “Elijah has already come,”5849 may be referred to the spirit of Elijah
that was in John; as also the three disciples who had gone up with Him understood that He
spake to them about John the Baptist.5850 Upon Elisha, then, only the spirit of Elijah rested,
but John came before,5851 not only in the spirit, but also in the power of Elijah. Wherefore,
also, Elisha could not have been called Elijah, but John was Elijah himself. But if it be necessary
to adduce the Scripture from which the scribes said that Elijah must first come, listen
to Malachi who says, “And behold I will send to you Elijah the Tishbite,” etc., down to the

words, “Lest I come and smite the earth utterly.”5852 And it seems to be indicated by these
words, that Elijah was to prepare for the glorious coming of Christ by certain holy words
and dispositions in their souls, those who had been made fittest for this, which those upon
earth could not have endured, because of the excellency of the glory, unless they had been
prepared before hand by Elijah. And likewise, by Elijah, in this place, I do not understand
the soul of that prophet but his spirit and his power; for these it is by which all things shall
be restored,5853 so that when they have been restored, and, as a result of that restoration,
become capable of receiving the glory of Christ, the Son of God who shall appear in glory
may sojourn with them. But if also Elijah be in some sort a word inferior to “the Word who
was in the beginning with God, God the Word,”5854 this word also might come as a preparatory
discipline to the people prepared by it, that they might be trained for the reception of
the perfect Word. But some one may raise the question whether the spirit and power of
Elijah, suffered what was suffered in John, according to the words, “They did in him whatsoever
they listed.”5855 And to this it will be said on the one hand, in simpler fashion that
there is nothing strange in the thought, that the things which assist do, because of love,
suffer along with those that are assisted; and Jesus indeed says. “Because of the weak I was
weak, and I hungered because of the hungry, and I thirsted because of the thirsty,”5856 and,
on the other hand, in a deeper sense that the words are not, “But they did unto him whatsoever
they listed in him,” for the things which suffered leaned upon the spirit and the power
of Elijah, the soul of John being in no wise Elijah; and probably also the body (leaned upon
them). For in one fashion is the soul in the body, and the spirit, and the power; and in another
fashion is the body of the righteous man in these better parts, as leaning upon them,
and clinging to them; but “they who are in the flesh cannot please God; but ye are not in
the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwell in you;”5857 for the soul of the sinner is
in the flesh, but of the righteous man in spirit. And likewise, further, this might be inquired
into, to whom refer the words, “But they did in him whatsoever they listed.”5858 Was it to
the scribes in regard to whom the disciples inquired and said, “Why then do the scribes say
that Elijah must first come?”5859 But it is not at all evident that John suffered anything at
the hands of the scribes, except, indeed, that they did not believe him; or, as we said also

before, that they were accomplices in the wrongs which Herod dared to inflict on him. But
another might say that the words, “But they did in him whatsoever they listed,” refer not to
the scribes but to Herodias and her daughter, and Herod, who did in him whatsoever they
listed. And that which follows, “So shall the Son of man suffer from them,”5860 might be
referred to the scribes, if the former were referred to them; but, if the former refers to Herod
and Herodias and her daughter, the second passage will also refer to them;5861 for Herod

<head>3. Concerning the Epileptic.</head>
<p>“And when they were come to the multitude, there came to Him a man kneeling to Him
and saying, Lord, have mercy upon my son.”5862 Those who are suffering, or the kinsfolk
of the sufferers, are along with the multitudes; wherefore, when He has dispensed the things
that were beyond the multitudes, He descends to them, so that those, who were not able to
ascend because of the sicknesses that repressed their soul, might be benefited when the
Word descended to them from the loftier regions. But we ought to make inquiry, in respect
of what diseases the sufferers believe and pray for their own healing, and in respect of what
diseases others do this for them, as, for example, the centurion for his servant, and the nobleman
for his son, and the ruler of the synagogue for a daughter, and the Canaanitish woman
for her female child who was vexed with a demon, and now the man who kneels to Him on
behalf of his epileptic son. And along with these you will investigate when the Saviour heals
of Himself and unasked by any one, as for example, the paralytic; for these cures, when
compared with one another for this very purpose, and examined together, will exhibit to
him who is able to hear “the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery,”5863 many dogmas concerning
the different diseases of souls, as well as the method of their healing.</p>

<head>4. Spiritual Epileptics.</head>
<p>But since our present object is not to make inquiry about every case, but about the
passage before us, let us, adopting a figurative interpretation, consider who we may say the
lunatic was, and who was his father who prayed for him, and what is meant by the sufferer
falling not constantly but oft-times, sometimes into the fire, and sometimes into the water,
and what is meant by the fact that he could not be healed by the disciples but by Jesus
Himself. For if every sickness and every infirmity, which our Saviour then healed among
the people, refers to different disorders in souls, it is also in accordance with reason that by
the paralytics are symbolised the palsied in soul, who keep it lying paralysed in the body;
but by those who are blind are symbolised those who are blind in respect of things seen by
the soul alone, and these are really blind; and by the deaf are symbolised those who are deaf
in regard to the reception of the word of salvation. On the same principle it will be necessary
that the matters regarding the epileptic should be investigated. Now this affection attacks
the sufferers at considerable intervals, during which he who suffers from it seems in no way
to differ from the man in good health, at the season when the epilepsy is not working on
him. Similar disorders you may find in certain souls, which are often supposed to be healthy
in point of temperance and the other virtues; then, sometimes, as if they were seized with
a kind of epilepsy arising from their passions, they fall down from the position in which
they seemed to stand, and are drawn away by the deceit of this world and other lusts. Perhaps,
therefore, you would not err if you said, that such persons, so to speak, are epileptic spiritually,
having been cast down by “the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places,”5864
and are often ill, at the time when the passions attack their soul; at one time falling into the
fire of burnings, when, according to what is said in Hosea, they become adulterers, like a
pan heated for the cooking from the burning flame;5865 and, at another time, into the water,
when the king of all the dragons in the waters casts them down from the sphere where they
appeared to breath freely, so that they come into the depths of the waves of the sea of human
life. This interpretation of ours in regard to the lunatic will be supported by him who says
in the Book of Wisdom with reference to the even temperament of the just man, “The discourse
of a pious man is always wisdom,” but, in regard to what we have said, “The fool
changes as the moon.”5866 And sometimes even in the case of such you may see impulses
which might carry away in praise of them those who do not attend to their want of ballast,
so that they would say that it was as full moon in their case, or almost full moon. And you

might see again the light that seemed to be in them diminishing ,—as it was not the light of
day but the light of night,—fading to so great an extent, that the light which appeared to be
seen in them no longer existed. But whether or not those who first gave their names to
things, on account of this gave the name of lunacy to the disease epilepsy, you will judge for
yourself.</p>

<head>5. The Deaf and Dumb Spirit.</head>
<p>Now the father of the epileptic—perhaps the angel to whom he had been allotted, if we
are to say that every human soul is put in subjection to some angel—prays the Physician of
souls for his son that He may heal him who could not be healed from his disorder by the
inferior word which was in the disciples. But the dumb and deaf spirit, who was cast out
by the Word, must be figuratively understood as the irrational impulses, even towards that
which seems to be good, so that, what things any man once did by irrational impulse which
seemed to onlookers to be good, he may do no longer irrationally but according to the
reason of the teaching of Jesus. Under the inspiration of this Paul also said, “If I have all
faith so as to remove mountains;”5867 for he, who has all faith, which is as a grain of mustard
seed,5868 removes not one mountain only, but also several analogous to it; for although faith
is despised by men and appears to be something very little and contemptible; yet when it
meets with good ground, that is the soul, which is able fittingly to receive such seed, it becomes
a great tree, so that no one of those things which have no wings, but the birds of
heaven which are winged spiritually, are able to lodge in the branches of faith so great.5869</p>

<head>6. Influence of the Moon and Stars on Men.</head>
<p>Let us now, then, give heed to the very letter of the passage, and first let us inquire, how
he who has been cast into darkness and repressed by an impure and deaf and dumb spirit
is said to be a “lunatic,” and for what reason the expression to be a “lunatic” derives its name
from the great light in heaven which is next to the sun, which God appointed “to rule over
the night.”5870 Let physicians then, discuss the physiology of the matter, inasmuch as they
think that there is no impure spirit in the case, but a bodily disorder, and inquiring into the
nature of things let them say, that the moist humours which are in the head are moved by
a certain sympathy which they have with the light of the moon, which has a moist nature;
but as for us, who also believe the Gospel that this sickness is viewed as having been effected
by an impure dumb and deaf spirit in those who suffer from it, and who see that those, who
are accustomed like the magicians of the Egyptians to promise a cure in regard to such,
seem sometimes to be successful in their case, we will say that, perhaps, with the view of
slandering the creation of God, in order that “unrighteousness may be spoken loftily, and
that they may set their mouth against the heaven,”5871 this impure spirit watches certain
configurations of the moon, and so makes it appear from observation of men suffering at
such and such a phase of the moon, that the cause of so great an evil is not the dumb and
deaf demon, but the great light in heaven which was appointed “to rule by night,” and which
has no power to originate such a disorder among men. But they all “speak unrighteousness
loftily,” as many as say, that the cause of all the disorders which exist on the earth, whether
of such generally or of each in detail, arises from the disposition of the stars; and such have
truly “set their mouth against the heaven,” when they say that some of the stars have a
malevolent, and others a benevolent influence; since no star was formed by the God of the
universe to work evil, according to Jeremiah as it is written in the Lamentations, “Out of
the mouth of the Lord shall come things noble and that which is good.”5872 And it is
probable that as this impure spirit, producing what is called lunacy, observes the phases of
the moon, that it may work on him who for certain causes has been committed to it, and
who has not made himself worthy of the guardianship of angels, so also there are other
spirits and demons who work at certain phases of the rest of the stars; so that not the moon
only, but the rest of the stars also may be calumniated by those “who speak unrighteousness
loftily.” It is worth while, then, to listen to the casters of nativities, who refer the origin of
every form of madness and every demoniacal possession to the phases of the moon. That
those, then, who suffer from what is called lunacy sometimes fall into the water is evident,
and that they also fall into the fire, less frequently indeed, yet it does happen; and it is evident

<note type="footnote">5872 Lam. iii. 38. Origen reads τὰ καλὰ instead of τὰ κακὰ.</note>

<pb n="949"/>
that this disorder is very difficult to cure, so that those who have the power to cure demoniacs
sometimes fail in respect of this, and sometimes with fastings and supplications and more
toils, succeed. But you will inquire whether there are such disorders in spirits as well as in
men; so that some of them speak, but some of them are speechless, and some of them hear,
but some are deaf; for as in them will be found the cause of their being impure, so also, because
of their freedom of will, are they condemned to be speechless and deaf; for some men
will suffer such condemnation if the prayer of the prophet, as spoken by the Holy Spirit,
shall be given heed to, in which it is said of certain sinners, “Let the lying lips be put to silence.”
5873 And so, perhaps, those who make a bad use of their hearing, and admit the
hearing of vanities, will be rendered deaf by Him who said, “Who hath made the stone-deaf
and the deaf,”5874 so that they may no longer lend an ear to vain things.</p>

<head>7. The Power of Faith.</head>
<p>But when the Saviour said, “O faithfulness and perverse generation,”5875 He signifies
that wickedness, which is contrary to nature, stealthily enters in from perversity, and makes
us perverted. But of the whole race of men on earth, I think, being oppressed by reason of
their wickedness and His tarrying with them, the Saviour said, “How long shall I be with
you?” We have already, then, spoken in part of the words, “If ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain,”5876 etc.; but nevertheless also we shall speak
in this place the things that appear to us fitted to increase perspicuity. The mountains here
spoken of, in my opinion, are the hostile powers that have their being in a flood of great
wickedness, such as are settled down, so to speak, in some souls of men. Whenever, then,
any one has all faith so that he no longer disbelieves in any things which are contained in
the Holy Scriptures, and has faith such as was that of Abraham, who believed in God to such
a degree that his faith was counted for righteousness. he has all faith as a grain of mustard
seed; then will such an one say to this mountain—I mean, the dumb and deaf spirit in him
who is called lunatic,—“Remove hence,” clearly, from the man who is suffering, perhaps to
the abyss, and it shall remove. And the Apostle, taking, I think. his starting-point from this
place, says with apostolical authority, “If I have all faith so as to remove mountains,”5877
for not one mountain merely, but also several analogous to it, he removes who has all faith
which is as a grain of mustard-seed; and nothing shall be impossible to him who has so great
faith.5878 But let us also attend to this, “This kind goeth not out save by prayer and fasting,”
5879 in order that if at any time it is necessary that we should be engaged in the healing
of one suffering from such a disorder, we may not adjure, nor put questions, nor speak to
the impure spirit as if it heard, but devoting ourselves to prayer and fasting, may be successful
as we pray for the sufferer, and by our own fasting may thrust out the unclean spirit from
him.</p>

<head>8. Jesus’ Prediction of His “Delivery” Into the Hands of Men.</head>
<p>“And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered
into the hands of men.”5880 And these things will appear to be of the same effect as those,
“that Jesus began to show unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer
many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes.”5881 But it is not so; for it is not the
same thing “to show unto the disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many
things of the elders and chief priests and scribes,” and, after suffering, “be killed,” and, after
being killed, “be raised up on the third day,” as that which was said to them, when they were
in Galilee,—which we did not learn before,—that the Son of man “would be delivered up;”
for the being delivered up was not mentioned above, but now also it is said that “He is to
be delivered up into the hands of men.”5882 As for these matters let us inquire by what
person or persons He will be delivered up into the hands of men; for there we are taught of
whom He will suffer, and in what place He will suffer; but here, in addition, we learn that
while His suffering many things takes place at the hands of the aforesaid, they are not the
prime causes of His suffering many things, but the one or ones who delivered Him up into
the hands of men. For some one will say that the Apostle, interpreting this, says with reference
to God, “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all;”5883 but the
Son also gave Himself to death for us, so that He was delivered up, not only by the Father
but also by Himself. But another will say not merely that, but also collecting the passages
together, will say that the Son is first delivered up by God,—then about to be tempted, then
to be in conflict, then to suffer for men, or even for the whole world that He might take
away its sin,5884—to the prince of this age, and to the rest of its princes, and then by them
delivered into the hands of men who would slay Him. The case of Job will be taken as an
illustration. “Lo, all that is his I give into thy hands, but do not touch him;”5885 thereafter,
he was, as it were, delivered up by the devil to his princes, namely, to those who took prisoners
of war, to the horsemen, to the fire that came down from heaven, to the great wind
that came from the desert and broke up his house.5886 But you will consider if, as he delivered
up the property of Job to those who took them captive, and to the horsemen, so also he delivered
them up to a certain power, subordinate to “the prince of the power of the air, of the

spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience,”5887 in order that the fire which descended
thence on the sheep of Job might seem to fall from heaven, to the man who announced
to Job that “fire fell from heaven, and burned up his sheep, and consumed the shepherds
likewise.”5888 And in the same way you will inquire whether also the sudden mighty wind,
that came down from the desert and assailed the four corners of the dwelling, was one of
those which are under the devils to whom the devil delivered up the banquet of the sons
and daughters of Job, that the house might fall on the children of the just man, and they
might die. Let it be granted, then, that, as in the case of Job, the Father first delivered up
the Son to the opposing powers, and that then they delivered Him up into the hands of men,
among which men Judas also was, into whom after the sop5889 Satan entered, who delivered
Him up in a more authoritative manner than Judas. But take care lest on comparing together
the delivering up of the Son by the Father to the opposing powers, with the delivering up
of the Saviour by them into the hands of men, you should think that what is called the delivering
up is the same in the case of both. For understand that the Father in His love of men
delivered Him up for us all; but the opposing powers, when they delivered up the Saviour
into the hands of men, did not intend to deliver Him up for the salvation of some, but, as
far as in them lay, since none of them knew “the wisdom of God which was hidden in a
mystery,”5890 they gave Him up to be put to death, that His enemy death might receive Him
under its subjection, like those who die in Adam;5891 and also the men who slew Him did
so, as they were moulded after the will of those who wished indeed that Jesus should become
subject to death. I have deemed it necessary also to examine into these things, because that
when Jesus was delivered up into the hands of men, He was not delivered up by men into
the hands of men, but by powers to whom the Father delivered up His Son for us all, and
in the very act of His being delivered up, and coming under the power of those to whom
He was delivered up, destroying him that has the power of death; for “through death He
brought to nought him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil, and delivered all them
who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.”5892</p>

<head>9. Satan and the “Delivery” Of Jesus.</head>
<p>Now we must think that the devil has the power of death,—not of that which is common
and indifferent, in accordance with which those who are compacted of soul and body die,
when their soul is separated from the body,—but of that death which is contrary to and the
enemy of Him who said, “I am the Life,”5893 in accordance with which “the soul that sinneth,
it shall die.”5894 But that it was not God who gave Him up into the hands of men, the Saviour
manifestly declares when He says, “If My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants
fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews.”5895 For, when He was delivered up to the
Jews, He was delivered into the hands of men, not by His own servants, but by the prince
of this age who says, concerning the powers which are in the sphere of the invisible, the
kingdoms which are set up against men, “All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall
down and worship Me.”5896 Wherefore also we should think that in regard to them it was
said, “The kings of the earth stood side by side, and the rulers were gathered together against
the Lord and against His Christ.”5897 And those kings, indeed, and those rulers stood side
by side and were gathered against the Lord and against His Christ; but we, because we have
been benefited by His being delivered by them into the hands of men and slain, say, “Let us
break their bonds asunder and cast away their yoke from us.”5898 For, when we become
conformed to the death of Christ, we are no longer under the bonds of the kings of the earth,
as we have said, nor under the yoke of the princes of this age, who were gathered together
against the Lord. And, on this account, “the Father spared not His own Son, but delivered
Him up for us all,”5899 that those, who took Him and delivered Him up into the hands of
men, might be laughed at by Him who dwells in the heavens, and might be derided by the
Lord, inasmuch as, contrary to their expectation, it was to the destruction of their own
kingdom and power, that they received from the Father the Son, who was raised on the third
day, by having abolished His enemy death, and made us conformed, not only to the image
of His death but also of His resurrection; through whom we walk in newness of life,5900 no
longer sitting “in the region and shadow of death,”5901 through the light of God which has

not attending to the fact that He would rise on the third day, as He needed no longer time

<head>10. Concerning Those Who Demanded the Half-Shekel.</head>
<p>“And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to
Peter.”5904 There are certain kings of the earth, and the sons of these do not pay toll or
tribute; and there are others, different from their sons, who are strangers to the kings of the
earth, from whom the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute. And among the kings of the
earth, their sons are free as among fathers; but those who are strangers to them, while they
are free in relation to things beyond the earth, are as slaves in respect of those who lord it
over them and keep them in bondage; as the Egyptians lorded it over the children of Israel,
and greatly afflicted their life and violently held them in bondage.5905 It was for the sake
of those who were in a bondage, corresponding to the bondage of the Hebrews, that the Son
of God took upon Him only the form of a slave,5906 doing no work that was foul or servile.
As then, having the form of that slave, He pays toll and tribute not different from that which
was paid by His disciple; for the same stater sufficed, even the one coin which was paid for
Jesus and His disciple. But this coin was not in the house of Jesus, but it was in the sea, and
in the mouth of a fish of the sea which, in my judgment, was benefited when it came up and
was caught in the net of Peter, who became a fisher of men, in which net was that which is
figuratively called a fish, in order also that the coin with the image of Cæsar might be taken
from it, and that it might take its place among those which were caught by them who have
learned to become fishers of men. Let him, then, who has the things of Cæsar render them
to Cæsar,5907 that afterwards he may be able to render to God the things of God. But since
Jesus, who was “the image of the invisible God,”5908 had not the image of Cæsar, for “the
prince of this age had nothing in Him,”5909 on this account He takes from its own place,
the sea, the image of Cæsar, that He may give it to the kings of the earth for Himself and
His disciple, so that those who receive the half-shekel might not imagine that Jesus was the
debtor of them and of the kings of the earth; for He paid the debt, not having taken it up,
nor having possessed it, nor having acquired it, nor at any time having made it His own
possession, so that the image of Cæsar might never be along with the image of the invisible
God.</p>

<head>11. The Freedom of Sons.</head>
<p>And this may be put in another way. There are some who are kings’ sons on the earth,
and yet they are not sons of those kings, but sons, and sons absolutely; but others, because
of their being strangers to the sons of the kings of the earth, and sons of no one of those
upon the earth, but on this very account are sons, whether of God or of His Son, or of some
one of those who are God’s. If, then, the Saviour inquires of Peter, saying, “The kings of
the earth from whom do they receive toll or tribute—from their own sons or from
strangers?”5910 and Peter replies not from their own sons, but “from strangers,” then Jesus
says about such as are strangers to the kings of the earth, and on account of being free are
sons, “Therefore the sons are free;”5911 for the sons of the kings of the earth are not free,
since “every one that committeth sin is the bond-servant of sin,”5912 but they are free who
abide in the truth of the word of God, and on this account, know the truth, that they also
may become free from sin. If, any one then, is a son simply, and not in this matter wholly
a son of the kings of the earth, he is free. And nevertheless, though he is free, he takes care
not to offend even the kings of the earth, and their sons, and those who receive the halfshekel;
wherefore He says, “Let us not cause them to stumble, but go thou and cast thy net,
and take up the fish that first cometh up,”5913 etc. But I would inquire of those who are
pleased to make myths about different natures, of what sort of nature they were, whether
the kings of the earth, or their sons, or those who receive the half-shekel, whom the Saviour
does not wish to offend; it appears of a verity, ex hypothesi, that they are not of a nature
worthy of praise, and yet He took heed not to cause them to stumble, and He prevents any
stumbling-block being put in their way, that they may not sin more grievously, and that
with a view to their being saved—if they will—even by receiving Him who has spared them
from being caused to stumble. And as in a place verily of consolation,—for such is, by interpretation,
Capernaum,—comforting the disciple as being both free and a son, He gives
to him the power of catching the fish first, that when it came up Peter might be comforted
by its coming up and being caught, and by the stater being taken from its mouth, in order
to be paid to those whose the stater was, and who demanded as their own such a piece of
money.</p>

<p>But you might sometimes gracefully apply the passage to the lover of money, who has
nothing in his mouth but things about silver, when you behold him healed by some Peter,
who takes the stater, which is the symbol of all his avarice, not only from his mouth and
words, but from his whole character. For you will say that such an one was in the sea, and
in the bitter affairs of life, and in the waves of the cares and anxieties of avarice, having the
stater in his mouth when he was unbelieving and avaricious, but that he came up from the
sea and was caught in the rational net, and being benefited by some Peter who has taught
him the truth, no longer has the stater in his mouth, but in place of it those things which
contain His image, the oracles of God.</p>

<p>Moreover to the saying, “They that received the half-shekel came to Peter,”5914 you will
adduce from Numbers that, for the saints according to the law of God, is paid not a halfshekel
simply, but a sacred half-shekel. For it is written, “And thou shalt take five shekels
per head, according to the sacred half-shekel.”5915 But also on behalf of all the sons of Israel
is given a sacred half-shekel per head. Since then it was not possible for the saint of God to
possess along with the sacred half-shekels the profane shekels, so to speak, on this account,
to them who do not receive the sacred half-shekels, and who asked Peter and said, “Doth
not your master pay the half-shekel?” the Saviour commands the stater to be paid, in which
was the half-shekel which was found in the mouth of the first fish that came up, in order
that it might be given for the Teacher and the disciple.</p>

<head>14. Concerning Those Who Said, Who is the Greatest? and Concerning the Child
that Was Called by Jesus.</head>
<p>“In that day came the disciples unto Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of
heaven?”5916 In order that we might be taught what it was that the disciples came to Jesus
and asked to learn of Him, and how He answered to their inquiry, Matthew, though he
might have given an account of this very thing only, has added, according to some manuscripts,
“In that hour the disciples came unto Jesus,” but, according to others, “In that day;”
and it is necessary that we should not leave the meaning of the evangelist without examination.
Wherefore giving attention to the words preceding “in that day,” or “hour,” let us see
if it is possible from them to find a way to understand, as being necessary, the addition, “in
that day,” or “hour.” Jesus then had come to Capernaum along with His disciples, where
“they that received the half-shekel came to Peter,” and asked and said, “Doth not your
Master pay the half-shekel?” Then, when Peter answered and said to them, Yea, Jesus giving
further a defence with reference to the giving of the half-shekel, sends Peter to drag up the
fish into the net, in the mouth of which He said that a stater would be found which was to
be given for Himself and Peter. It seems to me, then, that thinking that this was a very great
honour which had been bestowed on Peter by Jesus, who judged that he was greater than
the rest of His friends, they wished to learn accurately the truth of their suspicion, by making
inquiry of Jesus and hearing from Him, whether, as they supposed, He had judged that Peter
was greater than they; and at the same time also they hoped to learn the ground on which
Peter had been preferred to the rest of the disciples. Matthew then, I think, wishing to make
this plain, has subjoined to the words “that take”—the stater, to-wit—“and give unto them
for thee and me,” the words, “In that day came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then
is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”5917 And, perhaps, they were also in doubt because
of the preference which had been given to the three at the transfiguration, and they were in
doubt about this—which of the three was judged by the Lord to be greatest. For John reclined
on His breast through love, and we may conclude that before the Supper they had seen many
tokens of special honour given by Jesus to John; but Peter on his confession was called
blessed in their hearing, because of his saying, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God;”5918 but again because of the saying, “Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a stumblingblock
unto Me, for thou mindest not the things of God but the things of men,”5919 they
were distracted in mind as to whether it was not he but one of the sons of Zebedee, that was

relating to the stater.</p>

<head>15. Greatness Varies in Degree.</head>
<p>But next we must seek to understand this: the disciples came to Him, as disciples to a
teacher proposing difficult questions, and making inquiry, Who then is greatest in the
kingdom of heaven?5920 And, in this respect, we must imitate the disciples of Jesus; for if,
at any time, any subject of investigation among us should not be found out let us go with
all unanimity in regard to the question in dispute to Jesus, who is present where two or three
are gathered together in His name,5921 and is ready by His presence with power to illumine
the hearts of those who truly desire to become His disciples, with a view to their apprehension
of the matters under inquiry. And likewise it would be nothing strange for us to go to any
of those who have been appointed by God as teachers in the church, and propose any
question of a like order to this, “Who, then, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” What,
then, was already known to the disciples of the matters relating to this question? And what
was the point under inquiry? That there is not equality in regard to those who are deemed
worthy of the kingdom of heaven they had apprehended, and that, as there was not equality,
some one was greatest, and so in succession down to the least: but of what nature was the
greatest, and what was the way of life of him who was the least, and who occupied the middle
position, they further desired to know; unless, indeed, it is more accurate to say that they
knew who was least from the words, “Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;” but who was
the greatest of all they did not know, even if they had grasped the meaning of the words,
“Whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
heaven;”5922 for as there were many great, it was not clear to them who was the greatest of
the great, to use a human standard. And that many are great, but the great not equally great,
will be manifest from the ascription of the epithet “great” to Isaac, “who waxed great, and
became exceedingly great,”5923 and from what is said in the case of Moses, and John the
Baptist, and the Saviour. And every one will acknowledge that even though all these were
great according to the Scripture, yet the Saviour was greater than they. But whether John
also (than whom there was no greater among those born of women),5924 was greater than
Isaac and Moses, or whether he was not greater, but equal to both, or to one of them, it
would be hazardous to declare. And from the saying, “But Isaac, waxing great, became
greater,”5925 until he became not simply great, but with the twice repeated addition, “exceed-

ingly,” we may learn that there is a difference among the great, as one is great, and another
exceedingly great, and another exceedingly exceedingly great. The disciples, therefore, came
to Jesus and sought to learn, who was the greatest in the kingdom of heaven; and perhaps
they wished to learn, hearing from Him sometimes like this, “A certain one is greatest in
the kingdom of heaven;” but He gives a universal turn to the discourse, showing what was
the quality of him who was greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Let us seek to understand,
from what is written, to the best of our ability, who this is. “For Jesus called a little child,”5926
etc.</p>

<head>16. Why the Great are Compared to Little Children.</head>
<p>But first we may expound it in simple fashion. One, expounding the word of the Saviour
here after the simple method, might say that, if any one who is a man mortifies the lusts of
manhood, putting to death by the spirit the deeds of the body, and “always bearing about
in the body the putting to death of Jesus,”5927 to such a degree that he has the condition of
the little child who has not tasted sensual pleasures, and has had no conception of the impulses
of manhood, then such an one is converted, and has become as the little children.
And the greater the advance he has made towards the condition of the little children in regard
to such emotions, by so much the more as compared with those who are in training and
have not advanced to so great a height of self-control, is he the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven. But that which has been said about little children in respect of lustful pleasures,
the same might also be said in regard to the rest of the affections and infirmities and sicknesses
of the soul, into which it is not the nature of little children to fall, who have not yet
fully attained to the possession of reason; as, for example, that, if any one be converted, and,
though a man, such an one becomes as a child in respect of anger; and, as is the child in relation
to grief, so that sometimes he laughs and plays at the very time that his father or
mother or brother is dead, he who is converted would become such an one as little children;
and, having received from the Word a disposition incapable of grief, so that he becomes
like the little child in regard to grief. And the like you will say about what is called pleasure,
in regard to which the wicked are irrationally lifted up, from which little children do not
suffer, nor such as have been converted and become as little children. As, then, it has been
accurately demonstrated also by others, that no passion is incident to the little children who
have not yet attained to full possession of reason; and if no passion, clearly fear also; but, if
there be anything corresponding to the passions, these are faint, and very quickly suppressed,
and healed in the case of little children, so that he is worthy of love, who, being converted
as the little children, has reached such a point as to have, as it were, his passions in subjection
like the little children. And with regard to fear, therefore, similar things to those spoken
might be conceived, that the little children do not experience the fear of the wicked, but a
different thing, to which those who have an accurate knowledge of questions in regard to
the passions and their names give the name of fear; as, for example, in the case of children
there is a forgetfulness of their evils at the very time of their tears, for they change in a moment,
and laugh and play along with those who were thought to grieve and terrify them,
but in truth had wrought in them no such emotion. So too, moreover, one will humble
himself like the little child which Jesus called; for neither haughtiness, nor conceit in respect
of noble birth, or wealth, or any of those things which are thought to be good, but are not,
comes to a little child. Wherefore you may see those who are not altogether infants, up to
<note type="footnote">5927 2 Cor. iv. 10.</note>

<pb n="964"/>
three or four years of age, like to those who are of mean birth, though they may seem to be
of noble birth, and not appearing at all to love rich children rather than the poor. If, therefore,
in the same way as according to their age children are affected towards those passions which
exalt the senseless, the disciple of Jesus under the influence of reason5928 has humbled
himself like the little child which Jesus showed, not being exalted because of vainglory, nor
puffed up on the ground of wealth, or raiment, nor elated because of noble birth, in particular
are they to be received and imitated in the name of Jesus, who have been converted as
the Word showed, like the little child which Jesus took to Him; since especially in such the
Christ is, and therefore He says, “Whosoever shall receive one such little child in My name
receiveth Me.”5929</p>

<head>17. The Little Ones and Their Stumbling-Blocks.</head>
<p>But it is a hard task to expound what follows in logical harmony with what has already
been said; for one might say, how is it that he who is converted and has become as the little
children, is a little one among such as believe in Jesus, and is capable of being caused to
stumble? And likewise let us attempt to explain this coherently. Every one that gives his
adherence to Jesus as the Son of God according to the true history concerning Him, and by
deeds done according to the Gospel, is on the way to living the life which is according to
virtue, is converted and is on the way towards becoming as the little children; and it is impossible
for him not to enter into the kingdom of heaven. There are, indeed, many such;
but not all, who are converted with a view to becoming like the little children, have reached
the point of being made like unto little children; but each wants so much of the likeness to
the little children, as he falls short of the disposition of little children towards the passions,
of which we have spoken. In the whole multitude, then, of believers, are also those who,
having been, as it were, just converted in regard to their becoming as the little children, at
the very point of their conversion that they may become as the little children, are called
little; and those of them, who are converted that they may become as the little children, but
fall far short of having truly become as the little children, are capable of being caused to
stumble; each of whom falls so far short of the likeness to them, as he falls short of the disposition
of children towards the passions, of which we have spoken, to whom we ought not
to give occasions of stumbling-block; but, if it be otherwise, he who has caused him to
stumble will require, as contributing towards his cure, to have “an ass’s millstone hanged
about his neck, and be sunk into the depths of the sea.”5930 For, in this way, when he has
paid the due penalty in the sea, where is “the dragon which God formed to play in it,”5931
and, so far as is expedient for the end in view, has been punished and undergone suffering,
he shall then5932 have his part in those troubles which belong to the depths of the sea, which
he endured when he was dragged down by the ass’s millstone. For there are also differences
of millstones, so that one of them may be, so to call it, the millstone of a man, and another
that of an ass; and that is human, about which it is written, “Two women shall be grinding
at the mill; one is taken and one is left;”5933 but the millstone of the ass is that which shall
be put round him who has given occasion of stumbling-block. But some one might say—I
know not whether he would speak soundly or erroneously—that the ass’s millstone is the
heavy body of the wicked man, which is sunken downwards, and which he will receive at
the resurrection that he may be sunk in the abyss which is called the depth of the sea, where

“is the dragon which God formed to play therein.”5934 But another will refer the creating
of a stumbling-block to one of the little ones to the powers that are unseen by men; for from
these arise many stumbling-blocks to the little ones pointed out by Jesus. But when they
cause to stumble one of the little ones pointed out by Jesus, who are believers in Him, he
shall assume an ass’s millstone, the corruptible body which presses heavily on the soul,
which is itself hung from the neck, which is dragged down to the affairs in this life, that by
means of these their conceit may be taken away, and having paid the penalty, they shall
come, through means of the ass’s millstone, to the condition expedient for them.</p>

<head>18. Who Was the Little Child Called by Jesus.</head>
<p>Now another interpretation different from what is called the simpler may be uttered;
whether as dogma, or for the sake of exercise, so to speak, let us also inquire what was the
little child who was called by Jesus and set in the midst of the disciples. Now consider if
you can say that the little child, whom Jesus called, was the Holy Spirit who humbled Himself,
when He was called by the Saviour, and set in the midst of the reason of the disciples of Jesus;
if, indeed, He wishes us, being turned away from everything else, to be turned towards the
examples suggested by the Holy Spirit, so that we may so become as the little children, who
are themselves also turned and likened to the Holy Spirit; which little children God gave to
the Saviour, according to what is said in Isaiah, “Behold, I and the little children which God
has given to me.”5935 And it is not possible for any one to enter into the kingdom of heaven,
who has not been turned away from the affairs of this world, and made like unto the little
children who possess the Holy Spirit; which Holy Spirit was called by Jesus, and, descending
from His own perfection to men as a little child, was set by Jesus in the midst of the disciples.
It is necessary, then, for him who has turned away from the desires of this world to humble
himself not simply as the little child, but, according to what is written, “as this little child.”5936
But to humble oneself as that little child is to imitate the Holy Spirit, who humbled Himself
for the salvation of men. Now, that the Saviour and the Holy Spirit were sent by the Father
for the salvation of men has been declared in Isaiah, in the person of the Saviour, saying,
“And now the Lord hath sent me and His Spirit.”5937 You must know, however, that this
expression is ambiguous; for either God sent, but also the Holy Spirit sent, the Saviour; or,
as we have taken it, the Father sent both—the Saviour and the Holy Spirit. He, therefore,
who has humbled himself more than all those who have humbled themselves in imitation
of that little child, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. For there are many who are
willing to humble themselves as that little child; but the man, who in every respect has become
like to the little child who humbled himself, in the name of Jesus—especially in Jesus Himself,—
in reality, would be found to be he who is named greater than all in the kingdom of
heaven. But as he receives Jesus, whosoever receives one such of the little children in His
name, so he rejects Jesus and casts Him out, who does not wish to receive one such little
child in the name of Jesus. But if, also, there is a difference in those who are deemed worthy
of the Holy Spirit, as believers receive more or less of the Holy Spirit, there would be some
little ones among those who believe in God who can be made to stumble: to avenge whose
being made to stumble the Word says, with reference to those who had caused them to
stumble, “It is profitable for him that an ass’s millstone should be hanged about his neck,

<pb n="968"/>
and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.”5938 Let these things be said in regard
to the passage of Matthew before us.</p>

<head>19. The Parallel Passages in Mark and Luke.</head>
<p>But let us consider also the like account in the other Evangelists. Mark,5939 then, says,
that the Twelve reasoned in the way as to which of them was the greatest. Wherefore He
sat down, and called them, and teaches who is the greatest, saying, that he who became last
of all by means of his moderation and gentleness, would as the greatest obtain the first place,
so that he did not receive the place of one who was being ministered unto, but the place of
one who ministered, and that not to some but not to others, but to all absolutely; for attend
to the words, “If any man would be first he shall be last of all, and minister of all.”5940 And
next to that He says, that “He,”—Jesus to-wit—“took a little child, and set him in the midst
of His own disciples, and taking him in His arms, He said unto them, Whosoever shall receive
one of the little children in My name receiveth Me.”5941 But what was the little child which
Jesus took and placed in His arms, according to the deeper meaning in the passage? Was
it the Holy Spirit? And to this little child, indeed, some were likened, of whom He said,
“Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in My name receiveth Me.” According
to Luke, however, the reasoning did not arise spontaneously in the disciples, but was suggested
to them by the question, “which of them should be greatest.”5942 And Jesus, seeing the
reasoning of their heart, as He had eyes that see the reasonings of hearts,—seeing the reasoning
of their heart,—without being questioned, according to Luke, “took the little child
and set him,” not in the midst alone, as Matthew and Mark have said, but now, also, “by
His side,” and said to the disciples, not only, “Whosoever shall receive one such little child,”
or, “Whosoever shall receive one of such little ones in My name receiveth Me,” but, now
going even a step higher, “Whosoever shall receive this little child in My name receiveth
Me.”5943 It is necessary, therefore, according to Luke, to receive in the name of Jesus that
very little child which Jesus took and placed by His side. And I know not if there be any
one who can interpret figuratively the word, “Whosoever shall receive this little child in My
name.” For it is necessary that each of us should receive in the name of Jesus that little child
which Jesus then took and set by His side; for he lives as immortal, and we must receive him
from Jesus Himself in the name of Jesus; and without being separated from him, Jesus is
with him who receives the little child, so that according to this it is said, “Whosoever shall
receive this little child in My name receiveth Me.” Then, since the Father is inseparable
from the Son, He is with him who receives the Son. Wherefore it is said, “And whosoever

shall receive Me receives Him that sent Me.”5944 But he who has received the little child,
and the Saviour, and Him that sent Him, is least of all the disciples of Jesus, making himself
little. But, so far as he belittles himself, to that extent does he become great; as that very
thing, which caused him the more to make himself little, contributes to his advance in
greatness; for attend to what is said, “He that is least among you all the same is great;” but
in other manuscripts we read, “The same shall be great.” Now, according to Luke, “If any
one shall not receive the kingdom of God as the little child, he shall in no wise enter
therein.”5945 And this expression is ambiguous; for either it means that he who receives
the kingdom of God may become as a little child, or, that he may receive the kingdom of
God, which has become to him as a little child. And perhaps here those who receive the
kingdom of God receive it, when it is as a little child, but in the world to come no longer as
a little child; and they receive the greatness of the perfection in the spiritual manhood, so
to speak, which perfection is manifested to all who in the present time receive it, when it is
here as a little child.</p>

<head>20. The World and Offences. Various Meanings of World.</head>
<p>“Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling.”5946 The expression “cosmos,”
is used in itself and absolutely in the passage, “He was in the cosmos and the cosmos knew
Him not,”5947 but it is used relatively and in respect of its connection with that of which it
is the cosmos, in the words, “Lest you look up to the heaven, and seeing the sun, and the
moon, and all the cosmos of the heavens, you should stray and bow down to them and
worship them.”5948 And the like you will find in the Book of Esther, spoken about her,
when it is written, stripping off all her “cosmos.”5949 For the word “cosmos,” simply, is not
the same as the “cosmos” of heaven, or the “cosmos” of Esther; and this which we are now
investigating is another. I think, then, that the world is not this compacted whole of heaven
and earth according to the Divine Scriptures, but only the place which is round about the
earth, and this is not to be conceived in respect of the whole earth, but only in respect of
ours which is inhabited; for the true light “was in the world,” that is, in the place which is
around, conceived in relation to our part of the earth; “and the world knew Him not,”5950
that is, the men in the region round about, and perhaps also the powers that have an affinity
to this place. For it is monstrous to understand by the world here the compacted whole
formed of heaven and earth, and those in it; so that it could be said, that the sun and moon
and the choir of the stars and the angels in all this world, did not know the true light, and,
though ignorant of it, preserved the order which God had appointed for them. But when
it is said by the Saviour in the prayer to the Father, “And, now, glorify me, O Father, with
Thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was,”5951 you must
understand by the “world,” that which is inhabited by us on the earth; for it was from this
world that the Father gave men to the Son, in regard to whom alone the Saviour beseeches
His Father, and not for the whole world of men. Moreover, also, when the Saviour says,
“And I come to thee and am no longer in the world,”5952 He speaks of the terrestrial world;
for it is not to be supposed that He spoke things contradictory when He said, “And I come
to thee, and I am no longer in the world,” and “I am in the world.” But also in this, “And
these things I speak in the world,”5953 we must think of the place round about the earth.

And this is clearly indicated also by the words, “And the world hated them, because they
are not of the world.”5954 For it hated us from the time when we no longer “look at the
things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen,”5955 because of the teaching of
Jesus; not the world of heaven and earth and them that are therein, all compacted together
but the men on the earth along with us. And the saying, “They are not of the world,”5956
is equivalent to, They are not of the place round about the earth. And so also the disciples
of Jesus are not of this world, as He was not of the world. And further also the saying, “That
the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me,”5957 twice spoken in the Gospel according
to John, does not refer to the things that are superior to men, but to men who need to believe
that the Father sent the Son into the world here. Yea, and also in the Apostle, “Your faith
is proclaimed in the whole world.”5958</p>

<head>21. The “Woe” Does Not Apply to the Disciples of Jesus.</head>
<p>But if there is woe unto men everywhere on the earth, because of occasions of stumbling
to those who are laid hold of by them; but the disciples are not of the world, as they do not
look at things seen, like as the Master is not of this world; to no one of the disciples of Jesus
does the “woe because of occasions of stumbling” apply, since “great peace have they who
love the law of God, and there is to them no occasion of stumbling.”5959 But if any one
seems to be called a disciple, but yet is of the world, because of his loving the world, and the
things therein,—I mean, the life in the place round about the earth, and the property in it,
or the possessions, or any form of wealth whatsoever,—so that the saying, “they are not of
the world,”5960 does not fit him; to him, as being really of the world, shall come that which
happens to the world, the “woe, because of occasions of stumbling.” But let him who wishes
to avoid this woe not be a lover of life, but let him say with Paul,” “The world is crucified
unto me, and I unto the world.”5961 For the saints while “in the tabernacle, do groan being
burdened”5962 with “the body of humiliation,” and do all things that they may become
worthy to be found in the mystery of the resurrection, when God shall fashion anew the
body of humiliation not of all, but of those who have been truly made disciples to Christ,
so that it may be conformed to the body of the glory of Christ.5963 For as none of the “woes”
happen to any of the disciples of Christ, so does not this “woe, because of occasions of
stumbling;” for, supposing that thousands of occasions should arise, they shall not touch
those who are no longer of the world. But if any one, because of his faith wanting ballast,
and the instability of his submission in regard to the Word of God, is capable of being caused
to stumble, let him know that he is not called by Jesus His disciple. Now we must suppose
that so many stumbling-blocks come, that, as a result, the woes extend not to some parts of
the earth, but to the whole “world” which is in it.</p>

<head>22. What the “Occasions of Stumbling” Are.</head>
<p>“And it must needs be that occasions of stumbling come,”5964 which I take to be different
from the men by whom they come. The occasions then which come are an army of the
devil, his angels, and a wicked band of impure spirits, which, seeking out instruments through
whom they will work, often find men altogether strangers to piety, and sometimes even
some of those who are thought to believe the Word of God, for whom exists a worse woe
than that which comes to him who is caused to stumble, just as also it shall be more tolerable
for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment,5965 than for the places where Jesus did signs
and wonders, and yet was not believed. But as one might undertake to make a collection
from the Scriptures of those who are pronounced blessed, and of the things in respect of
which they are so called, so also he might undertake to do with the woes which are written,
and those in whose case the woes are spoken. But that the woe is worse in the case of him
who causes to stumble, than in him who is made to stumble, you may prove by the passage,
“Whoso shall cause to stumble one of these little ones which believe in Me, it is profitable
for him,”5966 etc.; for, while the little one who is made to stumble receives retribution from
him who caused him to stumble, it is expedient that the severe and intolerable punishment
which is written should befall the man who has caused the stumbling. But if we were to
give more careful consideration to these things, we should be on our guard against sinning
against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, lest we sin against
Christ;5967 as often our brethren about us, “for whom Christ died,” perish, not only through
our knowledge, but also through some other causes connected with us; in the case of whom,
we, sinning against Christ, shall pay the penalty, the soul of them who perish through us
being required of us.</p>

<head>23. In What Sense “Necessary.”</head>
<p>Next we must test accurately the meaning of the word “necessity” in the passage, “For
there is a necessity that the occasions come,”5968 and to the like effect in Luke, “It is ‘inadmissible’
but that occasions of stumbling should come,”5969 instead of “impossible.” And as it
is necessary that that which is mortal should die, and it is impossible but that it should die,
and as it must needs be that he who is in the body should be fed, for it is impossible for one
who is not fed to live, so it is necessary and impossible but that occasions of stumbling
should arise, since there is a necessity also that wickedness should exist before virtue in men,
from which wickedness stumbling-blocks arise; for it is impossible that a man should be
found altogether sinless, and who, without sin, has attained to virtue. For the wickedness
in the evil powers, which is the primal source of the wickedness among men, is altogether
eager to work through certain instruments against the men in the world. And perhaps also
the wicked powers are more exasperated when they are cast out by the word of Jesus, and
their worship is lessened, their customary sacrifices not being offered unto them; and there
is a necessity that these offences come; but there is no necessity that they should come
through any particular one; wherefore the “woe” falls on the man through whom the
stumbling-block comes, as he has given a place to the wicked power whose purpose it is to
create a stumbling-block. But do not suppose that by nature, and from constitution, there
are certain stumbling-blocks which seek out men through whom they come; for as God did
not make death, so neither did He create stumbling-blocks; but free-will begot the stumblingblocks
in some who did not wish to endure toils for virtue.</p>

<head>24. The Offending Hand, or Foot, or Eye.</head>
<p>And it is well, then, if the eye and the hand are deserving of praise, that the eye cannot
with reason say to the hand, “I have no need of thee.”5970 But if any one in the whole body
of the congregations of the church, who because of his practical gifts has the name of hand,
should change and become a hand causing to stumble, let the eye say to such a hand, “I have
no need of thee,” and, saying it, let him cut it off and cast it from him.5971 And so it is well,
if any head be blessed, and the feet worthy of the blessed head, so that the head observing
the things which are becoming to itself, may not be able to say to the feet, “I have no need
of you.” If, however, any foot be found to become a stumbling-block to the whole body, let
the head say to such a foot, “I have no need of thee,” and having cast it off, let him cast it
from himself; for even it is much better that the rest of the body should enter into life,
wanting the foot or the hand which caused the stumbling-block, rather than, when the
stumbling-block has spread over the whole body, it should be cast into the hell of fire with
the two feet or the two hands. And so it is well, that he who can become the eye of the whole
body should be worthy of Christ and of the whole body; but if such an eye should ever
change, and become a stumbling-block to the whole body, it is well to take it out and cast
it outside the whole body, and that the rest of the body without that eye should be saved,
rather than that along with it, when the whole body has been corrupted, the whole body
should be cast into the hell of fire.5972 For the practical faculty of the soul, if prone to sin,
and the walking faculty of the soul, so to speak, if prone to sin, and the faculty of clear vision,
if prone to sin, may be the hand that causes to stumble, and the foot that causes to stumble,
and the eye that causes to stumble, which things it is better to cast away, and having put
them aside to enter into life without them, like as one halt, or maimed, or one-eyed, rather
than along with them to lose the whole soul. And likewise in the case of the soul it is a good
and blessed thing to use its power for the noblest ends; but if we are going to lose one for
any cause, it is better to lose the use of it, that along with the other powers we may be saved.</p>

<head>25. The Eye or Hand Allegorized.</head>
<p>And it is possible to apply these words also to our nearest kinsfolk, who are our members,
as it were; being considered to be our members, because of the close relationship; whether
by birth, or from any habitual friendship, so to speak; whom we must not spare if they are
injuring our soul. For let us cut off from ourselves as a hand or a foot or an eye, a father or
mother who wishes us to do that which is contrary to piety, and a son or daughter who, as
far as in them lies, would have us revolt from the church of Christ and the love of Him. But
even if the wife of our bosom, or a friend who is kindred in soul, become stumbling-blocks
to us, let us not spare them, but let us cut them out from ourselves, and cast them outside
of our soul, as not being truly our kindred but enemies of our salvation; for “whosoever
hates not his father, and mother,”5973 and the others subjoined, when it is the fitting season
to hate them as enemies and assailants, that he may be able to win Christ, this man is not
worthy of the Son of God. And in respect of these we may say, that from a critical position
any lame one, so to speak, is saved, when he has lost a foot—say a brother—and alone obtains
the inheritance of the kingdom of God; and a maimed one is saved, when his father is not
saved, but they perish, while he is separated from them, that he alone may obtain the bene-
dictions. And so also any one is saved with one eye, who has cut out the eye of his own
house, his wife, if she commit fornication, lest having two eyes he may go away into the hell
of fire.</p>

<head>26. The Little Ones and Their Angels.</head>
<p>“See that ye despise not one of these little ones.”5974 It seems to me that as among the
bodies of men there are differences in point of size,—so that some are little, and others great,
and others of middle height, and, again, there are differences among the little, as they are
more or less little, and the same holds of the great, and of those of middle height,—so also
among the souls of men, there are some things which give them the stamp of littleness, and
other things the stamp of greatness, so to speak, and generally, after the analogy of things
bodily, other things the stamp of mediocrity. But in the case of bodies, it is not due to the
action of men but to the spermatic principles, that one is short and little, another great, and
another of middle height; but in the case of souls, it is our free-will, and actions of such a
kind, and habits of such a kind, that furnish the reason why one is great, or little, or of middle
height; and it is of our free-will either by advancing in stature to increase our size, or not
advancing to be short. And so indeed I understand the words about Jesus having assumed
a human soul, “Jesus advanced;”5975 for as from the free-will there was an advance of His
soul in wisdom and grace, so also in stature. And the Apostle says, “Until we all attain unto
a full-grown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ;”5976 for we must
think that he attains unto a man, and that full-grown, according to the inner man, who has
gone through the things of the child, and has reached the stage of the man, and has put away
the things of the child, and generally, has perfected the things of the man.5977 And so we
must suppose that there is a certain measure of spiritual stature unto which the most perfect
soul can attain by magnifying the Lord, and become great. Thus, then, these became great,
of whom this is written, Isaac, and Moses, and John, and the Saviour Himself above all; for
also about Him Gabriel said, “He shall be great;”5978 but the little ones are “the newborn
babes which long for the reasonable milk which is without guile,”5979 such as stand in need
of nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers, spoken of in Isaiah when he says, about the calling
from the Gentiles, “And they shall bring the sons in the bosom, and take their daughters on
the shoulders, and kings shall be thy nursing-fathers and their princesses thy nursingmothers.”
5980 For these reasons you will, then, attend to the word, “Do not despise one of
these little ones,”5981 and consider whether it is their angels who bring them in their bosom,

since they have become sons, and also take on their shoulders what are called daughters,
and whether from them are the nursing-fathers who are called kings, and the nursingmothers
who are called princesses. And since the little ones, pointed out by our Saviour,
are under the stewardship as of nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers, on this account I
think that Moses, who believed that he had been already assigned a place among the ranks
of the great, said, with regard to the promise, “My angel shall go before you,”5982 “If thou
thyself do not go along with me, carry me not up hence.”5983 For though the little one even
be an heir, yet as being a child he differs nothing from a servant when he is a child,5984 and
to the extent to which he is little “has the spirit of bondage to fear;”5985 but he who is not
at all any longer such has no longer the spirit of bondage, but already the spirit of adoption,
when “perfect love casteth out fear;”5986 it will be plain to thee, how that according to these
things “the angel of the Lord” is said “to encamp round about them that fear Him, and to
save them.”5987 But you will consider, according to these things also, whether these are indeed
angels of the little ones “who are led by the spirit of bondage to fear,” “when the angel
of the Lord encamps round about them that fear Him and delivereth them;” but of the great,
whether it is the Lord who is greater than the angels, who might say about each of them, “I
am with him in affliction;”5988 and, so long as we are imperfect, and need one to assist us
that we may be delivered from evils, we stand in need of an angel of whom Jacob said, “The
angel who delivered me from all the evils;”5989 but, when we have become perfected, and
have passed through the stage of being subject to nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers and
guardians and stewards,5990 we are meet to be governed by the Lord Himself.</p>

<head>27. When the Little Ones are Assigned to Angels.</head>
<p>Then again one might inquire at what time those who are called their angels assume
guardianship of the little ones pointed out by Christ; whether they received this commission
to discharge concerning them, from what time “by the laver of regeneration,”5991 through
which they were born “as new-born babes, they long for the reasonable milk which is without
guile,”5992 and no longer are in subjection to any wicked power; or, whether from birth they
had been appointed, according to the foreknowledge and predestination of God, over those
whom God also foreknew, and foreordained to be conformed to the glory of the Christ.5993
And with reference to the view that they have angels from birth, one might quote, “He who
separated me from my mother’s womb,”5994 and, “From the womb of my mother thou hast
been my protector,”5995 and, “He has assisted me from my mother’s womb,”5996 and, “Upon
thee I was cast from my mother,”5997 and in the Epistle of Jude, “To them that are beloved

<head>28. Close Relationship of Angels to Their “Little Ones.”</head>
<p>With reference to the words, “When through the laver I became a child in Christ,”5999
it may be said, that there is no holy angel present with those who are still in wickedness, but
that during the period of unbelief they are under the angels of Satan;6000 but, after the regeneration,
He who has redeemed us with His own blood consigns us to a holy angel, who
also, because of his purity, beholds the face of God. And a third exposition of this passage
might be something like the following, which would say, that as it is possible for a man to
change from unbelief to faith, and from intemperance to temperance, and generally from
wickedness to virtue, so also it is possible that the angel, to whom any soul has been entrusted
at birth, may be wicked at the first, but afterwards may at some time believe in proportion
as the man believes, and may make such advance that he may become one of the angels who
always behold the face of the Father in heaven,6001 beginning from the time that he is yoked
along with the man who was foreknown and foreordained to believe at that time, the judgments
of God, which are unspeakable and unsearchable and like to the depths, fitly bringing
together all this harmonious relationship—angels with men. And it may be that as when a
man and his wife are both unbelievers, sometimes it is the man who first believes and in
time saves his wife, and sometimes the wife who begins and afterwards in time persuades
her husband, so it happens with angels and with men. If, however, anything of this kind
takes place in the case of other angels or not, you may seek out for yourself. But consider
whether it may not be appropriate to say something of this kind in regard to each angel who
is so honoured according to the word of the Saviour, that he is said to behold always the
face of the Father who is in heaven. But since in what we said above, that the little ones have
angels, but that the great have passed beyond such a position, some one will quote in opposition
to us from the Acts of the Apostles, where it is written, that a certain maid Rhoda,
when Peter knocked at the door, came to answer, and recognizing the voice of Peter, ran in
and announced that Peter stood before the gate; but when they who were gathered together
in the house wondered, and thought that it was quite impossible that Peter verily stood before
the gate, they said, It is his angel.6002 For the objector will say that, as they had learned once
for all that each of the believers had some definite angel, they knew that Peter also had one.
But he, who adheres to what we have previously said, will say that the word of Rhoda was
not necessarily a dogma, and perhaps also the word of those who did not accurately know,
when one as being little and God-fearing is governed by angels, and when now by the Lord
Himself. After this, in order to establish our conception of the little one which we have
<note type="footnote">5999 Cf. Tit. iii. 5; 1 Pet. ii. 2.</note>

<pb n="982"/>
brought forward, it will be said that we need no command about “not despising” in the case
of the great, but we do need it in the case of the little; wherefore it is not merely said, “Do
not despise one of these,” pointing to all the disciples, but “one of these little ones,”6003
pointed out by Him, who sees the littleness and the greatness of the soul.</p>

<head>29. The Little Ones and the Perfect.</head>
<p>But another might say that the perfect man is here called little, applying the word, “For
he that is least among you all, the same is great,”6004 and will affirm that he who humbles
himself and becomes a child in the midst of all that believe, though he be an apostle or a
bishop, and becomes such “as when a nurse cherisheth her own children,”6005 is the little
one pointed out by Jesus, and that the angel of such an one is worthy to behold the face of
God. For to say that the little are here called perfect, according to the passage, “He that is
least among you all, the same is great,”6006 and as Paul said, “Unto me who am less than
the least of all saints was this grace given,”6007 will seem to be in harmony with the saying,
“Whoso shall cause one of these little ones to stumble,”6008 and “So it is not the will of My
Father in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.”6009 For he, as has been stated,
who is now little, could not be made to stumble nor perish, for “great peace have they who
love the law of God, and there is no stumbling-block to them;”6010 and he could not perish,
who is least of all among all the disciples of Christ, and on this account becomes great; and,
since he could not perish, he could say, “Who shall separate us from the love,”6011 etc. But
he who wishes to maintain this last exposition will say that the soul even of the just man is
changeable, as Ezekiel also testifies, saying, that the righteous man may abandon the commandments
of God, so that his former righteousness is not reckoned unto him;6012 wherefore
it is said, “Whoso shall cause to stumble one of these little ones,6013 and, “It is not the will
of My Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.”6014</p>

<head>30. The Sinning Brother.</head>
<p>“If thy brother sin against thee, go, shew him his fault between thee and him alone.6016”
He, then, who attends closely to the expression, in proof of the surpassing philanthropy of
Jesus, will say, that as the words do not suggest a difference of sins, they will act in a singular
manner and contrary to the goodness of Jesus, who supply the thought, that these words
are to be understood as being limited in their application to lesser sins. But another, also
attending closely to the expression, and not wishing to introduce these extraneous thoughts,
nor admitting that it is spoken about every sin, will say, that he who commits those great
sins is not a brother, even if he be called a brother, as the Apostle says, “If any one that is
named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, etc., with such an one not to
eat;”6017 for no one who is an idolater, or a fornicator, or covetous, is a brother; for if he,
who seems to bear the name of Christ, though he is named a brother, has something of the
features of these, he would not rightly be called a brother. As then he, who says that such
words are spoken about every sin, whether the sin be murder, or poisoning, or pæderasty,
or anything of that sort, would give occasion of injury to the exceeding goodness of Christ,
so, on the contrary, he who distinguishes between the brother and him who is called the
brother, might teach that, in the case of the least of the sins of men, he who has not repented
after the telling of the fault is to be reckoned as a Gentile and a publican, for sins which are
“not unto death,”6018 or, as the law has described them in the Book of Numbers, not “deathbringing.”
6019 This would seem to be very harsh; for I do not think that any one will readily
be found who has not been censured thrice for the same form of sin, say, reviling, with which
revilers abuse their neighbours, or those who are carried away by passion, or for overdrinking,
or lying and idle words, or any of those things which exist in the masses. You will
inquire, therefore, whether any observation of the passage has escaped the notice of those,
who are influenced by their conception of the goodness of the Word, and grant pardon to
those who have committed the greatest sins, as well as of those who teach that, in the case
of the very least sins, he is to be reckoned as a Gentile and a publican, making him a stranger
to the church, after he has committed three very trivial transgressions. But the following
seems to me to have been overlooked by both of them, namely, the words, “Thou hast gained
thy brother.”6020 It is assigned by the Word to him only who heard, and He no longer applies
it in the case of him who has stumbled twice or thrice and been censured; but that which

<pb n="985"/>
was to be said about him who was censured twice or thrice, corresponding to the saying,
“Thou hast gained thy brother,” He has left in the air, so to speak. He is not, therefore, altogether
gained, nor will he altogether perish, or he will receive stripes. And attend carefully
to the first passage, “If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother,” and to the second passage,
which is literally, “If he hear thee not, take with thyself one or two more, that at the mouth
of two or three witnesses every word may be established.”6021 What, then, will happen to
him who has been censured for the second time, after every word has been established by
two or three witnesses, He has left us to conceive. And, again, “If he refuse to hear
them”—manifestly, the witnesses who have been taken—“tell it,” he says, “to the church;”6022
and He does not say what he will suffer if he does not hear the church, but He taught that
if he refused to hear the church, then he who had thrice admonished, and had not been
heard, was to regard him for the future as the Gentile and the publican.6023 Therefore he
is not altogether gained, nor will he altogether perish. But what at all he will suffer, who at
first did not hear, but required witnesses, or even refused to hear these, but was brought to
the church, God knows; for we do not declare it, according to the precept, “Judge not that
ye be not judged,”6024 “until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things
of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts.”6025 But, with reference to the
seeming harshness in the case of those who have committed less sins, one might say that it
is not possible for him who has not heard twice in succession to hear the third time, so as,
on this account, no longer to be as a Gentile or a publican, or no longer to stand in need of
the censure in presence of all the church. For we must bear in mind this, “So it is not the
will of My Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.”6026 For if “we must
all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in
the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad,”6027 let each one with
all his power do what he can so that he may not receive punishment for more evil things
done in the body, even if he is going to receive back for all the wrongs which he has done;
but it should be our ambition to procure the reward for a greater number of good deeds,
since “with what measure we mete, it shall be measured to us,”6028 and, “according to the
works of our own hands shall it happen unto us,”6029 and not in infinite wise, but either

double or sevenfold shall sinners receive for their sins from the hand of the Lord; since He
does not render unto any one according to the works of his hands, but more than that which
he has done, for “Jerusalem,” as Isaiah taught, “received from the hand of the Lord double
for her sins;”6030 but the neighbours of Israel, whoever they may be, will receive sevenfold,
according to the following expression in the Psalms, “Render unto our neighbours sevenfold
into their bosom the reproach with which they have reproached Thee, O Lord.”6031 And
other forms of payment in return could be found, which, if we apprehend, we shall know
that to repent after any sin, whatever its greatness, is advantageous, in order that, in addition
to our not being punished for more offences, there may be some hope left to us concerning
good deeds done afterwards at some time, even though, before them, thousands of errors
have been committed by anyone of us. For it would be strange that evil deeds should be
reckoned to any one, but the better which are done after the bad should profit nothing;
which may also be learned from Ezekiel,6032 by those who pay careful consideration to the
things said about such cases.</p>

<head>31. The Power to Bind on Earth and in Heaven.</head>
<p>But to me it seems that, to the case of him who after being thrice admonished was adjudged
to be as the Gentile and the publican, it is fitly subjoined, “Verily, I say unto
you,”—namely, to those who have judged any one to be as the Gentile and the publican,—“
and what things soever ye shall bind on the earth,”6033 etc.; for with justice has he,
who has thrice admonished and not been heard, bound him who is judged to be as a Gentile
and a publican; wherefore, when such an one is bound and condemned by one of this
character, he remains bound, as no one of those in heaven overturns the judgment of the
man who bound him. And, in like manner, he who was admonished once for all, and did
things worthy of being gained, having been set free by the admonition of the man who
gained him, and no longer bound by the cords of his own sins,6034 for which he was admonished,
shall be adjudged to have been set free by those in heaven. Only, it seems to be indic-
ated that the things, which above were granted to Peter alone, are here given to all who give
the three admonitions to all that have sinned; so that, if they be not heard, they will bind on
earth him who is judged to be as a Gentile and a publican, as such an one has been bound
in heaven. But since it was necessary, even if something in common had been said in the
case of Peter and those who had thrice admonished the brethren, that Peter should have
some element superior to those who thrice admonished, in the case of Peter, this saying “I
will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens,”6035 has been specially set before
the words, “And what things soever ye shall bind on earth,” etc. And, indeed, if we were to
attend carefully to the evangelical writings, we would also find here, and in relation to those
things which seem to be common to Peter and those who have thrice admonished the
brethren, a great difference and a pre-eminence in the things said to Peter, compared with
the second class. For it is no small difference that Peter received the keys not of one heaven
but of more, and in order that whatsoever things he binds on the earth may be bound not
in one heaven but in them all, as compared with the many who bind on earth and loose on
earth, so that these things are bound and loosed not in the heavens, as in the case of Peter,
but in one only; for they do not reach so high a stage, with power as Peter to bind and loose
in all the heavens.6036 The better, therefore, is the binder, so much more blessed is he who
has been loosed, so that in every part of the heavens his loosing has been accomplished.</p>

<head>1. The Power of Harmony in Relation to Prayer.</head>
<p>“Again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree6037 on earth as touching anything
that they shall ask, it shall be done for them.”6038 The word symphony is strictly applied to
the harmonies of sounds in music. And there are indeed among musical sounds some accordant
and others discordant. But the Evangelic Scripture is familiar with the name as
applied to musical matters in the passage, “He heard a symphony and dancing.”6039 For it
was fitting that when the son who had been lost and found came by penitence into concord
with his father a symphony should be heard on the occasion of the joyous mirth of the
house. But the wicked Laban was not acquainted with the word symphony in his saying to
Jacob, “And if thou hadst told me I would have sent thee away with mirth and with music
and with drums and a harp.”6040 But akin to the symphony of this nature is that which is
written in the second Book of Kings when “the brethren of Aminadab went before the ark,
and David and his son played before the Lord on instruments artistically fitted with might
and with songs;”6041 for the instruments thus fitted with might and with songs, had in
themselves the musical symphony which is so powerful that when two only, bring along
with the symphony which has relation to the music that is divine and spiritual, a request to
the Father in heaven about anything whatsoever, the Father grants the request to those who
ask along with the symphony on earth,—which is most miraculous,—those things which
those who have made the symphony spoken of may have asked. So also I understand the
apostolic saying “Defraud ye not one the other except it be by agreement for a season that
ye may give yourselves unto prayer.”6042 For since the word harmony is applied to those
who marry according to God in the passage from Proverbs which is as follows: “Fathers
will divide their house and substance to their sons, but from God the woman is married to
the man,”6043 it is a logical consequence of the harmony being from God, that the name
and the deed should enjoy the agreement with a view to prayer, as is indicated in the word,
“unless it be by agreement.”6044 Then the Word repeating that the agreeing of two on the

earth is the same thing as the agreeing with Christ, adds, “For where two or three are gathered
together in My name.”6045 Therefore the two or three who are gathered together in the
name of Christ are those who are in agreement on earth, not two only but sometimes also
three. But he who has the power will consider whether this agreement and a congregation
of this sort in the midst of which Christ is, can be found in more, since “narrow and
straightened is the way that leadeth unto life, and few be they that find it.”6046 But perhaps
also not even few but two or three make a symphony as Peter and James and John, to whom
as making a symphony the Word of God showed His own glory. But two made a symphony,
Paul and Sosthenes, when writing the first Epistle to the Corinthians;6047 and after this Paul
and Timothy when sending the second Epistle to the same.6048 And even three made a
symphony when Paul and Silvanus and Timothy gave instruction by letter to the Thessalonians.
6049 But if it be necessary also from the ancient Scriptures to bring forward the three
who made a symphony on earth, so that the Word was in the midst of them making them
one, attend to the superscription of the Psalms, as for example to that of the forty-first,
which is as follows: “Unto the end, unto understanding, for the sons of Korah.”6050 For
though there were three sons of Korah whose names we find in the Book of Exodus,6051
Aser, which is, by interpretation, “instruction,” and the second Elkana, which is translated,
“possession of God,” and the third Abiasaph, which in the Greek tongue might be rendered,
“congregation of the father,” yet the prophecies were not divided but were both spoken and
written by one spirit, and one voice, and one soul, which wrought with true harmony, and
the three speak as one, “As the heart panteth after the springs of the water, so panteth my
soul after thee, O God.”6052 But also they say in the plural in the forty-fourth Psalm, “O
God, we have heard with our ears.”6053 But if you wish still further to see those who are
making symphony on earth look to those who heard the exhortation, “that ye may be perfected
together in the same mind and in the same judgment,”6054 and who strove after the
goal, “the soul and the heart of all the believers were one,”6055 who have become such, if it

be possible for such a condition to be found in more than two or three, that there is no discord
between them, just as there is no discord between the strings of the ten-stringed psaltery
with each other. But they were not in symphony in earth who said, “I am of Paul, and I of
Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ,”6056 but there were schisms among them, upon
the dissolution of which they were gathered together in company with the spirit in Paul,
with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ,6057 that they might no longer “bite and devour one
another so that they were consumed by one another;”6058 for discord consumes, as concord
brings together, and admits6059 the Son of God who comes in the midst of those who have
become at concord. And strictly, indeed, concord takes place in two things generic, through
the perfecting together, as the Apostle has called it, of the same mind by an intellectual grasp
of the same opinions, and through the perfecting together of the same judgment, by a like
way of living. But if whenever two of us agree on earth as touching anything that they shall
ask, it shall be done for them of the Father of Jesus who is in heaven,6060 plainly when this
is not done for them of the Father in heaven as touching anything that they shall ask, there
the two have not been in agreement on earth; and this is the cause why we are not heard
when we pray, that we do not agree with one another on earth, neither in opinions nor in
life. But further also if we are the body of Christ and God hath set the members each one
of them in the body that the members may have the same care one for another, and may
agree with one another, and when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it, and
if one be glorified, they rejoice with it,6061 we ought to practise the symphony which springs
from the divine music, that when we are gathered together in the name of Christ, He may
be in the midst of us, the Word of God, and the Wisdom of God, and His Power.6062</p>

<p>So much then for the more common understanding of the two or three whom the Word
exhorts to be in agreement. But now let us also touch upon another interpretation which
was uttered by some one of our predecessors, exhorting those who were married to sanctity
and purity; for by the two, he says, whom the Word desires to agree on earth, we must understand
the husband and wife, who by agreement defraud each other of bodily intercourse
that they may give themselves unto prayer;6063 when if they pray for anything whatever that
they shall ask, they shall receive it, the request being granted to them by the Father in
heaven of Jesus Christ on the ground of such agreement. And this interpretation does not
appear to me to cause dissolution of marriage, but to be an incitement to agreement, so that
if the one wished to be pure, but the other did not desire it, and on this account he who
willed and was able to fulfil the better part, condescended to the one who had not the power
or the will, they would not both have the accomplishment from the Father in heaven of Jesus
Christ, of anything whatever that they might ask.</p>

<head>3. The Harmony of Body, Soul, and Spirit.</head>
<p>And next to this about the married, I am familiar also with another interpretation of
the agreement between the two which is as follows. In the wicked, sin reigns over the soul,
being settled as on its own throne in this mortal body, so that the soul obeys the lusts
thereof;6064 but in the case of those, who have stirred up the sin which formerly reigned
over the body as from a throne and who are in conflict with it, “the flesh lusteth against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh;”6065 but in the case of those who have now become
perfected, the spirit has gained the mastery and put to death the deeds of the body, and imparts
to the body of its own life, so that already this is fulfilled, “He shall quicken also your
mortal bodies because of His Spirit that dwelleth in you;”6066 and there arises a concord of
the two, body and spirit, on the earth, on the successful accomplishment of which there is
sent up a harmonious prayer also of him who “with the heart believes unto righteousness,
but with the mouth maketh confession unto salvation,”6067 so that the heart is no longer
far from God, and along with this the righteous man draws nigh to God with his own lips
and mouth. But still more blessed is it if the three be gathered together in the name of Jesus
that this may be fulfilled, “May God sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and
body be preserved entire without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”6068 But
some one may inquire with regard to the concord of spirit and body spoken of, if it is possible
for these to be at concord without the third being so,—I mean the soul—and whether it
does not follow from the concord of these on the earth after the two have been gathered
together in the name of Christ, that the three also are already gathered together in His name,
in the midst of whom comes the Son of God as all are dedicated to Him,—I mean the
three,—and no one is opposed to Him, there being no antagonism not only on the part of
the spirit, but not even of the soul, nor further of the body.</p>

<p>And likewise it is a pleasant thing to endeavour to understand and exhibit the fact of
the concord of the two covenants,—of the one before the bodily advent of the Saviour and
of the new covenant; for among those things in which the two covenants are at concord so
that there is no discord between them would be found prayers, to the effect that about anything
whatever they shall ask it shall be done to them from the Father in heaven. And if
also you desire the third that unites the two, do not hesitate to say that it is the Holy Spirit,
since “the words of the wise,” whether they be of those before the advent, or at the time of
the advent, or after it, “are as goads, and as nails firmly fixed, which were given by agreement
from one shepherd.”6069 And do not let this also pass unobserved, that He did not say,
where two or three are gathered together in My name, there “shall I be” in the midst of them,
but “there am I,”6070 not going to be, not delaying, but at the very moment of the concord
being Himself found, and being in the midst of them.</p>

<head>5. The Limit of Forgiveness.</head>
<p>“Then came Peter and said unto Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me
and I forgive him?”6071 The conception that these things were said in a simple sense by
Peter, as if he were inquiring whether he was to forgive his brother when he sinned against
him seven times, but no longer if he sinned an eighth time, and by the Saviour, as if He
thought that one should sit still and reckon up the sins of his neighbours against him in
order that he might forgive seventy times and seven, but that from the seventy-eighth he
should not forgive the man who wronged him, seems to me altogether silly and unworthy
alike of the progress which Peter had made in the company of Jesus and of the divine magnanimity
of Jesus. Perhaps, then, these things also border on an obscurity akin to the words,
“Hear My voice, ye wives of Lamech,”6072 etc. If any one has already become a friend of
Jesus so as to be taught by His spirit which illumines the reason of him who has advanced
so far according to his desert, he might know the true meaning, therefore, in regard to these
things, and such as Jesus Himself would have clearly expounded it; but we who fall short of
the greatness of the friendship of Jesus must be content if we can babble a little about the
passage. The number six, then, appears to be working and toilsome, but the number seven
to contain the idea of repose. And consider if you can say that he, who loves the world and
works the things of the world, and does those things which are material, sins six times, and
that the number seven is the end of sin in his case, so that Peter with some such thought in
his mind wished to pardon seven sins of those which his brother had committed against
him. But since as units the tens and the hundreds have a certain common measure of proportion
to the number which is in units, and Jesus knew that the number might be exceeded,
on this account, I think, that He added to the number seven also the seventy,6073 and said
that there ought to be forgiveness to brethren here, and to them who have sinned in respect
to things here. But if any one going beyond the things about the world and this age were
to commit sin, even if it were trifling, he could not longer reasonably have forgiveness of
sins; for forgiveness extends to the things here, and in relation to the sins committed here,
whether the forgiveness comes late or soon; but there is no forgiveness, not even to a
brother, who has sinned beyond the seven and seventy times. But you might say that he
who has sinned in such wise, whether as against Peter his brother, or as against Peter, against
whom the gates of Hades do not prevail, is by sins of this kind in the smaller number of the
sin, but according to sins still worse is in the number which has no forgiveness of sins.</p>

<head>6. Concerning the King Who Made a Reckoning with His Own Servants, to Whom
Was Brought a Man Who Owed Ten Thousand Talents.</head>
<p>“Therefore I say unto you the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who
wished to make a reckoning with his own servants.”6074 The general conception of the parable
is to teach us that we should be inclined to forgive the sins committed against us by those
who have wronged us, and especially if after the wrongdoing he who has done it supplicates
him who has been wronged, asking forgiveness for the sins which he has committed against
him. And this the parable wishes to teach us by representing that even when forgiveness
has been granted by God to us of the sins in respect of which we have received remission,
exaction will be demanded even after the remission, unless we forgive the sins of those who
have wronged us, so that there is no longer left in us the least remembrance of the wrong
that was done, but the whole heart, assisted by the spirit of forgetfulness of wrongs, which
is no common virtue, forgives him who has wronged us those things which have been
wickedly done against any of us by him, even treacherously. But next to the general conception
of the parable, it is right to examine the whole of it more simply according to the letter,
so that he who advances with care to the right investigation of each detail of the things
previously written may derive profit from the examination of what is said. Now there is, as
is probable, an interpretation, transcendental and hard to trace, as it is somewhat mystical,
according to which, after the analogy of the parables which are interpreted by the Evangelists,
one would investigate each of the details in this; as, for example, who the king was, and who
the servants were, and what was the beginning of his making a reckoning, and who was the
one debtor who owed many talents, and who was his wife and who his children, and what
were the “all things” spoken of besides those which the king ordered to be sold in order that
the debt might be paid out of his belongings, and what was meant by the going out of the
man who had been forgiven the many talents, and who was the one of the servants who was
found and was a debtor not to the householder, but to the man who had been forgiven, and
what is meant by the number of the hundred pence, and what by the word, “He took him
by the throat saying, Pay what thou owest,” and what is the prison into which he who had
been forgiven all the talents went out and cast his fellow-servant, and who were the fellowservants
who were grieved and told the lord all that had been done, and who were the tormentors
to whom he who had cast his fellow-servant into prison was delivered, and how
he who was delivered to the tormentors paid all that was due, so that he no longer owed
anything.6075 But it is probable also that some other things could be added to the number
by a more competent investigator, the exposition and interpretation of which I think to be
beyond the power of man, and requiring the Spirit of Christ who spoke them in order that
<note type="footnote">6074 Matt. xviii. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">6075 Matt. xviii. 23, 34.</note>

<pb n="996"/>
Christ may be understood as He spoke; for as “no one among men knows the things of the
man, save the spirit which is in him,” and “no one knows the things of God, save the Spirit
of God,”6076 so no one knows after God the things spoken by Christ in proverbs and parables
save the Spirit of Christ, in which he who participates in Christ not only so far as He is
Spirit, but in Christ as He is Wisdom, as He is Word, would behold the things which were
revealed to him in this passage. But with regard to the interpretation of the loftiest type, we
make no profession; nor on the other hand with the assistance of Christ who is the Wisdom
of God do we despair of apprehending the things signified in the parable; but whether it
shall be the case that such things shall be dictated to us in connection with this Scripture or
not, may God in Christ suggest the doing of that which is pleasing to Him, if only there be
granted to us also concerning these things, the word of wisdom which is given from God
through the Spirit, and the word of knowledge which is supplied according to the Spirit.6077</p>

<head>7. Exposition Continued: the King and the Servants.</head>
<p>“The kingdom of heaven,” He says, “is likened,”6078 etc. But if it be likened to such a
king, and one who has done such things, who must we say that it is but the Son of God?
For He is the King of the heavens, and as He is absolute Wisdom and absolute Righteousness
and absolute Truth, is He not so also absolute Kingdom? But it is not a kingdom of any of
those below, nor of a part of those above, but of all the things above, which were called
heavens. But if you enquire into the meaning of the words, “Theirs is the kingdom of
heaven,”6079 you may say that Christ is theirs in so far as He is absolute Kingdom, reigning
in every thought of the man who is no longer under the reign of sin which reigns in the
mortal body of those who have subjected themselves to it.6080 And if I say, reigning in every
thought, I mean something like this, reigning as Righteousness and Wisdom and Truth and
the rest of the virtues in him who has become a heaven, because of bearing the image of the
heavenly, and in every power, whether angelic, or the rest that are named saints, not only
in this age, but also in that which is to come, and who are worthy of a kingdom of such a
kind. Accordingly this kingdom of heaven (when it was made “in the likeness of sinful
flesh,”6081 that for sin it might condemn sin, when God made “Him who knew no sin to be
sin on behalf of us,”6082 who bear the body of our sin), is likened to a certain king who is
understood in relation to Jesus being united to Him, if we may dare so to speak, having
more capacity towards being united and becoming entirely one with the “First-born of all
creation,”6083 than he, who, being joined to the Lord, becomes one spirit with Him.6084
Now of this kingdom of the heavens which is likened unto a certain king, according to the
conception of Jesus, and is united to Him, it is said by anticipation that he wished to make
a reckoning with his servants. But he is about to make a reckoning with them in order that
it may be manifested how each has employed the tried money of the householder and his
rational coins. And the image in the parables was indeed taken from masters who made a
reckoning with their own servants; but we shall understand more accurately what is signified
by this part of the parable, if we fix our thought on the things done by the slaves who had
administered their master’s goods, and who were asked to give a reckoning concerning
them. For each of them, receiving in different measure from his master’s goods, has used
them either for that which was right so as to increase the goods of his master, or consumed

<pb n="998"/>
it riotously on things which he ought not, and spent profusely without judgment and without
discretion that which had been put into his hands. But there are those who have wisely administered
these goods and goods so great, but have lost others, and whenever they give the
reckoning when the master makes a reckoning with them, there is gathered together how
much loss each has incurred, and there is reckoned up how much gain each has brought,
and according to the worthiness of the way in which he has administered it, he is either
honoured or punished, or in some cases the debt is forgiven, but in others the talents are
taken away. Well, then, from what has been said, let us first look at the rational coins and
the tried money of the householder, of which one receives more and another less, for according
to the ability of each, to one are given five talents as he has the ability to administer so
many, but to another two as not being able to receive the amount of the man before him,
and to another one as being also inferior to the second.6085 Are these, then, the only differences,
or are we to recognize these differences in the case of certain persons of whom the
Gospel goes on to speak while there are also others besides these: In other parables also are
found certain persons, as the two debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence, and the
other fifty;6086 but whether these had been entrusted with them and had administered them
badly as being inferior in ability to him who had been entrusted with a talent, or had received
them, we have not learned; but that they owed so much, we seem to be taught from the
parable. And there are found other ten servants who were each entrusted with a pound
separately.6087 And if any one understood the varied character of the human soul and the
wide differences from each other in respect of natural aptitude, or want of aptitude for more
or fewer of the virtues, and for these virtues or for those, perhaps he would comprehend
how each soul has come with certain coins of the householder which come to light with the
full attainment of reason, and with the attention which follows the full attainment of reason,
and with exercise in things that are right, or with diligence and exercise in other things,
whether they be useful as pursuits, or in part useful and in part not useful, such as the
opinions which are not wholly true nor wholly false.</p>

<head>8. The Principle of the Reckoning.</head>
<p>But you will here inquire whether all men can be called servants of the king, or some
are servants whom he foreknew and fore-ordained, while there are others who transact
business with the servants, and are called bankers.6088 And in like manner you will inquire
if there are those outside the number of the slaves from whom the householder declares
that he will exact his own with usury, not only men alien from piety, but also some of the
believers. Now the servants alone are the stewards of the Word, but the king, making a
reckoning with the servants, demands from those who have borrowed from the servants,
whether a hundred measures of wheat or a hundred measures of oil,6089 or whatever in
point of fact those who are outside of the household of the king have received; for he who
owed the hundred measures of wheat or the hundred measures of oil is not found to be,
according to the parable, a fellow-servant of the unjust steward, as is evident from the
question—how much owest thou to my lord?6090 But mark with me that each deed which
is good or seemly is like a gain and an increment, but a wicked deed is like a loss; and as
there is a certain gain when the money is greater and another when it is less, and as there
are differences of more or less, so according to the good deeds, there is as it were a valuing
of gains more or less. To reckon what work is a great gain, and what a less gain, and what
a least, is the prerogative of him who alone knows to investigate such things, looking at them
in the light of the disposition, and the word, and the deed, and from consideration of the
things which are not in our power cooperating with those that are; and so also in the case
of things opposite, it is his to say what sin, when a reckoning is made with the servants, is
found to be a great loss, and what is less, and what, if we may so call it, is the loss of the very
last mite,6091 or the last farthing.6092 The account, therefore, of the entire and whole life is
exacted by that which is called the kingdom of heaven which is likened to a king, when “we
must all stand before the judgment-sent of Christ that each one may receive the things done
in the body according to what he hath done, whether good or bad;”6093 and then when the
reckoning is being made, shall there be brought into the reckoning that is made also every
idle word that men shall speak,6094 and any cup of cold water only which one has given to
drink in the name of a disciple.6095</p>

<head>9. The Time Occupied by the Reckoning.</head>
<p>And these things will take place whenever that happens which is written in Daniel, “The
books were opened and the judgment was set;”6096 for a record, as it were, is made of all
things that have been spoken and done and thought, and by divine power every hidden
thing of ours shall be manifested, and everything that is covered shall be revealed,6097 in
order that when any one is found who has not “given diligence to be freed from the ad-
versary,” he may go in succession through the hands of the magistrate, and the judge, and
the attendant into the prison, until he pays the very last mite;6098 but when one has given
diligence to be freed from him and owes nothing to any one, and already has made the
pound ten pounds or five pounds, or doubled the five talents, or made the two four, he may
obtain the due recompense, entering into the joy of his Lord, either being set over all His
possessions,6099 or hearing the word, “Have thou authority over ten cities,”6100 or “Have
thou authority over five cities.”6101 But we think that these things are spoken of as if they
required a long period of time, in order that an account may be made by us of the whole
times of the earthly life, so that we might suppose that when the king makes a reckoning
with each one of his many servants the matter would require so vast a period of time, until
these things come to an end which have existed from the beginning of the world down to
the consummation of the age, not of one age, but of many ages. But the truth is not so; for
when God wished all at once to rekindle in the memories of all everything that had been
done by each one throughout the whole time, in order that each might become conscious
of his own doings whether good or bad, He would do it by His ineffable power. For it is
not with God as with us; for if we wish to call some things to remembrance, we require
sufficient time for the detailed account of what has been said by us, and to bring to our remembrance
the things which we wish to remember; but if He wished to call to our memory
the things which have been done in this life, in order that becoming conscious of what we
have done we may apprehend for what we are punished or honoured, He could do so. But
if any one disbelieves the swiftness of the power of God in regard to these matters, he has
not yet had a true conception of the God who made the universe, who did not require times
to make the vast creation of heaven and earth and the things in them; for, though He may
seem to have made these things in six days, there is need of understanding to comprehend

“in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,”6103 so I think will the judgment also be.</p>

<head>10. The Man Who Owed Many Talents.</head>
<p>Next we must speak in regard to this, “And when he had begun to reckon, there was
brought unto him one which owed many talents.”6104 The sense of this appears to me to be
as follows: The season of beginning the judgment is with the house of God, who says, as
also it is written in Ezekiel, to those who are appointed to attend to punishments, “Begin ye
with My saints;”6105 and it is like “the twinkling of an eye;” but, the time of making a reckoning
includes the same “twinkling,” ideally apprehended, for we are not forgetful of what
has been previously said of those who owe more. Wherefore it is not written, when he was
making reckoning, but it is said, “When he began to reckon,” there was brought, at the beginning
of his making a reckoning, one who owed many talents; he had lost tens of thousands
of talents, having been entrusted with great things, and having had many things committed
to his care, but he had brought no gain to his master, but had lost tens of thousands so that
he owed many talents; and, perhaps on this account, he owed many talents, seeing that he
followed often the woman, who was sitting upon the talent of lead, whose name is wickedness.
6106 But observe here that every great sin is a loss of the talents of the master of the
house, and such sins are committed by fornicators, adulterers, abusers of themselves with
men, effeminate, idolaters, murderers. Perhaps then the one who is brought to the king
owing many talents has committed no small sin but all that are great and heinous; and if
you were to seek for him among men, perhaps you would find him to be “the man of sin,
the son of perdition, he that opposeth and exalteth himself against every God or object of
worship;”6107 but if you seek him outside the number of men, who can this be but the devil
who has ruined so many who received him, who wrought sin in them. For “man is a great
thing, and a pitiful man is precious,”6108 precious so as to be worthy of a talent, whether of
gold like as the lamp which was equal to a talent of gold,6109 or of silver or of any kind of
material whatsoever understood intellectually, the symbols of which are recorded in the
Words of the Days,6110 when David became enriched with many talents of which the
number is mentioned, so many talents of gold, and so many of silver, and of the rest of the
material there named, from which the temple of God was built.</p>

<head>11. The Servant Who Owed a Hundred Pence.</head>
<p>Only, though he cannot pay the talents, for he has lost them, he has a wife and children
and other things, of which it is written, “All that he has.”6111 And it was possible that when
he had been sold along with his own, he would have prospered if some one had bought him,
and, by his worth and the things that were his, have paid the whole debt in full; and it was
possible that he might no longer be the servant of the king, but become that of his purchaser.
And he makes a request that he be not sold along with his own, but may continue to abide
in the house of the king; wherefore he fell down and worshipped him, knowing that the
king was God, and said, “Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all;”6112 for he was, as
is probable, an active man, who knew that he could by a second course of action fill up the
whole deficiency of the former loss of many talents. And this truly good king was moved
with compassion for the man who owed him many talents and then released him, having
bestowed upon him a favour greater than the request which had been made; for the debtor
promised to the long-suffering master to pay all his debts, but the Lord moved with compassion
for him did not merely forgive him with the idea of receiving his own back as a result
of his patience, but even entirely released him and forgave him the whole debt. But this
wicked servant, who had besought his master to have patience for his many talents, acted
without mercy, for, having found one of his fellow-servants which owed him a hundred
pence, he laid hold on him and took him by the throat, saying, “Pay if thou owest.”6113 And
did he not exhibit the very excess of wickedness who laid hold of his fellow-servant for a
hundred pence, and took him by the throat and deprived him of freedom to breathe, when
he himself, for the many talents, had neither been laid hold of, nor seized by the throat, but
at first was ordered to be sold along with his wife and children and all that was his own; but
afterwards, when he had worshipped him, the master was moved with compassion for him,
and he was released and forgiven in regard to the whole of the debt. But it were indeed a
hard task to tell according to the conception of Jesus who is the one fellow-servant who was
found to be owing a hundred pence, not to his own lord, but to him who owed many talents,
and who are the fellow-servants who saw the one taking by the throat, and the other taken,
and were exceedingly sorry, and represented clearly unto their own lord all that had been
done. But what the truth in these matters is, I declare that no one can interpret unless Jesus,
who explained all things to His own disciples privately, takes up His abode in his reason,
and opens up all the treasures in the parable which are dark, hidden, unseen, and confirms
by clear demonstrations the man whom He desires to illumine with the light of the knowledge
of the things that are in this parable, that he may at once represent who is brought to the

king as the debtor of many talents, and who is the other one who owes to him a hundred
pence, etc.; whether he can be the man of sin previously mentioned,6114 or the devil, or
neither of these, but some other, whether a man, or some one of these under the sway of
the devil; for it is a work of the wisdom of God to exhibit the things that have been prophesied
concerning those who are in themselves of a certain nature, or have been made according
to such and such qualities, whether among visible powers or also among some men, in
whatever way they may have been written by the Holy Spirit. But as we have not yet received
the competent mind which is able to be blended with the mind of Christ, and which is capable
of attaining to things so great, and which is able with the Spirit to “search all things, even
the deep things of God,”6115 we, forming an impression still indefinitely with regard to the
matters in this passage, are of opinion that the wicked servant indicated by the parable who
is here represented in regard to the debt of many talents, refers to some definite one.</p>

<head>12. The Time of the Reckoning.</head>
<p>But it is fitting to examine at what time the man—the king—in the parable wished to
make a reckoning with his own servants, and to what period we ought to refer the things
that are said. For if it be after the consummation, or at it at the time of the expected judgment,
how are we to maintain the things about him who owed a hundred pence, and was
taken by the throat by the man who had been forgiven the many talents? But if, before the
judgment, how can we explain the reckoning that was made before this by the king, with
his own servants? But we ought to think in a general way about every parable, the interpretation
of which has not been recorded by the evangelists, even though Jesus explained all
things to His own disciples privately;6116 and for this reason the writers of the Gospels have
concealed the clear exposition of the parables, because the things signified by them were
beyond the power of the nature of words to express, and every solution and exposition of
such parables was of such a kind that not even the whole world itself could contain the books
that should be written6117 in relation to such parables. But it may happen that a fitting heart
be found, and, because of its purity, able to receive the letters of the exposition of the parable,
so that they could be written in it by the Spirit of the living God. But some one will say that,
perhaps, we act with impiety, who, because of the secret and mystical import of some of the
Scriptures which are of heavenly origin, wish them to be symbolic, and endeavour to expound
them, even though it might seem ex hypothesi that we had an accurate knowledge of their
meaning. But to this we must say that, if there be those who have obtained the gift of accurate
apprehension of these things, they know what they ought to do; but as for us, who acknowledge
that we fall short of the ability to see into the depth of the things here signified, even
though we obtain a somewhat crass perception of the things in the passage, we will say, that
some of the things which we seem to find after much examination and inquiry, whether by
the grace of God, or by the power of our own mind, we do not venture to commit to writing;
but some things, for the sake of our own intellectual discipline, and that of those who may
chance to read them, we will to some extent set forth. But let these things, then, be said by
way of apology, because of the depth of the parable; but, with regard to the question at what
time the man—the king—in the parable wished to make a reckoning with his own servants,
we will say that it seems that this takes place about the time of the judgment which had been
proclaimed. And this is confirmed by two parables, one at the close of the Gospel before
us,6118 and one from the Gospel according to Luke.6119 And not to prolong the discussion
by quoting the very letter, as any one who wishes can take it from the Scripture himself, we

<pb n="1006"/>
will say that the parable according to Matthew declares, “For it is as when a man going into
another country called his own servants, and delivered unto them his own goods, and to
one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one talent;”6120 then they took
action with regard to that which had been entrusted to them, and, after a long time, the lord
of those servants cometh, and it is written in the very words, that he also makes a reckoning
with them.6121 And compare the words, “And when he began to make a reckoning,”6122
and consider that he called the going of the householder into another country the time at
which “we are at home in the body but absent from the Lord;”6123 but his advent, when,
“after a long time the lord of those servants cometh,”6124 the time at the consummation in
the judgment; for after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and makes a reckoning
with them, and those things which follow take place. But the parable in Luke represents
with more clearness, that “a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself
a kingdom, and to return,” and when going, “he called ten servants, and gave to them ten
pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye till I come.”6125 But the nobleman, being hated by
his own citizens, who sent an ambassage after him, as they did not wish him to reign over
them, came back again, having received the kingdom, and told the servants to whom he had
given the money to be called to himself that he might know what they had gained by trading.
And, seeing what they had done, to him who had made the one pound ten pounds, rendering
praise in the words, “Well done, thou good servant, because thou wast found faithful in a
very little,”6126 he gives to him authority over ten cities, to-wit, those which were under his
kingdom. And to another, who had multiplied the pound fivefold, he did not render the
praise which he assigned to the first, nor did he specify the word “authority,” as in the case
of the first, but said to him, “Be thou also over five cities.”6127 But to him who had tied up
the pound in a napkin, he said, “Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked
servant;”6128 and he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it unto
him that hath the ten pounds.6129 Who, then, in regard to this parable, will not say that the
nobleman, who goes into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return, is

with the dispensation of the Word which has been committed unto them. And His
citizens who did not wish Him to reign over them when He was a citizen in the world in

<head>13. No Forgiveness to the Unforgiving.</head>
<p>Only, I have said these things with the view of referring his return when he comes with
his kingdom to the consummation, when he commanded the servants to whom he had
given the money to be called to him that he might know what they had gained by trading,
and from a desire to demonstrate from this, and from the parable of the Talents, that the
passage “he who wished to make a reckoning with his own servants”6131 is to be referred
to the consummation when now he is king, receiving the kingdom, on account of which,
according to another parable,6132 he went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom
and to return. Therefore, when he returned after receiving the kingdom, he wished to make
a reckoning with his own servants. And “when he had begun to reckon, there was brought
unto him one who owed many talents,”6133 and he was brought as to a king by those who
had been appointed his ministers—I think, the angels. And perhaps he was one of those
under the kingdom who had been entrusted with a great administration and had not dispensed
it well, but had wasted what had been entrusted to him, so that he came to owe the
many talents which he had lost. This very man, perhaps not having the means to pay, is
ordered by the king to be sold along with his wife, by intercourse with whom he became the
father of certain children. But it is no easy task to see what is intellectually meant by father
and mother and children. What this means in point of truth God may know, and whether
He Himself has given insight to us or not, he who can may judge. Only this is our conception
of the passage; that, as “the Jerusalem which is above” is “the mother”6134 of Paul and of
those like unto him, so there may be a mother of others after the analogy of Jerusalem, the
mother, for example, of Syene in Egypt, or Sidon, or as many cities as are named in the
Scriptures. Then, as Jerusalem is “a bride adorned for her husband,”6135 Christ, so there
may be those mothers of certain powers who have been allotted to them as wives or brides.
And as there are certain children of Jerusalem, as mother, and of Christ, as father, so there
would be certain children of Syene, or Memphis, or Tyre, or Sidon, and the rulers set over
them. Perhaps then, too, this one, the debtor of many talents who was brought to the king,
has, as we have said, a wife and children, whom at first the king ordered to be sold, and also
all that he had to be sold; but afterwards, being moved with compassion, he released him
and forgave him all the debt; not, as if he were ignorant of the future, but, in order that we
might understand what happened, it was written that he did so. Each one then of those who
have, as we have said, a wife and children will render an account whenever the king comes

to make a reckoning, having received the kingdom and having returned; and each of them
as a ruler of any Syene or Memphis, or Tyre or Sidon, or any like unto them, has also debtors.
This one, then, having been released, and having been forgiven all the debt, “went out from
the king and found one of his fellow-servants,”6136 etc.; and, on this account, I suppose that
he took him by the throat, when he had gone out from the king, for unless he had gone out
he would not have taken his own fellow-servant by the throat. Then observe the accuracy
of the Scripture, how that the one fell down and “worshipped,” but the other fell down and
did not worship but “besought;”6137 and the king being moved with compassion released
him and forgave him all the debt, but the servant did not wish even to pity his own fellowservant;
and the king before his release ordered him to be sold and what was his, while he
who had been forgiven cast him into prison. And observe that his fellow-servants did not
bring any accusation or “said,” but “told,”6138 and that he did not use the epithet “wicked”
at the beginning in regard to the money lost, but reserved it afterwards for his action towards
the fellow-servant. But mark also the moderation of the king; he does not say, You worshipped
me, but You besought me; and no longer did he order him and his to be sold, but,
what was worse, he delivered him to the tormentors, because of his wickedness.6139 But
who may these be but those who have been appointed in the matter of punishments? But
at the same time observe, because of the use made of this parable by adherents of heresies,
that if they accuse the Creator6140 of being passionate, because of words that declare the
wrath of God, they ought also to accuse this king, because that “being wroth,” he delivered
the debtor to the tormentors. But it must further be said to those whose view it is that no
one is delivered by Jesus to the tormentors,—pray, explain to us, good sirs, who is the king
who delivered the wicked servant to the tormentors? And let them also attend to this, “So
therefore also shall My heavenly Father do unto you;”6141 and to the same persons also
might rather be said the things in the parable of the Ten Pounds that the Son of the good
God said, “Howbeit these mine enemies which would not that I should reign over them,”6142
etc. The conclusion of the parable, however, is adapted also to the simpler; for all of us who
have obtained the forgiveness of our own sins, and have not forgiven our brethren, are
taught at once that we shall suffer the lot of him who was forgiven but did not forgive his
fellow-servant.</p>

<head>14. How Jesus Finished His Words.</head>
<p>“And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words.”6143 He who gives a detailed
and complete account of each of the questions before him so that nothing is left out, finishes
his own words. But he will give a declaration on this point with more confidence who devotes
himself with great diligence to the entire reading of the Old and New Testament; for if the
expression, “he finished these words,” may be applied to no other, neither to Moses, nor to
any of the prophets, but only to Jesus, then one would dare to say that Jesus alone finished
His words, He who came to put an end to things, and to fulfil what was defective in the law,
by saying, “It was said to them of old time,”6144 etc., and, again, “That the things spoken
through the prophets might be fulfilled.”6145 But if it is written somewhere also in them,
then you may compare and contrast the discourses finished by them with those finished by
the Saviour, that you may find the difference between them. And yet at this point, also, investigation
might be made whether in the case of the things spoken by way of oracle the
expression, “he finished,” is applied either to the things spoken by Moses, or any of the
prophets, or of both together; for careful observation would suggest very weighty thoughts
to those who know how “to compare spiritual things with spiritual,” and on this account
“speak not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth.”6146 But
perhaps some other one, attending with over-curious spirit to the word “finished,” which
is assigned to things of a more mystical order, just as we say that some one delivered to those
who were under his control mysteries and rites of “perfecting”6147 not in a praiseworthy
fashion, and another delivered the mysteries of God to those who are worthy, and rites of
“perfecting” proportionate to such mysteries, might say that having initiated them, he made
a rite of “perfecting,” by which “perfecting” the words were shown to be powerful, so that
the gospel of Jesus was preached in the whole world, and by virtue of the divine “perfecting”
gained the mastery of every soul which the Father draws to the Son, according to what is
said by the Saviour, “No one comes to Me except the Father which has sent Me draw
him.”6148 Wherefore also “the word” of those who by the grace of God are ambassadors of
the gospel, “and their preaching, is not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration

You will therefore observe how often it is said, “He finished,” and of what things it
is said, and you will take as an illustration that which is said in regard to the beatitudes, and
the whole of the discourse to which is subjoined, “And it came to pass when Jesus had finished
these words, all the multitudes were astonished at His teaching.”6150 But now the saying,
“Jesus finished these words,” is referred also immediately to the very mystical parable according
to which the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a king, but also beyond this parable

<p>Only, when Jesus had finished these words, having spoken them in Galilee about Capernaum,
then “He departed thence, and came into the borders of Judæa,”6151 which were
different from Galilee. But He came to the borders of Judæa, and not to the middle of it,
but, as it were, to the outermost parts, where great multitudes followed Him,6152 whom He
healed at “the borders of Judæa beyond Jordan,”—where baptism had been given.6153 But
you will observe the difference between the crowds who simply followed, and Peter and the
others who gave up everything and followed, and Matthew, who arose and followed him;6154
he did not simply follow, but “having arisen;” for “having arisen” is an important addition.
There are always those, then, who follow like the great multitudes, who have not arisen that
they may follow, nor have given up all that was theirs formerly, but few are they who have
arisen and followed, who also, in the regeneration, shall sit on twelve thrones.6155 Only, if
one wishes to be healed, let him follow Jesus.</p>

<head>16. Concerning the Pharisees and Scribes Tempting Jesus (by Asking) Whether Was
Lawful for a Man to Put Away His Wife for Every Cause.</head>
<p>After this it is written that “there came unto Him the Pharisees tempting Him and saying,
Is it lawful for a man to wife for every cause?”6156 Mark, also, has written to the like effect.6157
Accordingly, of those who came to Jesus and inquired of Him, there were some who put
questions to tempt Him; and if our Saviour so transcendent was tempted, which of His
disciples who is ordained to teach need be vexed, when he is tempted by some who inquire,
not from the love of learning, but from the wish to tempt? And you might find many passages,
if you brought them together, in which the Pharisees tempted our Jesus, and others,
different from them, as a certain lawyer,6158 and perhaps also a scribe,6159 that by bringing
together what is said about those who tempted Him, you might find by investigation what
is useful for this kind of inquiries. Only, the Saviour, in response to those who tempted
Him, laid down dogmas; for they said, “Is it lawful for a man to put away his own wife for
every cause?” and He answered and said, “Have ye not read that He who created them from
the beginning made them male and female?”6160 etc. And I think that the Pharisees put
forward this word for this reason, that they might attack Him whatever He might say; as,
for example, if He had said, “It is lawful,” they would have accused Him of dissolving marriages
for trifles; but, if He had said, “It is not lawful,” they would have accused Him of
permitting a man to dwell with a woman, even with sins; so, likewise, in the case of the
tribute-money,6161 if He had told them to give, they would have accused Him of making
the people subject to the Romans, and not to the law of God, but if He had told them not
to give, they would have accused Him of creating war and sedition, and of stirring up those
who were not able to stand against so powerful an army. But they did not perceive in what
way He answered blamelessly and wisely, in the first place, rejecting the opinion that a wife
was to be put away for every cause, and, in the second place, giving answer to the question
about the bill of divorcement; for He saw that not every cause is a reasonable ground for
the dissolution of marriage, and that the husband must dwell with the wife as the weaker
vessel, giving honour,6162 and bearing her burdens in sins;6163 and by what is written in
Genesis, He puts to shame the Pharisees who boasted in the Scriptures of Moses, by saying,

“Have ye not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,”
etc., and, subjoining to these words, because of the saying, “And the twain shall become
one flesh,” teaching in harmony with one flesh, namely, “So that they are no more twain,
but one flesh.”6164 And, as tending to convince them that they should not put away their
wife for every cause, is it said, “What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”6165
It is to be observed, however, in the exposition of the words quoted from Genesis in the
Gospel, that they were not spoken consecutively as they are written in the Gospel; and I
think that it is not even said about the same persons, namely, of those who were formed
after the image of God, and of those who were formed from the dust of the ground and from
one of the ribs of Adam. For where it is said, “Male and female made He them,”6166 the
reference is to those formed “after the image,” but where He also said, “For this cause shall
a man leave his own father and mother,”6167 etc., the reference is not to those formed after
the image; for some time after the Lord God formed the man, taking dust from the ground,
and from his side the helpmate. And mark, at the same time, that in the case of those who
are formed “after the image,” the words were not “husband and wife” but “male and female.”
But we have also observed this in the Hebrew, for man is indicated by the word “is,” but
male by the word “zachar,” and again woman by the word “essa,” but female by the word
“agkeba.” For at no time is it “woman” or “man” “after the image,” but the superior class,
the male, and the second, the female. But also if a man leave his mother and his father, he
cleaves not to the female, but to his own wife, and “they become,” since man and woman
are one in flesh, “one flesh.” Then, describing what ought to be in the case of those who are
joined together by God, so that they may be joined together in a manner worthy of God,
the Saviour adds, “So that they are no more twain;”6168 and, wherever there is indeed concord,
and unison, and harmony, between husband and wife, when he is as ruler and she is obedient
to the word, “He shall rule over thee,”6169 then of such persons we may truly say, “They are
no more twain.” Then since it was necessary that for “him who was joined to the Lord,” it
should be reserved “that he should become one spirit with Him,”6170 in the case of those
who are joined together by God, after the words, “So that they are no more twain,” it is said,
“but one flesh.” And it is God who has joined together the two in one so that they are no
more twain, from the time that6171 the woman is married to the man. And, since God has

joined them together, on this account in the case of those who are joined together by God,
there is a “gift”; and Paul knowing this, that marriage according to the Word of God was a
“gift,” like as holy celibacy was a gift, says, “But I would that all men were like myself; howbeit,
each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.”6172
And those who are joined together by God both mind and keep the precept, “Husbands
love your wives, as Christ also the church.”6173 The Saviour then commanded, “What God
hath joined together, let not man put asunder,”6174 but man wishes to put asunder what
God hath joined together, when, “falling away from the sound faith, giving heed to seducing
spirits and doctrines of demons, through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in
their own conscience as with a hot iron, forbidding,” not only to commit fornication, but
“to marry,”6175 he dissolves even those who had been before joined together by the
providence of God. Let these things then be said, keeping in view what is expressly said
concerning the male and the female, and the man and the woman, as the Saviour taught in
the answer to the Pharisees.</p>

<head>17. Union of Christ and the Church.</head>
<p>But since the Apostle understands the words, “And they twain shall be one flesh,”6176
of Christ and the church,6177 we must say that Christ keeping the saying, “What God hath
joined together let not man put asunder,”6178 did not put away His former wife, so to
speak—that is, the former synagogue—for any other cause than that that wife committed
fornication, being made an adulteress by the evil one, and along with him plotted against
her husband and slew Him, saying, “Away with such a fellow from the earth, crucify Him,
crucify Him.”6179 It was she therefore who herself revolted, rather than her husband who
put her away and dismissed her; wherefore, reproaching her for falling away from him, it
says in Isaiah, “Of what kind is the bill of your mother’s divorcement, with which I sent her
away?”6180 And He who at the beginning created Him “who is in the form of God” after
the image, made Him male, and the church female, granting to both oneness after the image.
And, for the sake of the church, the Lord—the husband—left the Father whom He saw when
He was “in the form of God,”6181 left also His mother, as He was the very son of the Jerusalem
which is above, and was joined to His wife who had fallen down here, and these two here
became one flesh. For because of her, He Himself also became flesh, when “the Word became
flesh and dwelt among us,”6182 and they are no more two, but now they are one flesh, since
it is said to the wife, “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members each in his part;”6183 for
the body of Christ is not something apart different from the church, which is His body, and
from the members each in his part. And God has joined together these who are not two,
but have become one flesh, commanding that men should not separate the church from the
Lord. And he who takes heed for himself so as not to be separated, is confident as one who
will not possibly be separated and says, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?”6184
Here, therefore, the saying, “What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder,”6185
was written with relation to the Pharisees, but to those who are superior to the Pharisees, it
could be said, “What then God hath joined together, let nothing put asunder,” neither

<head>18. The Bill of Divorcement.</head>
<p>After this we will discuss the saying of the Pharisees which they said to Jesus, “Why then
did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement and put her away?”6186 And with good
reason we will bring forward for this purpose the passage from Deuteronomy concerning
the bill of divorcement, which is as follows: “But if a man taketh a wife and cohabit with
her, and it shall be, if she do not find favour in his sight because he hath found in her a thing
unseemly,” etc., down to the words, “and ye shall not pollute the land which the Lord your
God giveth you for an inheritance.”6187 Now I inquire whether in these things according
to this law, we are to seek nothing in it beyond the letter seeing that God has not given it,
or whether to the Pharisees who quoted the saying, “Moses commanded to give a bill of divorcement
and put her away,” it was of necessity said, “Moses, for your hardness of heart,
suffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it hath not been so.”6188 But
if any one ascends to the Gospel of Christ Jesus which teaches that the law is spiritual, he
will seek also the spiritual understanding of this law. And he who wishes to interpret these
things figuratively will say that, just as it was said by Paul confident in the grace which he
had, “A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth, but if the husband be dead she
is free to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord; but she is happier if she abide as
she is, after my judgment, and I think that I also have the Spirit of God”6189 (for here to the
words, “after my judgment,” lest it should be despised as being without the Spirit of God,
he well added, “and I think that I also have the Spirit of God),” so also it would be possible
for Moses, by reason of the power given to him to make laws, to the effect that he suffered
for the hardness of heart of the people certain things, among which was the putting away
of wives, to be persuaded in regard to the laws which he promulgated according to his own
judgment, that in these also the legislation took place with the Spirit of God. And he will
say that, unless one law is spiritual and another is not such, this is a law, and this is spiritual,
and its spiritual significance ought to be investigated.</p>

<head>19. The Divorce of Israel.</head>
<p>Now, keeping in mind what we said above in regard to the passage from Isaiah about
the bill of divorcement, we will say that the mother of the people separated herself from
Christ, her husband, without having received the bill of divorcement, but afterwards when
there was found in her an unseemly thing, and she did not find favour in his sight, the bill
of divorcement was written out for her; for when the new covenant called those of the
Gentiles to the house of Him who had cast away his former wife, it virtually gave the bill of
divorcement to her who formerly separated from her husband—the law, and the Word.
Therefore he, also, having separated from her, married, so to speak, another, having given
into the hands of the former the bill of divorcement; wherefore they can no longer do the
things enjoined on them by the law, because of the bill of divorcement. And a sign that she
has received the bill of divorcement is this, that Jerusalem was destroyed along with what
they called the sanctuary of the things in it which were believed to be holy, and with the altar
of burnt offerings, and all the worship associated with it. And a further sign of the bill of
divorcement is this, that they cannot keep their feasts, even though according to the letter
of the law designedly commanded them, in the place which the Lord God appointed to them
for keeping feasts; but there is this also, that the whole synagogue has become unable to
stone those who have committed this or that sin; and thousands of things commanded are
a sign of the bill of divorcement; and the fact that “there is no more a prophet,” and that
they say, “We no longer see signs;”6190 for the Lord says, “He hath taken away from Judæa
and from Jerusalem,” according to the word of Isaiah, “Him that is mighty, and her that is
mighty, a powerful giant,” etc., down to the words, “a prudent hearer.”6191 Now, He who
is the Christ may have taken the synagogue to wife and cohabited with her, but it may be
that afterwards she found not favour in His sight; and the reason of her not having found
favour in His sight was, that there was found in her an unseemly thing; for what was more
unseemly than the circumstance that, when it was proposed to them to release one at the
feast, they asked for the release of Barabbas the robber, and the condemnation of Jesus?6192
And what was more unseemly than the fact, that they all said in His case, “Crucify Him,
crucify Him,” and “Away with such a fellow from the earth”?6193 And can this be freed
from the charge of unseemliness, “His blood be upon us, and upon our children”?6194
Wherefore, when He was avenged, Jerusalem was compassed with armies, and its desolation

was near,6195 and their house was taken away from it, and “the daughter of Zion was left as
a booth in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a besieged city.”6196
And, about the same time, I think, the husband wrote out a bill of divorcement to his former
wife, and gave it into her hands, and sent her away from his own house, and the bond of
her who came from the Gentiles has been cancelled about which the Apostle says, “Having
blotted out the bond written in ordinances, which was contrary to us, and He hath taken it
out of the way, nailing it to the cross;”6197 for Paul also and others became proselytes of Israel
for her who came from the Gentiles.6198 The first wife, accordingly, not having found favour
before her husband, because in her had been found an unseemly thing, went out from the
dwelling of her husband, and, going away, has become joined to another man, to whom she
has subjected herself, whether we should call the husband Barabbas the robber, who is figuratively
the devil, or some evil power. And in the case of some of that synagogue there has
happened the former thing which was written in the law, but in the case of others, that which
was second. For the last husband6199 hated his wife and will write out for her some day at
the consummation of things a bill of divorcement, when God so orders it, and will give it
into her hands and will send her away from his dwelling; for as the good God will put enmity
between the serpent and the woman, and between his seed and her seed,6200 so will He order
it that the last husband shall hate her.</p>

<head>20. Christ and the Gentiles.</head>
<p>Now there are those in whose case it has happened that the man dwells with them
without having hated them, because they abide in the house of the last husband, who took
to himself their synagogue as wife. But also in their case the latter husband dies,6201 perhaps
whenever the last enemy of Christ, death, is destroyed. But whichever of these things may
happen, whether the former or the latter to the wife, the former husband, it says, who sent
her away, will not he able to turn back and take her to be a wife to himself after she has been
defiled, since “it is abomination,” it says, “before the Lord thy God.”6202 But these things
will not seem to be consistent with this, “If the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, all Israel
shall be saved.”6203 But consider if it can be said to this, that, if she shall be saved by her
former husband returning and taking her to himself as wife, she will in any case be saved
after she has been polluted. A priest, then, will not take to himself as a wife one who has
been a harlot and an outcast,6204 but no other, as being inferior to the priest, is hindered
from doing so. But if you seek for the harlot in regard to the calling of the Gentiles, you
may use the passage, “Take to yourself a wife of fornication, and children of fornication,”6205
etc.; for, as “the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless,”6206 so he who,
casting out his former wife, takes in due season “a wife of fornication,” having done it according
to the command of Him who says, when it is necessary, and so long as it was neces-
sary, “He shall not take a harlot to wife,” and, when it was reasonable, He says, “Take to
yourself a wife of fornication.” For as the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath,6207 and not
the slave of the sabbath as the people are, so He who gives the law has power to give it “until
a time of reformation,”6208 and to change the law, and, when the time of the reformation
is at hand, also to give after the former way and after the former heart another way and another
heart, “in an acceptable time, and in a day of salvation.”6209 And let these things be
said according to our interpretation of the law in regard to the bill of divorcement.</p>

<head>21. Union of Angels and the Souls of Men.</head>
<p>But some one may inquire whether the human soul can be figuratively called a wife,
and the angel who is set over her and is her ruler, with whom as her sovereign she holds
conversation, can be called her husband; so that according to this each lawfully dwells along
with the soul which is worthy of the guardianship of a divine angel; but sometimes after
long sojourning and intercourse a cause may arise in the soul why she does not find favour
in the eyes of the angel who is her lord and ruler, because that in it there is found an unseemly
thing; and bonds may be written out, as such are written, and a bill of divorcement be
written and put into the hands of her who is cast out, so that she may no longer be familiar
with her former guardian, when she is cast out from his dwelling. And even she who has
gone away from her former dwelling may be joined to another husband, and be unfortunate
with him, not only, as in the case of the former, not finding favour in his sight because an
unseemly thing was found in her, but even being hated by him.6210 Yea, and even there
might be written out from the second husband a bill of divorcement and it might be put
into her hands from the last husband who sends her away from his dwelling. But whether
there can be such a change of the life of angels with men, as to amount, so far as concerns
their relation to us, to their death, one may put the question rash though it be; but be that
as it may, she also who has once fallen away from the former husband will not return again
to him, for the former husband who sent her away will not be able to turn back and take
her as wife to himself, after she was defiled.6211 And if one should dare, using a Scripture
which is in circulation in the church, but not acknowledged by all to be divine, to soften
down a precept of this kind, the passage might be taken from The Shepherd, concerning
some who as soon as they believe are put in subjection to Michael,6212 but falling away from
him from love of pleasure, are put in subjection to the angel of luxury,6213 then to the angel
of punishment,6214 and after this to the angel of repentance; for you observe that the wife
or soul who has once been given to luxury no longer returns to the first ruler, but also besides
suffering punishment, is put in subjection to one inferior to Michael; for the angel of penitence
is inferior to him. We must therefore take heed lest there be found in us any unseemly
thing, and we should not find favour in the eyes of our husband Christ, or of the angel who
has been set over us. For if we do not take heed, perhaps we also shall receive the bill of di-

it is not of good omen to receive, as it were, the marriage of an angel with our own soul.6215</p>

<head>22. The Marriage of Church Dignitaries.</head>
<p>But, while dealing with the passage, I would say that we will be able perhaps now to
understand and clearly set forth a question which is hard to grasp and see into, with regard
to the legislation of the Apostle concerning ecclesiastical matters; for Paul wishes no one of
those of the church, who has attained to any eminence beyond the many, as is attained in
the administration of the sacraments, to make trial of a second marriage. For laying down
the law in regard to bishops in the first Epistle to Timothy, he says, “If a man seeketh the
office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. The bishop, therefore, must be without reproach,
the husbands of one wife, temperate, sober-minded,”6216 etc.; and, in regard to deacons,
“Let the deacons,” he says, “be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own
houses well,”6217 etc. Yea, and also when appointing widows, he says, “Let there be no one
as a widow under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man;”6218 and after this
he says the things superadded, as being second or third in importance to this. And, in the
Epistle to Titus, “For this cause,” he says, “I left thee in Crete that thou shouldest set in order
the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city as I gave thee charge. If any
one is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children, that believe”6219—of course—and
so on. Now, when we saw that some who have been married twice may be much better than
those who have been married once, we were perplexed why Paul does not at all permit those
who have been twice married to be appointed to ecclesiastical dignities; for also it seemed
to me that such a thing was worthy of examination, as it was possible that a man, who had
been unfortunate in two marriages, and had lost his second wife while he was yet young,
might have lived for the rest of his years up to old age in the greatest self-control and chastity.
Who, then, would not naturally be perplexed why at all, when a ruler of the church is being
sought for, we do not appoint such a man, though he has been twice married, because of
the expressions about marriage, but lay hold of the man who has been once married as our
ruler, even if he chance to have lived to old age with his wife, and sometimes may not have
been disciplined in chastity and temperance? But, from what is said in the law about the
bill of divorcement, I reflect whether, seeing that the bishop and the presbyter and the deacon
are a symbol of things that truly exist in accordance with these names, he wished to appoint
those who were figuratively once married, in order that he who is able to give attention to
the matter, may find out from the spiritual law the one who was unworthy of ecclesiastical
rule, whose soul did not find favour in the eyes of her husband because there had been found
in her an unseemly thing, and she had become worthy of the bill of divorcement; for such

a soul, having dwelt along with a second husband, and having been hated by such an one,
can no longer, after the second bill of divorcement, return to her former husband.6220 It is
likely, therefore, also, that other arguments will be found by those who are wiser than we,
and have more ability to see into such things, whether in the law about the bill of divorcement,
or in the apostolic writings which prohibit those who have been twice married from ruling
over the church or being preferred to preside over it. But, until something shall be found
that is better and able by the excessive brilliancy of the light of knowledge to cast into the
shade what we have uttered, we have said the things which have occurred to us in regard to
the passages.</p>

<head>23. Some Laws Given by Concession to Human Weakness.</head>
<p>But, even if we have seemed to touch on things too deep for our capacity in the passages,
nevertheless, because of the literal expression these things must further be said, that some
of the laws were written not as excellent, but as by way of accommodation to the weakness
of those to whom the law was given; for something of this kind is indicated in the words,
“Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives;”6221 but that which
is pre-eminent and superior to the law, which was written for their hardness of heart, is indicated
in this, “But from the beginning it hath not been so.” But in the new covenant also
there are some legal injunctions of the same order as, “Moses for your hardness of heart
suffered you to put away your wives;” for example, because of our hardness of heart, it has
been written on account of our weakness, “But because of fornications, let each man have
his own wife and let each woman have her own husband;”6222 and this, “Let the husband
render unto the wife her due, and likewise also the wife unto the husband.”6223 To these
sayings it is accordingly subjoined, “But this I say by way of permission, not of commandment.”
6224 But this also, “A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth, but if her
husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord,”6225 was said
by Paul in view of our hardness of heart and weakness, to those who do not wish to desire
earnestly the greater gifts6226 and become more blessed. But now contrary to what was
written, some even of the rulers of the church have permitted a woman to marry, even when
her husband was living, doing contrary to what was written, where it is said, “A wife is bound
for so long time as her husband liveth,” and “So then if while her husband liveth, she shall
be joined to another man she shall be called an adulteress,”6227 not indeed altogether without
reason, for it is probable this concession was permitted in comparison with worse things,
contrary to what was from the beginning ordained by law, and written.</p>

<head>24. Jewish Criticism of the Law of Christ.</head>
<p>But perhaps some Jewish man of those who dare to oppose the teaching of our Saviour
will say, that when Jesus said, “Whosoever shall put away his own wife, saving for the cause
of fornication, maketh her an adulteress,”6228 He also gave permission to put away a wife
like as well as Moses did, who was said by Him to have given laws for the hardness of heart
of the people, and will hold that the saying, “Because he found in her an unseemly thing,”6229
is to be reckoned as the same as fornication on account of which with good cause a wife
could be cast away from her husband. But to him it must be said that, if she who committed
adultery was according to the law to be stoned, clearly it is not in this sense that the unseemly
thing is to be understood. For it is not necessary for adultery or any such great indecency
to write a bill of divorcement and give it into the hands of the wife; but indeed perhaps
Moses called every sin an unseemly thing, on the discovery of which by the husband in the
wife, as not finding favour in the eyes of her husband, the bill of divorcement is written, and
the wife is sent away from the house of her husband; “but from the beginning it hath not
been so.”6230 After this our Saviour says, not at all permitting the dissolution of marriages
for any other sin than fornication alone, when detected in the wife, “Whosoever shall put
away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress.”6231 But
it might be a subject for inquiry if on this account He hinders any one putting away a wife,
unless she be caught in fornication, for any other reason, as for example for poisoning, or
for the destruction during the absence of her husband from home of an infant born to them,
or for any form of murder whatsoever. And further, if she were found despoiling and pillaging
the house of her husband, though she was not guilty of fornication, one might ask if
he would with reason cast away such an one, seeing that the Saviour forbids any one to put
away his own wife saving for the cause of fornication. In either case there appears to be
something monstrous, whether it be really monstrous, I do not know; for to endure sins of
such heinousness which seem to be worse than adultery or fornication, will appear to be
irrational; but again on the other hand to act contrary to the design of the teaching of the
Saviour, every one would acknowledge to be impious. I wonder therefore why He did not
say, Let no one put away his own wife saving for the cause of fornication, but says, “Whosoever
shall put away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress.”
6232 For confessedly he who puts away his wife when she is not a fornicator, makes
her an adulteress, so far as it lies with him, for if, “when the husband is living she shall be

<pb n="1028"/>
called an adulteress if she be joined to another man;”6233 and when by putting her away, he
gives to her the excuse of a second marriage, very plainly in this way he makes her an adulteress.
But as to whether her being caught in the act of poisoning or committing murder,
furnishes any defence of his dismissal of her, you can inquire yourselves; for the husband
can also in other ways than by putting her away cause his own wife to commit adultery; as,
for example, allowing her to do what she wishes beyond what is fitting, and stooping to
friendship with what men she wishes, for often from the simplicity of husbands such false
steps happen to wives; but whether there is a ground of defence or not for such husbands
in the case of such false steps, you will inquire carefully, and deliver your opinion also in
regard to the difficult questions raised by us on the passage. And even he who withholds
himself from his wife makes her oftentimes to be an adulteress when he does not satisfy her
desires, even though he does so under the appearance of greater gravity and self-control.
And perhaps this man is more culpable who, so far as it rests with him, makes her an adulteress
when he does not satisfy her desires than he who, for other reason than fornication,
has sent her away,—for poisoning or murder or any of the most grievous sins. But as a
woman is an adulteress, even though she seem to be married to a man, while the former
husband is still living, so also the man who seems to marry her who has been put away, does
not so much marry her as commit adultery with her according to the declaration of our
Saviour.</p>

<head>25. Chastity and Prayer.</head>
<p>Now after these things, having considered how many possible accidents may arise in
marriages, which it was necessary for the man to endure and in this way suffer very great
hardships, or if he did not endure, to transgress the word of Christ, the disciples say to him,
taking refuge in celibacy as easier, and more expedient than marriage, though the latter ap-
pears to be expedient, “If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to
marry.”6234 And to this the Saviour said, teaching us that absolute chastity is a gift given
by God, and not merely the fruit of training, but given by God with prayer, “All men cannot
receive the saying, but they to whom it is given.”6235 Then seeing that some make a sophistical
attack on the saying. “To whom it is given,” as if those who wished to remain pure in
celibacy, but were mastered by their desires, had an excuse, we must say that, if we believe
the Scriptures, why at all do we lay hold of the saying, “But they to whom it is given,” but
no longer attend to this, “Ask and it shall be given you,”6236 and to that which is added to
it, “For every one that asketh receiveth”?6237 For if they “to whom it is given” can receive
this saying about absolute purity, let him who wills ask, obeying and believing Him who
said, “Ask and it shall be given you,”6238 and not doubting about the saying, “Every one
that asketh receiveth.”6239 But when there you will inquire who it is that asketh, for no one
of those who do not receive has asked, even though he seems to have done so, since it is not
lawful to say that the saying, “Every one that asketh receiveth,” is a lie. Who then is he that
asketh, but he who has obeyed Jesus when He says, “If ye stand praying, believe that ye receive,
and ye shall receive”?6240 But he that asketh must do everything in his power that he
may pray “with the spirit” and pray also “with the understanding,”6241 and pray “without
ceasing,”6242 keeping in mind also the saying, “And He spake a parable unto them to the
end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint, saying, There was in a city a judge,”6243
etc. And it is useful to know what it is to ask, and what it is to receive, and what is meant
by “Every one that asketh, receiveth,”6244 and by “I say unto you though he will not rise and

as many as he needeth.”6245 It is therefore added, “And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be
given you,” and so on. Further, let the saying, “All men cannot receive the saying but they
to whom it is given,”6246 be a stimulus to us to ask worthily of receiving; and this, “What
son is there of you who shall ask his father for a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent,”6247
etc. God therefore will give the good gift, perfect purity in celibacy and chastity, to those
who ask Him with the whole soul, and with faith, and in prayers without ceasing.</p>

<head>You might also enjoy these classic Christian books from the CCEL:</head>
<head>ANF08. The Twelve Patriarchs, Excerpts and Epistles, The Clementia,
Apocrypha, Decretals, Memoirs of Edessa and Syriac Documents,
Remains of the First by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene Fathers, brings together the
work of early Christian thinkers. In particular, it brings together the writings of the early
Church fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These volumes are noteworthy
for their inclusion of entire texts, and not simply fragments or excerpts from these great
writings. The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and scholars with a good
approximation of the originals. These writings were heavily influential on the early Church,
and for good reason, as they are inspirational and encouraging. These volumes also come
with many useful notes, providing the reader with new levels of understanding. Overall,
Ante-Nicene Fathers, or any part of it, is a welcome addition to one's reading list.</p>
